    A script to update/install the latest versions of all the most
    important Common Lisp packages.
  </p>

  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>
    clbuild is a shell script helping with the download, compilation, an
    invocation of Common Lisp applications.  It defaults to SBCL but
    otherwise tries to be somewhat independent of your local
    environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    clbuild was originally written by Luke Gorrie.
    (Idea from jhbuild by James Henstridge, a Gnome hacker).
  </p>

<!--

    The last time someone updated this web page, the following libraries and
    applications were supported as part of the main project list:

  <h3>FAQ</h3>

  <p>
    <b> How does clbuild differ from asdf-install?
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
     clbuild includes a list of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000077">selected</span> libraries
    and applications and their <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000077">well-known locations</span>, and
    downloads the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000077">newest version or CVS/SVN/darcs repositories</span> if
    possible.  It can also build SBCL for you and includes convenient
    commands to start various applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>In contrast</i>, asdf-install can install <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000077">any software</span>
    listed on Cliki.  It always downloads <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000077">release tarballs</span>.  (It
    is up to the user to hunt down the trustworthy <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000077">PGP keys as a
    protection agains malicous wiki entries</span>.)

    <div>
      <b> Why did you get rid of all tarball-only downloads?
    </b>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>
       <p>
         We use version-controlled download mechanisms to avoid losing local
	 changes when updating.
       </p>
       <p>
	 clbuild's source directory is meant as an area
	 where hackers can do their work, and we wouldn't feel confident
	 recommending it for that purpose if we had to delete and move
	 directories or extract tarballs in there.
       </p>
       <p>
	 Instead, we have the <a
	 href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/mirror/">clbuild
	 mirror</a> with darcs conversions of tarball-only projects.
       </p>
       <p>
	 (Future versions of clbuild <i>might</i> do that darcs conversion
	 on-the-fly somewhere in a new directory clbuild/import, and then use
	 darcs pull from that directory into clbuild/source.  The downside of
	 that approach would be that different users (and separate clbuild
	 checkouts by the same user) would have incompatible darcs checkouts
	 for the same project.)</p>

    <div>
      Yes, that's the default.  But you can change it in
      clbuild.conf using the USER_INIT configuration variable.

  <p>
    <div>
      Yes, you can change that behaviour in clbuild.conf  using the

    <div>
      Yes, using "clbuild record-dependencies", which requires a complete
      check-out of all projects, including wnpp-projects.<br>
      <br>
      You don't have to run this command when sending us patches for new
      projects.  Anyone merging such a patch will rebuild the dependencies
      before comitting anyway.<br>

    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>
      <p> This file is an educated guess and sometimes not perfect.  We prefer
      to err on the side of too many dependencies rather than too few.
      </p>
      <p>
However, the following situations are <i>not</i> necessarily bugs:
      </p>
      <ul>
  	<li>
   circular dependencies:
    (cffi depends on trivial-features, which depends on cffi itself.
    That is <i>not</i> a problem.
  <li> non-transitive dependencies:
    (if A depends on B, which depends on C, it does <i>not</i> follow that A
    depends on C.)
   </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
Make sure to distinguish between project dependencies and system
dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
The following process computes the "project dependencies" of a project
FOO:
      </p>
      <ul>
  <li> look for all files named clbuild/source/FOO/*.asd and load them.
    (Except for some special projects that force us to scan recursively
    for asd files.)
  <li> for each system BAR that we found a file FOO/bar.asd for, compute
    the systems that BAR depends on.
    (ASDF provides no function that I am aware of to find those
    dependencies, so we scan the in-order-to slot to make an educated
    guess what those dependencies are.)
    As an extra exception, we sometimes add dependencies at this point,
    for example to force mcclim to always depend on cffi, no matter
    whether the caller currently has gtkairo enabled or not.

  <li> for each such system that is a dependency, map the system back to
    its asd file, and if that asd file is found somewhere in
    clbuild/source/BAZ/, consider it to be part of project BAZ

  <li> The projects found in the last step are the dependencies of FOO.
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
This process implies that dependencies between projects are not
transitive.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, the project `babel' depends on the project `rt' because the
system BABEL-TEST depends on the system RT.
      </p>
      <p>
But the system HUNCHENTOOT depends only on BABEL, not BABEL-TEST, so the
project `hunchentoot' does not depend on the project `rt'.
      </p>
      <p>
Think about "clbuild update hunchentoot" as "install everything I need
to use/hack all parts of hunchentoot", which doesn't include BABEL-TEST
or RT.  "clbuild update babel" means "install everything I need to
use/hack babel", which includes BABEL-TEST and hence RT.

      <b>Why is clbuild written in shell?  Lisp is so much better.
    </b>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>
There are many answers to this question.  Here are just a few of them:

  <ul>
  <li> Luke originally wrote clbuild as a shell script.

  <li> clbuild is not a mere shell script.  At least `recompile' and
    `record-dependencies' are now written in Lisp.

  <li> We basically just call out to darcs, git, cvs, and svn anyway.

  <li> Thanks to the shell script, we can install lisp projects before
    having built a clean SBCL, and without having to worry whether the
    Lisp in $PATH is good enough.

  <li> Building SBCL from a shell script seems like a natural thing to do.

  <li> Other projects have tried to explore different parts of the design
    space for lisp software installers.  There is cl-librarian written
    in Lisp, clget written in Perl, and so on.
      </ul>
      </p>

      <b> Does it work on cygwin?
    </b>
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>
       It used to work on cygwin.
       Beware that cygwin support is tested only occasionally and might
       not be complete or functional anymore.

       (In any case, you need to recompile SBCL with
	an <a href="http://www.lichteblau.com/blubba/shortcut/">ASDF
	patch for shortcut support</a> first.)
    To start clbuild's slime, make sure to use the Windows version of
    Emacs, not cygwin's Emacs.

  <h3>Download and Usage</h3>

  <p>
    clbuild is maintained in darcs.
  </p>
  <pre>$ <b>darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/clbuild</b></pre>

  <p>You might want to make the shell script executable:</p>
  <pre>$ <b>cd clbuild</b>
clbuild$ <b>chmod +x clbuild</b></pre>

  <p>
    clbuild depends on various helper applications.
    Try <tt>check</tt> to make sure they are installed:
  </p>
  <pre>clbuild$ <b>./clbuild check</b>
Checking for helper applications...
found /usr/bin/X11/cvs
found /usr/bin/X11/svn
found /usr/bin/X11/darcs
found /usr/bin/X11/wget
found /bin/tar
found /bin/mktemp
Success: All helper applications found.

Checking Lisp startup...
Success: Lisp starts up using "sbcl"

Looking for installable systems...

  <p>
    Use <tt>list</tt> to search for projects:
  </p>
  <pre>clbuild$ <b>./clbuild list web</b>
i cl-webdav              WebDAV server
i closure                CLIM-based web browser
i hunchentoot            web server formerly known as TBNL</pre>
  <p>
    Run <tt>update</tt> to download the userland:
  </p>
  <pre>clbuild$ <b>./clbuild update --main-projects</b>
cvs co flexichain...
cvs co mcclim...
<i>... lots of output not shown ...</i>
update complete                                                   
46 systems definition files registered</pre>

  <p>
    You do not have to download all default projects (and in particular,
    wnpp-projects are not part of the default download anyway).  Instead,
    you can specify a particular project, and download it with its
    dependencies only:
  </p>
  <pre>clbuild$ <b>./clbuild update climacs</b>
clbuild update climacs
climacs depends on: climacs clx flexichain mcclim slime spatial-trees 
include dependencies in update? (Y/n)<b>y</b>
cvs co climacs...
cvs co clx...
<i>... lots of output not shown ...</i></pre>
  <p>
    To reduce start up times, you can dump a core file including all
    main projects (or the projects specified on the command line, just like
    with <i>update</i>):
  </p>
  <pre>clbuild$ <b>./clbuild climacs</b>   # slow, from fasls
clbuild$ <b>./clbuild dumpcore climacs</b>
...
clbuild$ <b>./clbuild climacs</b>   # fast, using monster.core</pre>
  <h3>Building SBCL</h3>
  <p>
    You can also download and recompile SBCL using <tt>buildsbcl</tt>
    or <tt>buildworld</tt>:
  </p>
  clbuild$ <b>./clbuild buildsbcl</b></pre>

  <h3>Command line arguments</h3>
  <p>
    For other options, see <tt>help</tt>:
  </p>
  <pre>clbuild$ <b>./clbuild help</b>
Usage:
  check         check availability of all necessary helper applications

  list [PATTERN]  list all projects, or projects matching PATTERN

  update [--dependencies|--no-dependencies] PROJECT_NAME
                download/update this project
  update [--resume]
                download/update main projects.  With --resume, consider
                only projects that a previous update run failed to fetch.
  skip PROJECT_NAME
                mark this project as done for the purposes of update --resume

  recompile [PROJECT_NAME] recompile main applications (or just PROJECT_NAME)
  dumpcore [PROJECT_NAME]  recompile and dump a core file for faster startup
  build [PROJECT_NAME]     update &amp;&amp; dumpcore

  diff          show local changes (for all version-controlled projects)
  check-urls    compared installed repository urls agains current locations
  clean-links   remove broken symlinks in systems/
  update-missing  download only projects not present yet
  register-asd PROJECT  add .asd file symlinks for PROJECT

  buildsbcl [XC_HOST]  download/update and compile SBCL
  world         buildsbcl && build

  clean         delete all compiled object files
  mrproper      delete all downloaded source and fasl files

  slime         run the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode in a fresh Emacs
  lisp          run Lisp in the terminal

  record-dependencies   rebuild dependency information file

Starting applications:

  run APPLICATION   run this application
  run --help        show help for applications

If you do 'world' or 'buildsbcl' then SBCL will be installed in
target/ and used for future commands. If you don't run these commands
(or you remove target/) then clbuild uses the 'sbcl' in your PATH.

For configuration options (including for non-SBCL lisps), see clbuild.conf.
