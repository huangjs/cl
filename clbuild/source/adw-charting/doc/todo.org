#+OPTIONS: num:nil

* Fall 2009
** process incoming patches
   have gotten a few via email
** get it asdf-installable
* Spring 2010
** convert repo to git
** cleanup dead code
** review vecto backend, refactor with current knowledge
   when I wrote a lot of this I was obsessed with mapcar and unfamilair with loop/iterate,
   and much code can be eliminated or made much clearer with loop/iterate
** signal an error when specifying a google chart that is too big for the google service
   maybe provide a restart to use the biggest valid height/width that keeps the aspect ratio?
** pull in alexandria for common utils
   might not be needed
* Summer 2010
** look at a smarter way to pick points/labels/bounds
   - change the order in which elements are drawn and keep counters to manage visual dependencies
* Future
** move into a different place on clnet containing other ADW libraries
   We have a growing number of libraries at work that could be opened up,
   and it might be best to have an "ADW" umbrella project similar to arnesi to
   contain our many sub-projects.
