First: edit EDITME.lisp to give it the correct paths to various stuff.

Run make-desktop.sh
All of the auto-installation code is commented out, so say N.

Then, wait for it.... 

And run
sbcl --core clim-desktop.core
or ./clim-desktop

Beirc is (beirc:beirc)
Climacs is (climacs-gui:climacs :new-process t)
Closure is (closure:start)
Listener is (clim-listener:run-listener :new-process t)
Launcher is (clim-launcher::start)

Fun stuff:
Beirc and Climacs use Closure.
Climacs is now called by common-lisp:ed.
Climacs can be called on files, (climacs-gui::climacs-edit pathname)

PROBLEMS:
Everything kinda assumes threads and sbcl.
Beirc is also broken under OpenMCL.  Not my fault, I swear.
Clouseau has to be loadable with asdf.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
Contains bits from:
cl-irc
