Climacs:
Faster parser: GLR parse
more SLIME/SWINE stuff

chandler: ISTR some discussion a little while ago about modes which
need ot make sure the parse  tree is up to date, including the bits
off screen, druing certain  commands.
figuring out the protocol for that would be a great step.

that might involve something like update-syntax-between-cursors to
the protocol and doing  update-syntax for display in terms of that

splittist: more indentation, more swine, robust non-buffer panes,
documenting  commands/variables.
defcustom, compose facilities, spell checker

mac: embedding climacs into a cocoa view via beagle
splittist: paredit.

/END CLIMACS

Xof:  it would be nice to have sb-sprof integration of some form
jsnell's sb-sprof-ui is a probable starting point
