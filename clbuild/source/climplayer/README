Installation
------------

Climplayer runs under [sbcl][4] and [cmucl][5] on GNU/Linux but might
work with other Common Lisp implementations or on other
systems. Additionally it requires [mcclim][6], [the mcclim
listener][14], [split-sequence][7], [cl-ppcre][8], [wget][9],
[mplayer][1], [fileschanged][11] and either [FAM][12] or [Gamin][13].

Get the latest version either by using Luke Gorrie's [clbuild][15] or
through the darcs repository:

        darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/climplayer/darcs/climplayer/

Once [ASDF][10] can find the necessary system definitions fire up your
favorite Common lisp and type:

        (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :climplayer)

   and:

        (climplayer:climplayer)

Usage
-----

Climplayer builds its play list by searching a number of directories
you specify the first time you start the program. To make building and
updating of the playlist efficient, specify directories which contain
mostly media files instead of your home directory which probably
contains a large number of subdirectories and files that climplayer
doesn't need to be dealing with.
