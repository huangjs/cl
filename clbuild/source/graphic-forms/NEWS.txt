Release 0.8.0 of Graphic-Forms, a Common Lisp library for Windows GUI
programming, is now available. The API and feature set is still evolving,
so this is still another alpha release.

New in this release:

. Added a new macro GFW:DEFMENU2 and associated function GFW:MAKE-MENU
  to allow applications to create reusable menu factories.

. Latest CFFI is required to take advantage of built-in support for the
  stdcall calling convention.

. Integrated patch submitted by Leon van Dyk that enables dialog-only
  applications. The GFT::STANDALONE-DIALOG function demonstrates this
  feature, but NOTE that when this is invoked from SLIME, an old problem
  reappears where the dialog is not initially visible; however, the same
  demo run directly from the REPL works OK.

. Ported the library to Allegro CL 8.0.

. Upgraded to LispWorks 5.0.1 (note: 4.4.6 is no longer supported)

. Implemented GFW:STATUS-BAR which currently allow a single text field.
  Multi-part status bars, and nested widget support, will be added in a
  future release.

. Implemented GFW:PROGRESS-BAR, which provides visual progress feedback. This
  control can be configured for horizontal or vertical orientation, and can
  display a segmented or continuous indicator.

. Simplified the mechanism for specifying fixed, non-resizable windows by
  adding a new GFW:TOP-LEVEL style called :FIXED-SIZE and enhancing GFW:PACK
  to do the right thing if that style flag has been specified.

. Greatly expanded the symbols for accessing predefined colors, and now
  provide access to system color settings in a similar manner.

. Implemented a new graphics context function GFG:CLEAR that is a convenient
  way to fill a window or image with a background color.

. GFS:OBTAIN-SYSTEM-METRICS now includes version information for comctl32.dll
  and shell32.dll.

Release 0.7.0 of Graphic-Forms, a Common Lisp library for Windows GUI
programming, is now available. This is an alpha release, meaning that
the feature set and API have not yet stabilized.

Here is what's new in this release:

. Implemented cursor support. Applications can choose from the system-defined
  cursors or load them from external files. Also provided are convenience
  macros GFW:WITH-CURSOR and GFW:WITH-WAIT-CURSOR.

. Implemented a new layout manager called GFW:BORDER-LAYOUT which allows
  applications to assign children to regions around the perimeter of a
  window or the center.

. Implemented GFS:OBTAIN-SYSTEM-METRICS as a higher-level interface to the
  Win32 GetSystemMetrics() API. It returns a hash table containing slightly
  post-processed system metrics values.

. Implemented the function GFW:PROCESS-EVENTS to help applications flush
  the event queue of pending events.

. GFW:APPEND-ITEM now accepts an optional classname argument so that
  applications can use custom item classes.

. Implemented a new macro GFW:WITH-ROOT-WINDOW which manages the lifetime
  of an instance of GFW:ROOT-WINDOW for use within the macro body.

. Fixed ASDF loading problems.

Release 0.6.0 of Graphic-Forms, a Common Lisp library for Windows GUI
programming, is now available. This is an alpha release, meaning that
the feature set and API have not yet stabilized.

Here is what's new in this release:

. CFFI snapshot 060925 or later is now required if you are running
  CLISP 2.40 or later (due to a change in the argument list of
  CLISP's FFI:FOREIGN-LIBRARY-FUNCTION).

. Completely revamped the Programming Reference. DocBook/XSL is now used
  for help authoring, and the manual is delivered in HTML Help format.

. Implemented scrolling protocol and related helper objects and functions
  to facilitate scrolling functionality in applications:

  * window styles :horizontal-scrollbar and :vertical-scrollbar

  * functions to retrieve window scrollbars

  * GFW:EVENT-SCROLL function for handling low-level scrolling events

  * GFW:SCROLLING-HELPER for automatic management of a scrollable
    child panel and window scrollbars (works in combination with
    GFW:HEAP-LAYOUT)

  * integral scrolling and resizing for step sizes greater than 1

. Initial list box control functionality implemented:

  * three selection modes (none / multiple / extend)

  * list item data comprised by arbitrary application-defined data

  * application defined sorting predicates

  * querying and programmatic control of item selection states

  * customizability of vertical scrollbar mode and keyboard input

  Additional list box features are planned for a future release.

. Implemented stand-alone scrollbar and slider control types.

. Renamed functions that query the standard color, file, and font dialogs
  to make their naming scheme more consistent.

. Implemented GFW:EVENT-PRE-RESIZE function so that applications can customize
  the behavior of a window's size drag rectangle.

. Implemented GFW:EVENT-PRE-MOVE function so that applications can customize
  the behavior of a window's move drag rectangle.

. Improved GFW:HEAP-LAYOUT such that it obeys the top child's minimum and
  maximum sizes, if any such sizes are set.

. Added GFG:FONT method for querying the current font selected for a window.

. Did some housecleaning of the item-manager protocol and heavily refactored
  the implementation of item-manager base functionality.

. Implemented GFW:ENABLE-REDRAW to enable applications to temporarily
  disable (and later re-enable) drawing of widget content.

. Fixed a bug in GFW:CHECKED-P (and GFW:SELECTED-P) for checkbox and
  radio button -style buttons.

. Fixed a bug in the initialization of the paint rectangle in the WM_PAINT
  message handling method; the correct rectangle is now passed to
  GFW:EVENT-PAINT

. Fixed a bug in the SETF functions for GFW:MAXIMUM-SIZE and GFW:MINIMUM-SIZE
  for windows whereby the size value was not being set in the appropriate
  slot if there were no layout set for the window.

Release 0.5.0 of Graphic-Forms, a Common Lisp library for Windows GUI
programming, is now available. This is an alpha release, meaning that
the feature set and API have not yet stabilized.

Here is what's new in this release:

. SBCL is now supported (specifically version 0.9.15). Graphic-Forms
  includes a small patch provided to the SBCL community by
  Alastair Bridgewater to enable the stdcall calling convention for
  alien callbacks. Please see src/external-libraries/sbcl-callback-patch

. Implemented a plugin mechanism for integrating graphics libraries. This
  means that ImageMagick is now optional -- if your application can get
  by with just BMP and ICO formats, then the default plugin (which has no
  external dependencies) may be used. This feature also allows applications
  to integrate other graphics libraries of their choice.

. In addition to ImageMagick now being optional, external library
  dependencies have been further simplified. Several small libraries
  are now directly bundled with the Graphic-Forms. Cells is no longer
  used in the library proper nor in the demos (but may return at a
  later point).

. Implemented a class called icon-bundle which may be populated with
  multiple images and then used to set icon data for window frames.
  This includes the concept of there being 'large' and 'small' icon
  sizes.

. Simplified the argument lists for the event-*** generic functions.
  Provided gfw:obtain-event-time as a substitute for passing a time
  argument to every function (for which the vast majority of methods
  had no use).

. Defined the following new generic functions:

  * event-session GF so applications can participate in the
    WM_QUERYENDSESSION / WM_ENDSESSION protocol.

  * event-activate and event-deactivate GFs so applications can respond
    to window activation state changes.

  * GFs for querying undo and redo state. Implemented corresponding
    methods for edit controls.

  * GFs for configuring auto-scrolling and scrollbar visibility. Implemented
    corresponding methods for edit controls.

  * GFs representing text clipboard data convenience functionality.
    Implemented corresponding methods for edit controls.

. Made other miscellaneous improvements to flesh out edit control
  support.

. Implemented the standard color chooser dialog and associated
  convenience macro 'with-color-dialog'.

. Added the macro 'with-graphics-context' as a convenience for code that
  needs to instantiate a context outside of event-paint.

. Heavily revised internal layout manager code in preparation for
  supporting more sophisticated layouts. A new class called layout-managed
  has been created to serve as a mix-in when defining objects (not
  necessarily only windows) that have children to be sized and positioned.

. Implemented a new demo program called textedit which is essentially
  a Notepad clone. Its purpose is to show off the multi-line edit
  control and the standard Find/Replace dialog.

. Upgraded to the latest lisp-unit and changed test loading code so that
  unit-tests are no longer compiled.

. Wrote more documentation and reorganized existing content a bit.
  Added discussion of certain naming convention choices.

. Made a variety of bug fixes.

information about this release.
