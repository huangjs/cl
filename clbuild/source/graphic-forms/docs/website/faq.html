    <h5><a name="FAQ1">1. Why implement another user interface library?</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>I don't think the space of GUI development has yet been explored adequately,
     particularly where declarative and dynamic approaches are concerned. I also
     don't think Windows-based Common Lisp developers have enough options for GUI programming.
     Finally, I think more open-source code is better than less, arguments about
     balkanization and limited resources notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>The argument could be made (and I believe has been, although right now I can't
     find the link to <a href="http://ometer.com/">Havoc Pennington's</a> blog
     entry where I think I remember him doing so) that the industry doesn't need
     another GUI API; who am I to think people will adopt my API, and why should
     they be bothered to try?</p>

  <p>First of all, there always will be people willing try new things -- and they are
     great people from whom to get feedback. Secondly, there is no physical law of
     the universe saying innovation in the GUI API space is at an end, especially
     if you consider how many dynamically-typed, code-is-data libraries there are
     compared to the statically-typed, Algol-based so-called <i>popular</i> choices.
     Third, every one of the existing incumbents started with 0 fans (or 1 if you
     count the original designer). Fourth, I wanted (and still want) to provide
     Windows developers more options -- less reason to give up on Common Lisp. I'll
     spare you reasons 5, 6, and 7 since I think (and hope) you've gotten the gist.
     If not, oh well I tried.</p>

  <div class="faq_header">
    <h5><a name="FAQ2">2. Common Lisp is obscure, shouldn't we stick with popular programming languages?</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>I got interested in Common Lisp initially after reading Paul Graham's
     <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html">essays on Lisp</a>,
     then grew more serious after buying a copy of
     <i><a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a></i> by
     Peter Seibel. I have grown to appreciate Common Lisp as a superior programming
     language for the kind of development I want to do in the long-term.</p>

  <p>Compared to current popular languages and their associated frameworks,
     it's tempting to think of Common Lisp as being obscure. In reality, it has a long
     <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html">history</a>,
     and there are
     <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/carl.html">well-known</a>
     <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt">success</a>
     <a href="http://www.franz.com/success/customer_apps/animation_graphics/naughtydog.lhtml">stories</a>.
     One of the attributes of Lisp making GUI programming a real joy is the ability
     to easily define powerful domain-specific languages, such as the <code>DEFMENU</code>
     language in Graphic-Forms. I don't regret shifting my focus to Common Lisp at all.</p>

  <p>You can find more information about Common Lisp on the web
     <a href="http://www.cliki.net/">here</a>,
     <a href="http://cl-user.net/">here</a>, and
     <a href="http://common-lisp.net/">here</a>. Or just read
     <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/iflisp.html">this essay</a> and think about
     it for a while. In any case, if you're comfortable and productive using the tools
     you already have available, more power to you.</p>

  <div class="faq_header">
    <h5><a name="FAQ3">3. Why focus solely on Windows at the expense of portability?</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>This is a hard question to answer in a satisfactory manner, because the premise
     is absolutely valid: developers prefer to support multiple platforms or
     at least have the freedom to change their focus. There is quite a bit of
     well-deserved ambivalence, if not hostility, towards Windows and the
     <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">company</a> that produces it.</p>

  <p>Having worked for the company once known as <i>XVT Software, Inc.</i>
     in the early 1990's, I gained an appreciation for both the value of and the
     incredible demands imposed by software portability. There are existing
     Lisp-based GUI portability libraries, which I respect for their good
     intentions, not to mention the huge effort they require. Relatively few Lisp-based
     GUI libraries target Windows specifically, hence this is a niche I wanted to
     try to fill.</p>

  <p>The bottom line is this: I want more people to write GUI applications for
     Windows in Common Lisp, and I hope you use Graphic-Forms to do it. As for
     the ABM crowd, if you don't like Windows, then you're welcome to ignore this
     project. Don't bother flaming me about it, as I will ignore you.</p>

  <div class="faq_header">
    <h5><a name="FAQ4">4. What is the status of Graphic-Forms?</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>Graphic-Forms is in alpha and will be for the forseeable future -- a user interface
     library of this kind entails a large feature set.  The code and documentation is
     under constant development, with new features being added at a rapid pace. Public
     interfaces have not yet stabilized, thus I cannot yet commit to backwards compatibility.
     This is a project with which (I hope) early adopters can experiment.</p>

  <p>I will nevertheless point out how this project has gotten past the initial hurdle
     where other projects often die out. There are key aspects of the
     design (if not the implementation) of Graphic-Forms that I'm getting pretty happy
     with, and most of all, I've proven to my satisfaction the feasibility of building
     a user interface library in Common Lisp for Windows. I think a solid foundation
     is forming.</p>

  <p>I expect to transition to beta when the majority of features are in place and
     what remains is essentially testing -- but it's a grey area and none of us can
     predict the future with any certainty.</p>

  <div class="faq_header">
    <h5><a name="FAQ5">5. Please compare Graphic-Forms to libraries X, Y, and Z.</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>I'm generally not inclined to do so. Writing an accurate and thorough
     comparison is a lot of work, whereas I'd rather spend the time and energy
     directly on Graphic-Forms. Also, there is a risk of my making inaccurate
     statements which might result in nasty email filling my in-box that I
     could live without, and perhaps even legal troubles.</p>
  <p>Also, as far as my personal attitude regarding criticism of other people's
     work is concerned, I prefer to do so in the proper venue with more likelihood
     of such feedback resulting in improvements. See
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethic_of_reciprocity">The Golden Rule</a>.</p>

  <div class="faq_header">
    <h5><a name="FAQ6">6. How can I contribute?</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>Constructive criticism, bug reports, and patches are always appreciated and
     thoughtfully considered. Here are the main channels for participation:<br/>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/graphic-forms-devel">
           Developer mailing list</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=163034&atid=826145">
           Bug tracking system</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=163034&atid=826147">
           Patch uploads</a></li>
     </ul></p>

  <p>Bug reports should be accompanied by self-contained test cases whenever possible.
     A quick note about your environment (Windows version, CL implementation, etc)
     is also very important.

  <p>Graphic-Forms is <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~jdunrue/license.html">BSD licensed</a>.
     As project founder/lead developer, <b>I reserve the right to reject or modify patches
     as I see fit</b>. But rest assured I am grateful to receive patches and will make every
     effort to understand and preserve the intent of any contributions. Finally, for
     any patch consisting of more than 2-3 lines of code, I will include your copyright
     statement in the relevant source file(s) along with my own.</p>

  <div class="faq_header">
    <h5><a name="FAQ7">7. That's an unusual project name.</a></h5>
  </div>
  <p>I'm glad you think so! It's difficult to identify project names that are
     meaningful and relevant, yet are free of trademark concerns. The name
     Graphic-Forms is meant to be a play on words, since the library focuses
     on <b>graphic</b>al features and <b>forms</b> is a term referring to
     fragments of Lisp code.</P
