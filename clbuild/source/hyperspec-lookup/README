Description:

  hyperspec: a ANSI Common Lisp library that provides a
  reliable way of mapping symbols to URLs for both the Common Lisp
  Hyperspec and the Common Lisp Object System MetaObject Protocol.

Usage:

  Note that there is some overlap between the MOP and the Hyperspec
  and in those cases `lookup' will always return the Hyperspec result
  first.  For example:

    * (lookup "add-method")
    "http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_add_me.htm"

  but note that:

    * (mop-lookup "add-method")
    "http://www.alu.org/mop/dictionary.html#add-method"

  also succeeds.

Customization:

  You'll probably have to customize the *hyperspec-map-file* and the
  *mop-map-file* to point to local copies (note that Mop_Sym.txt is
  distributed with this library).
