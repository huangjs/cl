;;; REALIZE-MIRROR-AUX is invoked by the different REALIZE-MIRROR methods.
;;; These are invoked by the core when a sheet is GRAFTED (specifically
;;; from the sheet's NOTE-SHEET-GRAFTED method).

;;; Sheets are GRAFTED after they are adopted by a sheet that is itself
;;; grafted; see SHEET-ADOPT-CHILD :AFTER method in SHEETS.LISP

;;; It appears that when the GRAFT (automatically grafted) ADOPTS a
;;; sheet, a MIRROR is created via the NOTE-SHEET-GRAFTED method.

;;; So we can say at this point that sheets will definately be grafted,
;;; but not necessarily have a MEDIUM associated (which seems very bad
;;; to me). [aside: some sheets in McCLIM are mirrored, and NEVER have
;;; a medium associated. This violates the spec, if nothing else.]

;;; Sheets can't possibly have a mirror transformation at this point, since
;;; we're in the process of creating the mirror... if any mirror
;;; transformation exists, it must surely be +IDENTITY-TRANSFORMATION+.
;;; UPDATE: at mirror realization time, (%sheet-mirror-transformation) is
;;; ALWAYS +identity-transformation+.

;;; _SUSPECT_ we can say the same about the sheet-mirror-region; this
;;; is presumably set to some default. (%sheet-mirror-region) ALWAYS
;;; returns NIL at the point of mirror realization (which seems to not
;;; be unreasonable).

;;; When a mirror is realized, the NSView native object created is added
;;; as a child of the mirror (NSView) via the :add-subview message. This
;;; means that any PARENTS of the current sheet MUST be MIRRORED (and
;;; therefore grafted) BEFORE this sheet. This doesn't seem too
;;; unreasonable.

;;; QUERY: must a sheet be grafted in order to be mirrored?

;;; The exceptions to this are TOP-LEVEL-SHEET-PANE, for which we create
;;; a 'FRAME' (a native window). Suspect this should happen at a
;;; different part of the process, but... it doesn't. Yet. ::FIXME::

;;; Note that when the TOP-LEVEL-SHEET-PANE is realized, the sheet DOES
;;; have a FRAME associated with it (PANE-FRAME sheet). We *should*
;;; create the NSWindow native object when this frame is associated.

;;; The same 'rules' regarding mirror-transformation and mirror-region as
;;; mentioned above still apply for TOP-LEVEL-SHEET-PANEs. Note also that
;;; in CLX the realize method for these is marked as 'obsolete' so there
;;; may be a better way of mirroring them.

;;; Personally I don't think we should be invoking 'update-mirror-
;;; geometry' in the realization process. This should be implicit from the
;;; bounds of the sheet, wrt the size of the graft (screen).

;;; Realization methods (even for top level sheets) do NOT put the window
;;; up on screen; this is done elsewhere.

;;; The UNMANAGED-TOP-LEVEL-SHEET-PANE *also* requires its own window.
;;; These panes are used for popup and command menus (although I suspect
;;; this *isn't* what the spec. intends when talking about COMMAND-MENU-
;;; PANE types.

;;; For UNMANAGED-TOP-LEVEL-SHEET-PANEs, the transformation is initially
;;; +identity-transformation+, but the region is 0,0 x 100,100 (which is
;;; a default; appears not to take into account any actual size
;;; requirement)

;;; Also, for COMMAND-MENU panes, the position they are drawn is incorrect.
;;; This is (I think) because they are WINDOWS and therefore need to be
;;; positioned relative to the GRAFT; currently they are being treated as
;;; sheets (NSViews), and positioned relative to the origin of the window
;;; in which they appear. This is wrong. ::FIXME::
