(in-package :beagle)

;;; The beagle backend of McCLIM runs inside a Cocoa application. There is one
;;; port, associated with that application. There is no separate event process;
;;; the main thread of the Cocoa app is notified of events and puts them on the
;;; proper event queues using the mapping in the port object between NSViews
;;; and sheets.

frame manager. Permissable values are 'beagle::beagle-standard-frame-manager and
'beagle::beagle-aqua-frame-manager (the default).")

;;; ::FIXME:: this holds the current cursor (mouse pointer) being used...
;;; It's not implemented properly I don't think; McCLIM core should know

;;; Additionally we shove all the views we create into view-table, which is brain-
;;; damaged. This allows us to look up the appropriate mirror / medium when we're handling
;;; events, but the whole medium / mirror / sheet / NSView relationship thing needs rethinking
;;; in the long-term. (NB. this duplicates behaviour in McCLIM "PORT" type but that uses
;;; 'eq tests in the hashtables, and MACPTRs (which is what a mirror boils down to being in
;;; the end) are only ever 'eql.)

;;; I'm not sure what Duncan was getting at with that comment;
;;; mirror/sheet/NSView seems like a fine correspondence to me, unless you want
