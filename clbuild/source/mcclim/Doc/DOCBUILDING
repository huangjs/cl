Building the McCLIM documentation requires a few things:

         * SBCL
         * CL-PPCRE.
         * McCLIM.
         * ImageMagick.
         * And whatever tools are necessary to build HTML and PDF
           output from Texinfo.

Before the docs can be built, docstrings will have to be extracted
from McCLIM. This is automatically done by starting SBCL and loading
McCLIM along with a program that looks at the documentation of
exported symbols in a number of packages. Therefore, you must provide
the location of the necessary ASDs (mcclim.asd, cl-ppcre.asd and
whatever they depend on) on the command line via the SYSTEMSDIR
environment variable, the value of which must be a string that SBCL
can understand as a pathname. For example:

 $ SYSTEMSDIR="/home/hacker/.cl-systems/" make

You can also use the SBCL_SYSTEM environment variable to change which
SBCL is used. Please note that SBCL will be run without evaluating the
system-initialization-file (--no-sysinit). If this does not work for
you, edit make-tempfiles.sh

The Makefile will have to reload McCLIM from scratch every time it
regerenes the docstrings. If you are working on McCLIM, this is rather
time-consuming, so note that you can regenerate them from within the
running Lisp; look at make-docstrings.lisp.

If you're a user, you probably won't need to build the
documentation. Prebuilt versions should be (or will be) available, if
they aren't, please let us know.
