This library for reading and writing MIDI files, and for representing
MIDI events, was originally written by students of Robert Strandh at
Universit√© Bordeaux I.  It was then included in the Gsharp score
editor[1], and was also posted to the alt.music.midi and
comp.lang.lisp newsgroups[2].  Subsequently, workers at Goldsmiths
College included it in their own projects, and took over the
responsibility of distributing a copy usable by multiple projects.
