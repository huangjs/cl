Description:

	montezuma-indexfiles is software to help index a directory
	tree of files using the Montezuma Common Lisp search
	engine. It is analogous to the "IndexFiles" application which
	comes with the Lucene search engine distribution.

	Here is an example of how you can index all of the files in
	the directory starting at "/home/you/src/emacs/":

        (index-directory-tree "/home/you/src/emacs/" 
                              :index-dir "/home/you/index/")

	Here is a more verbose example of how you can index all of the
	files with a "txt" extension in the directory tree starting at
	"/home/you/src/emacs/", while merging index files every 100
	documents:

        (let ((*accept-function* #'accept-docs-by-ext)
              (*accept-ext-list* '("txt")))
          (index-directory-tree "/home/you/src/emacs/" 
                                :index-dir "/home/you/index/"
                                :merge-factor 100
                                :min-merge-docs 100))

	There is a quick way to check the resulting index using the
	aptly named "quicksearch" function:

	(quicksearch "+where +wally")
	
Known issues:

	The code isn't portable.
