Redshank - Common Lisp Editing Extensions (for Emacs)       -*- outline -*-

* Installation Instructions
See file redshank.el for setting up Redshank mode.

* External Dependencies
Redshank is developed and tested with GNU Emacs 22.2.50.1.  Patches to
ensure interoperability with other versions of GNU Emacs and XEmacs
are welcome.

The number of Elisp library dependencies is fairly small:

** Paredit 
Version 21 is required.  Download from
<http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el>.

** cl, skeleton, easymenu 
These come with GNU Emacs 22.

** SLIME
SLIME is optional, but recommended to activate all features of
Redshank.  As of this writing, the latest release of SLIME (2.0) is
very outdated, thus Redshank requires a recent CVS snapshot of SLIME.
Instructions can be found at <http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/>.

* Common Lisp
Some features require interoperation with a Common Lisp
implementation, via SLIME.  This has been tested and is known to work
with at least SBCL 1.0.19, OpenMCL 1.1-pre-070722 (DarwinX8664), and
CLISP 2.40, albeit with varying degrees of support.

The currently best supported implementation is SBCL.  Support for
other implementations is very welcome. (See file redshank.lisp for the
Lisp side support.)
