<H1>The ACL2 Books Directory</H1>
<P>
The word ``book'' has two senses to the ACL2 user.  One is the normal one: a
sequence of printed paper pages bound together between covers.  There are
such books about ACL2.  Click <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-papers.html">here</A>
for more information.
<P>
The other sense is a technical one: an ACL2 ``book'' is a file of
definitions, theorems and other commands used to extend ACL2's reasoning
abilities.  Commands add ``rules'' to ACL2's data base.  When a book is
``certified,'' ACL2 checks that all the commands in it can be successfully
processed.  A book can be ``included'' into an ACL2 session to extend the
data base.  This is the standard way users exchange useful sets of theorems.
See the online documentation topic BOOKS for details.
<P>
The standard distribution of ACL2 comes with many books.  They are stored on
this directory.  This is a guide to the available books.  We include
instructions on how to certify the books in this directory at the <A
HREF="#CertificationInstructions">end</A> of this note.
<P>
Some of the links below are to files.  Others are to directories.  When
you visit a directory, look at its <CODE>README</CODE> file.  Most of
these books were written by ACL2 users other than the authors of ACL2.
Authorship is acknowledged in the individual files.

<CODE>books/arithmetic/top-with-meta.lisp</CODE> is the most commonly used
ACL2 arithmetic book.  However, arithmetic is an extraordinarily rich

arithmetic book, let us know!

<P>
If you seek a book you suspect someone might have created but which is not
here, join the ACL2 mailing list and ask the community.
<P>
If you develop a book you think will be useful to the community, please submit
it following the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/books/index.html">instructions
for contributing books to ACL2</a>.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="CertificationInstructions">Certification Instructions</A></H2>

Many of these books are easily imagined to be of general value to ACL2 users,
while others are more specialized.  Although this subdivision is a bit
arbitrary, we refer to books in the former category as "basic" books.  By
default, the <CODE>make</CODE> process certifies only the basic books.  It may
take several hours to certify all the books, but only a couple of hours to
certify only the "basic" books.

<P>

All of the instructions below assume that you are standing in subdirectory
<CODE>books</CODE> of the ACL2 distribution.

<P>
<B>EXAMPLES:</B>
<P>

To certify the <B>basic</B> books, assuming that `<CODE>acl2</CODE>' invokes
ACL2, execute:
<PRE>
make
</PRE>
To certify <B>all</B> books, assuming that `<CODE>acl2</CODE>' invokes ACL2,
execute the following after you download <code><a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-0/distrib/acl2-sources/books/workshops.tar.gz">
workshops.tar.gz</a></code> to your <code>acl2-sources/books/</code> directory,
and then gunzip and extract it there.
<PRE>
make all-plus
</PRE>
To certify the <B>basic</B> books, assuming that `<CODE>my_acl2</CODE>' invokes
ACL2, execute:
<PRE>
make ACL2=my_acl2
</PRE>
To certify <B>all</B> books using an image with absolute pathname
<CODE>/u/bin/allegro_acl2</CODE> on a Sparc, execute the following.  Note that
pathnames of images must be absolute pathnames (except that commands observable
via the Unix path are OK).
<PRE>
make all-plus ACL2=/u/bin/allegro_acl2
