This directory was written by Robert Krug, based in part on the arithmetic/
directory but with many changes that make this potentially more useful in a
number of circumstances.

Contents:

The directory pass1 should be of no concern to the user.  The reasons
for its existence are historical rather than practical.

The book meta/top.lisp is the top-level arithmetic book to use.

The book floor-mod/floor-mod.lisp is the beginning of a library
about floor and mod.  It has not received as much attention as it
should have, but should still be useful.
