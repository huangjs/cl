The data-structures books provide definitions and rewrite rules about some of
the basic data structures frequently used in ACL2 and Common Lisp: lists,
alists, and structures.

The contents of each book are briefly documented below.

list-defuns         definitions of list functions
list-defthms        theorems about list functions
deflist             a tool for defining typed lists
list-theory         brings in all of the above

set-defuns          definitions of set functions
set-defthms         theorems about set functions
set-theory          brings in both the definitions and theorems

alist-defuns        definitions of alist functions
alist-defthms       theorems about alist functions
defalist            a tool for defining typed alists
alist-theory        brings in all of the above

number-list-defuns  definitions about lists of numbers
number-list-defthms theorems about number list functions
number-list-theory  brings on both the definitions and theorems

structures          a tool for defining typed record structures

The following books provide support for the above, but are not
themselves certified.  Users should not generally have any reason to
use these directly.
