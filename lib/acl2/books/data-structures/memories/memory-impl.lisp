; memory-impl.lisp
;
; This is an implementation file and should not be directly included in
; external work.  Use the interface file (memory.lisp) instead!
;
; In this file we are interested in defining the user-visible notion of
; memories, and the functions to load and store into them.  We want to take
; advantage of the records library in order to provide the same record book
; theorems about our memories.

; Definition of memories.  A memory is a relatively complicated structure 
; which combined several components:
;
;   mtree  - a memtree (see the included book "memtree")
;   depth  - the depth of mtree
;   size   - the logical size of this memory (0 <= size < (expt 2 depth)
;   fast   - a flag indicating if depth is a fixnum (almost always t)
;   record - an ACL2 record ("misc/records")
; 
; Here is the basic idea.  Memtrees are really pretty nice all on their own,
; but they are limited in that (1) you always have to keep track of their
; depth, (2) their size can only be a power of 2, and (3) their addresses must
; all be numeric, complicating the theorems about them.
;
; With memories, we hope to solve all of these problems.  (1) is addressed
; simply by storing the depth of the mtree, (2) is addressed by keeping a
; separate field for the memtree's size, and (3) is addressed by adding a
; standard record which will be used (logically) to store any non-address
; fields.
;
; Our ultimate goal is to provide, for memories, the exact same theorems that
; the records book provides for records.  In other words, we want memories to
; be no more difficult to reason about than records, while still providing high
; efficiency through the use of memtrees.

; We now begin implementing the trick developed by Rob Sumners and Matt
; Kaufmann in their records book.  The 2002 Workshop paper, "Efficient
; Rewriting of Operations on Finite Structures in ACL2" is useful for
; understanding what is going on.  In fact, at the beginning of Section 4, they
; give a multi-step process for removing hyptheses:
;
;  (1) determine a normal form for the data structure such that "equivalent"
;  structures are equal. 
;
;  (2) define the desired operations assuming well formed data structures (we
;  already did this too, our load and store operations)
;
;  (3) prove the desired theorems about the operations, assuming well-formed
;  data structures.  This leads to equal-based theorems with some hypotheses
;  about the normalized or well-formed objects.
;
;  (4) define an invertible mapping from ACL2 objects into well-formed objects
;
;  (5) define "translated" versions from the "nice" operations from (2) using
;  the mapping and inverse to translate ACL2 objects into well formed objects
;  and back.
;
;  (6) prove the desired properties about the "translated" operations removing
;  the well-formed hypotheses.
;
; Below, we begin work on (4), that is, we are interested in defining an
; invertible mapping between ACL2 objects and memories.  We define a bad memory
; as anything that is not a memory, or any memory whose depth and size are zero
; and whose mtree is also a bad memory.  These are our equivalent of Sumners
; and Kaufmann's "ifrp" (ill formed record) objects.  We will then provide
; to-mem and from-mem mappings.
