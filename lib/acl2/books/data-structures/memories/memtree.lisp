; Definition of memory trees.  Our memory trees are laid out so that they have
; some fixed depth, and the actual data is at the tips of the tree.  Naturally,
; each tree can hold 2^{depth} elements.  These are an internal structure not
; meant for outside use.  
;
; We require that memory trees are "canonical" in the sense that they take as
; little space as possible.  More formally, in a memtree all nil values must be
; joined as closely as possible to the root of the tree.  For example, we would
; say that nil is a memtree, but (nil . nil) is not because it can be
; represented more concisely using just nil.  We provide an actual definition

; Definition of memory tree loading operations.  
;
; We consider there to be two ways for an address space to be laid out using
; binary trees.  In an "MSB" style tree, the most significant bit of the
; address is used at each step in order to get to determine which way to go.
; This has the advantage that memory is laid out in the "most natural" fashion
; -- i.e., 0 is the caaaaaaaaaaaa....aaaar of the tree, and the maximum element
; is the cdddddddd....dddddr of the tree.
;
; In the perhaps less natural "LSB" style, the least significant bit of the
; address is used at each step in order to determine which way to go.  This
; gives you a really strange memory, where e.g., all the odd addresses are on
; the right hand side and all the even addresses are on the left, and so forth
; down the tree.  However, the advantage is that load and store are very easy
; to write, because you can simply floor and mod the address by 2 at each step
; (or use the equivalent bit-test and shift operations) to find your address.
;
; One potential disadvantage of the LSB approach is that it is not possible to
; create "very efficient traversals" of the memory space.  But we really don't
; think this is a problem.  For example, we expect that a user would simply
; call "store" on successive addresses to zero out a block of memory, or would
; call "load" on successive addresses to read a block.  The operation will, of
; course, be slower than what is possible on an MSB implementation, but really
; that's the level of abstraction that we are providing, and it's the level of
; abstraction that we expect users to utilize.  In the future, we might want to
; consider revisiting this decision.

; Here is our generic load function.  It is simple and easy to reason about,

; mtree is nil, we would immediately return nil.  We choose NOT to do this
; because it would add a nil test on each iteration of the loop, and we think
; that it is unlikely that someone will be frequently loading memory which is
; uninitialized.

; We now provide a store function.  I think this definition is pretty standard
; following from the definition of load.  
;
; One interesting aspect is that we require that our element is non-nil.  This
; is because we would really like to keep our trees in a canonical form, where
; "nil" elements are not even stored, and paths to them are not created.  But,
; this function would not preserve this property if we gave it "nil" to store. 
; For example, (_memtree-store 0 nil nil 2) = ((nil)) instead of nil, violating
; our notion of canonicality.  Indeed, this creates problems when we try to 
; prove properties of the form (store addr (load addr mem) mem) = mem.
;
; To address this, we actually provide a separate function below,
; _memtree-store-nil, for the explicit purpose of storing nils into the tree
; and handling the canonicalization.  This lets us avoid all canonicalization
; overhead on calls of _memtree-store for non-nil elements.

;;; Fixing Theorems

; We now provide a litany of theorems which show that our functions behave as
; if their arguments were coerced using our fixing functions.  Using this
; technique, along with our admittedly bizarre definitions above, we are able
; to provide essentially hypothesis-free rewrite rules for our m operations.
;
; This is the same technique used in my ordered sets book in order to enforce
; the non-sets convention, and you can think of these as "a poor man's
; congruence rules".  Take for example _memtree-load-fix-a below, which 
; says that the following:
;
; (defthm _memtree-load-fix-addr
;   (equal (_memtree-load (_address-fix a n) m n)
;          (_memtree-load a m n)))
;
; You could imagine that we had instead written something like this:
;
; (defthm _memtree-load-fix-addr-cong
;   (implies (_address-equal a b)
;            (equal (_memtree-load a m n)
;                   (_memtree-load b m n)))
;   :rule-classes :congruence)
;
; Where _address-equal is some ficticious function that checks if two _addresses
; are equal after fixing them.  Of course, we cannot actually introduce such a
; function, at least not as an equivalence relation, because in order to fix
; the _addresses we have to know how many bits they comprise.  In other words,
; _address-equal would need to be a three-input function of a, b, and n.  But
; ACL2 only permits two-input functions to be equivalence relations.
