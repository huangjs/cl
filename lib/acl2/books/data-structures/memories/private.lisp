; private.lisp
;
; This file provides the "private" macro, which is used in memory.lisp to
; provide auxilliary/implementation functions that a user should not be allowed
; to work with directly.  The macro is generic and may be of use to the authors
; of other libraries.

(defdoc private
  ":Doc-Section private
  redundantly define, then serverely restrict the usage of some function~/
  ~bv[]
  Example:
     (private foo (x y) 
        (if (atom x) 
            ...))
  ~ev[]
  ~c[private] is a macro which may be useful for authors of libraries, or
  to users who want to enforce severe discipline upon themselves.~/

  The macro is similar to defund (~l[defund]) in that it first introduces
  a defun and then immediately disables its definition.  However, ~c[private]
  goes further -- it also disables the resulting type-prescription rule and 
  sets up theory invariants that prohibit the user from ever enabling the 
  definition or the type prescription.

  Why would we want such a thing?  A nice way to develop libraries is to use
  redundant definitions (~l[set-enforce-redundancy]) in an interface file, 
  so that users never even see the local lemmas and so forth that you used
  to get the proofs to go through.  This gives you the freedom to change 
  and remove those definitions at will.

  Unfortunately, you cannot do the same for functions, because ACL2 needs
  the functions available in the interface book if they are ever used.  With
  ~c[private], you can identify functions that you want to keep control over
  and that the user should either (1) not be using at all, or (2) only be
  reasoning about using the theorems your have provided.

  To use private, simply copy your ~c[(defun foo ...)] form into your interface
  file, then replace ~c[defun] with ~c[private].")
