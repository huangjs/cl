(in-package "ACL2")

; 
; This theory includes functions which treat lists as sets. 
; In the theory of lists and the theory of alists, we 
; provide three versions of each function based on three different
; notions of equality: EQL, EQ and EQUAL. In this theory, however,
; we provide only the EQUAL version. The main reason for this is 
; mundane: Many of the function names (e.g. UNION and INTERSECTION)
; are not defined in ACL2, but are blocked from our use because they're 
; in the Common Lisp package.
