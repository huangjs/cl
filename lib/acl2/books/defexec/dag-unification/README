This directory contains ACL2 books for the algorithm described in the paper
"Reconciling Efficient Execution in an Automated Reasoning Environment".  The
ACL2 2004 workshop contains a contribution with an updated and improved
version (of quadratic time complexity) of that algorithm.  You can find that
work by downloading and and extracting the workshops tarball, in directory
workshops/2004/ruiz-et-al/.
