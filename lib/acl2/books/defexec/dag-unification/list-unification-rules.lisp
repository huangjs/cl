;;; ============================================================================

;;; In this book we specify a set of transformation rules acting on
;;; systems of equations,. This transformation rules, due to Martelli
;;; and Montanari, applied non--deterministically, can be used to obtain
;;; most general solutions of system of equations; that is, solutions of
;;; systems of equations that subsume every other solution (whenever
;;; they exist).

;;; In this book we specify a set of transformation rules acting on
;;; systems of equations,. This transformation rules, due to Martelli
;;; and Montanari, applied non--deterministically, can be used to obtain
;;; most general solutions of system of equations; that is, solutions of
;;; systems of equations that subsume every other solution (whenever
;;; they exist).

;;; In this book we consider terms, equations and systems of equations
;;; represented as lists, in prefix notation. The concepts and results
;;; needed about first--order terms and substitutions are taken from the
;;; following books:

;;; *) 
;;;   {\tt basic.lisp}: some basic results about lists, association
;;;   lists, etc. 
;;; *) 
;;;   {\tt terms.lisp}: basic concepts about terms and substitutions.
;;; *)
;;;   {\tt matching.lisp}: a pattern for a rule--based matching
;;;   algorithm. 
;;; *) 
;;;   {\tt subsumption.lisp}: the subsumption relation between terms.  
;;; *)
;;;  {\tt subsumption-subst.lisp}: the subsumption relation between
;;;  substitutions. 
;;; -)

;;; A substitution $\sigma$ is a {\em solution} of an equation $t_1 =
;;; t_2$ if $\sigma(t_1)=\sigma(t_2)$, and is a solution of a system of
;;; equations $S$ if it is a solution of every member of $S$.  A solution of
;;; $S$ is a {\em most general solution
;;; (mgs)} if it subsumes every other solution of $S$.

;;; The relation we are going to formalize in this book is usually noted
;;; as $\Rightarrow_u$, and defined by the following set of
;;; transformation rules, acting of pair of systems of equations. The
;;; first system contains the equations to be solved and the second
;;; system contains the solution partially computed. Here $\bot$
;;; represents failure.

;;; $$\begin{array}{lll}
;;; \mbox{{\bf Delete}:} & \{t= t\}\cup R;U & \Rightarrow_u R;U \\
;;; \mbox{{\bf Check}:} & \{x= t\}\cup R;U & \Rightarrow_u \bot\\
;;;  & &\mbox{{\small if $x\in var(t)$ and $x\not=t$}}\\
;;; \mbox{{\bf Eliminate}:} & \{x= t\}\cup R;U & \Rightarrow_u
;;; \theta(R); \{x= t\}\cup \theta(U) \\ 
;;;  & &\mbox{{\small if $x\in X$, $x\notin var(t)$ and
;;;  $\theta=\{x\mapsto t\}$}}\\
;;; \mbox{{\bf Decompose}:} & \{f(s_1,\ldots,s_n)=
;;;        f(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\}\cup R;U & \Rightarrow_u \{s_1=
;;; t_1,\ldots,s_n= t_n\}\cup R;U\\
;;; \mbox{{\bf Clash }:} & \{f(s_1,\ldots,s_n)=
;;;        g(t_1,\ldots,t_m)\}\cup R;U & \Rightarrow_s \bot \mbox{, {\small
;;; if $n\not= m$ or $f\not= g$}}\\
;;; \mbox{{\bf Orient}:} & \{t= x\}\cup R;U & \Rightarrow_u \{x= t\}\cup R;U \\
;;;  & &\mbox{{\small if $x\in X$, $t\notin X$}}\\
;;; \end{array}$$ 

;;; To obtain a most general solution of a system of equations $S$ (or
;;; detect its unsolvability), we can apply this rules
;;; non--deterministically, starting in the pair of systems
;;; $S;\emptyset$, until $\bot$ is obtained or a pair of systems
;;; $\emptyset;\sigma$ is obtained. In the first case, the system $S$ is
;;; unsolvable. In the second case $\sigma$ is most general solution of
;;; $S$. 

;;; In this book we formalize in ACL2 this result. Note that we are not
;;; going to define an {\em algorithm} to apply the rules. We only
;;; describe the formal properties of application of sequences of the
;;; rules of transformations. From these properties it is easy to
;;; conclude that every algorithm that applies the rules until a
;;; solution or failure is obtained, is an algorithm that computes most
;;; general solutions.   

;;; So in this book:

;;; *) 
;;;   Definition of the relation $\Rightarrow_u$. We represent the
;;;   relation $\Rightarrow_u$ as a reduction relation. That is, we
;;;   consider a set of {\em operators} that can be applied to a set of
;;;   objects ({\em pairs of systems of equations}). To specify this
;;;   reduction relation we define the {\em applicability test} of the
;;;   operators and the {\em one--reduction step} (the result of
;;;   applying an operator to an object). See \cite{amai-jruiz} for more
;;;   details about the formalization of abstract reductions.
;;; *) 
;;;   The transformation relation preserves the set of solutions and
;;;   idempotency of the second system (under certain conditions).     
;;; *) 
;;;   The transformation relation is terminating.
;;; *)
;;;   A finite sequence of transformation steps (until there is no
;;;   applicable rule), ends with a most general solution of the
;;;   original system, or failure, if there is no solution. 
;;; -)

;;;
;;; 1) Definition of $\Rightarrow_u$ as a reduction relation
;;;
;;; ============================================================================

;;; Our goal in this section is to define the transformation relation of
;;; Martelli and Montanari. We consider that every transformation rule
;;; can be represented as an {\em operator}, indicating the equation to
;;; be transformed and the specific transformation to be performed. With
;;; this idea, the transformation relation can be defined by means of
;;; two ACL2 functions. A function {\tt unif-legal-s}, checking if it is
;;; {\em legal} to apply a given operator to a pair of systems of
;;; equations. And a second function {\tt unif-reduce-one-step-s} that
;;; computes the result of applying a given (legal) operator to a pair
;;; of systems of equations. 

;;; Pairs of systems of equations will be represented as lists of the
;;; form {\tt (S sol)}, where {\tt S} is a system of equations and {\tt
;;; sol} is a substitution. Failure will be represented as {\tt
;;; nil}. See {\tt terms.lisp} for a description of how we represent
;;; systems and substitutions.

;;; Operators are represented by lists of two elements: the name of the
;;; rule to be applied and a natural number indicating the equation of
;;; the first system (the system of equations to be solved) that will be
;;; considered. That is, we have seven types of operators:

;;; 1)
;;; {\tt (delete $N$)}: delete  equation $N$.
;;; 2)
;;; {\tt (decompose $N$)}: decompose equation $N$.
;;; 3)
;;; {\tt (orient $N$)}: orient equation $N$.
;;; 4)
;;; {\tt (eliminate $N$)}: eliminate equation N.
;;; 5)
;;; {\tt (clash1 $N$)}: clash for different top function symbol
;;; (equation $N$).
;;; 6)
;;; {\tt (clash2 $N$)}: clash for different number of arguments
;;; (equation $N$).
;;; 7)
;;; {\tt (occur-check $N$)}: detect occur-check (equation $N$).
;;; -)

;;; Definition of the function {\tt unif-legal-s} (the applicability
;;; test). Note the auxiliary functions for every type of operator.

;;; Note that the above four properties provide a form to compute most
;;; general solutions of systems of equations: apply transformations
;;; (starting in $S;\emptyset$) until $\emptyset;\sigma$ or failure is
;;; obtained. Then the system $S$ is solvable if and only if failure is
;;; not obtained and in that case $\sigma$ is a most general idempotent
;;; solution of $S$. Thus, to verify a given unification algorithm, we
;;; simply has to show that the result obtained is the result obtained
;;; by a sequence of legal operators.
