;;; ============================================================================

;;; In this book ({\tt terms-as-dag.lisp}), we define a function to
;;; store first--order terms (respresented in standard list/prefix
;;; notation) as directed acyclic graphs (dags), with shared
;;; variables. This function is essential (it is the first step) in the
;;; design of a unification algorithm using a dag representation.

;;; The following function {\tt term-as-dag-l} (with its main auxiliary
;;; function {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l}) receives as input a first--order
;;; term and a graph and returns a graph that stores the input terms
;;; (following the conventions explained in the book {\tt
;;; dags.lisp}). Note that the result is a graph such that the term
;;; pointed by the index @0@ is the input term:



(defun term-as-dag-aux-l (flg term g h variables)
  (if flg
      (if (variable-p term)
	  (let* ((bound (assoc term variables))
		 (g (update-dagi-l h (if bound (cdr bound) (cons term t)) g))
		 (new-variables (if bound variables (acons term h variables))))
	    (mv g (1+ h) nil new-variables))
	(mv-let (g h1 hsl var1)
		(term-as-dag-aux-l nil (cdr term) g (1+ h) variables)
		(let* ((g (update-dagi-l h (cons (car term) hsl) g)))
		  (mv g h1 nil var1))))
    (if (endp term)
	(mv g h term variables)
      (mv-let (g hcar ign varcar)
	      (term-as-dag-aux-l t (car term) g h variables)
	      (declare (ignore ign))
	      (mv-let (g hcdr hsl varcdr)
		      (term-as-dag-aux-l nil (cdr term) g hcar varcar)
		      (mv g hcdr (cons h hsl) varcdr))))))

(defun term-as-dag-l (term g)
  (mv-let (g h hs var)
	  (term-as-dag-aux-l t term g 0 nil)
	  (declare (ignore h hs var))
	  g))

;;; Example:

; ACL2 !>(term-as-dag-l
;            '(f (h x) y (k (g (k y) (k x z))))
;	       '(nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil)) 
; ((F 1 3 4) (H 2) (X . T)
;            (Y . T) 
;            (K 5) (G 6 8) (K 7) 3 (K 9 10) 2 (Z . T))

		  
;;; The main auxiliary function {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l} is defined
;;; recursively in the structure of the term stored. The flag @flg@
;;; indicates if @term@ is considered to be a term or a list of terms,
;;; as usual. The argument @h@ is an index in the graph @g@; from this index
;;; on, the term is going to be stored in the graph. Since the term is
;;; stored with shared variables, the argument @variables@ stored a
;;; association list, associating variables previously stored with the
;;; corresponding index of the node where the variable is already stored
;;; in the graph. 

;;; This function returns a multivalue with four values. The first one
;;; is the new graph obtained, the second is the first available index
;;; after the proccess, the third (only makes sense for the case of
;;; lists of terms) is the list of initial indices where each of the
;;; terms of the list have been stored, and the fourth is the new
;;; association list of variables to indices, extending the input
;;; association list. 

;;; Our goal in this book is to verify this function, showing that it
;;; sores a term in the conditions required by the rules of
;;; transformation of a unification algorithm acting on term dags (see
;;; {\tt dag\--unification\--rules\-.lisp}. That is, we prove the
;;; following theorems (the predicate {\tt empty-graph-p} describes
;;; graphs with @nil@ in all its positions):  

; (defthm term-as-dag-l-term-graph-p
;   (implies (and (empty-graph-p g) (term-p term))
;	     (term-graph-p (term-as-dag-l term g))))



; (defthm term-as-dag-l-dag-p
;   (implies (and (empty-graph-p g) (term-p term))
; 	     (dag-p (term-as-dag-l term g))))


; (defthm term-as-dag-l-stores-term
;   (implies (and (empty-graph-p g) (term-p term))
; 	     (equal (dag-as-term-l t 0 (term-as-dag-l term g))
;		    term)))
 

; (defthm term-as-dag-l-no-duplicatesp-variables
;    (implies (and (empty-graph-p g) (term-p term))
; 	      (no-duplicatesp
; 	         (list-of-term-dag-variables (term-as-dag-l term g))))


;;; These theorems ensure that we can use the function @term-as-dag@ to
;;; store well--formed unification problems (see the book {\tt
;;; dag-unification-rules.lisp}). In fact, in the last section of this
;;; book, we define and verify a function that (using the above function
;;; {\tt term-as-dag-l}) stores a given unification problem as directed
;;; acyclicic graph. 

;;; Finally, note that for the moment we are not talking about
;;; single--threaded objects. But later (book {\tt
;;; dag-unification-st.lisp}), we will use the properties of
;;; these functions to verify an analogue functions defined using stobjs
;;; (that is, the graph obtained will be destructively updated). 


;;; The following books are used, and contain information that is
;;; relevant to understand the contents of this book:

;;; *) 
;;;  The book {\tt dag-unification-rules} describes the rules of
;;;  transformation of unification, done with a dag representation of
;;;  terms. It includes the book {\tt dags.lisp}, where it is described
;;;  how term graphs are represented and the meaning of the information
;;;  stored in the nodes 
;;; -)


;;; ============================================================================
;;;
;;; 1) The proof strategy 
;;;
;;; ============================================================================

;;; Note that verifying the function @term-as-dag-l@ may be difficult,
;;; for several reasons:

;;; *) 
;;;   We use an association list to avoid duplication of variables.
;;; *) 
;;;   The node corresponding to a function symbol is updated {\em after}
;;;   the list of its arguments have been stored.
;;; *) 
;;;   To store a list of terms, the @cdr@ of the list is stored having
;;;   as input the graph obtained after storing the @car@ of the list.  
;;; *) 
;;;   We must ensure that the graph stored is a directed acyclic graph
;;;   (as defined by @dag-p@). In particular this property has to be
;;;   held in every stage of the proccess (because we need to use
;;;   induction hypothesis in the proof of the theorems).
;;; -)

;;; We tried to verify the functions directly and it turned (not very
;;; surprisingly) very difficult. So we explain now the approach we
;;; followed. The main idea is to employ some kind of compositional
;;; reasoning, in order to consider the difficult issues of the proofs
;;; separately. In particular, we reason about "shared variables" and
;;; the proccess of "storing the term", separately. 

;;; For that purpose, we define a version of {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l},
;;; called {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l-ns}, storing terms (or list of terms)
;;; but without the burden of getting shared variables. Note that we do
;;; not need in this case the association list of variables to indices:


(local
 (defun term-as-dag-aux-l-ns (flg term g h)
   (if flg
       (if (variable-p term)
	   (let ((g (update-dagi-l h (cons term t) g)))
	     (mv g (1+ h) nil))
	 (mv-let (g h1 hsl)
		 (term-as-dag-aux-l-ns nil (cdr term) g (1+ h))
		 (let* ((g (update-dagi-l h (cons (car term) hsl) g)))
		   (mv g h1 nil))))
     (if (endp term)
	 (mv g h term)
       (mv-let (g hcar ign)
	       (term-as-dag-aux-l-ns t (car term) g h)
	       (declare (ignore ign))
	       (mv-let (g hcdr hsl)
		       (term-as-dag-aux-l-ns nil (cdr term) g hcar)
		       (mv g hcdr (cons h hsl))))))))


;;; We also define a function that makes variables to be shared in a
;;; given graph. More precisely, the following function {\tt
;;; make\--shared\--variables} receives as input a graph, an association
;;; list (associating variables to indices pointing where they appear
;;; for the first time in the graph) and a pair of indices (indicating a
;;; range), and returns a multivalue with a graph where all the
;;; variables in the range of indices are shared and a new computed
;;; association list. Note that during the proccess, if a variable node
;;; is found and the variable is bound in the associaton list to an
;;; index, then the node is updated to that index. If the variable node
;;; is not bound in the association list, then the node is not updated,
;;; but the association list is extended, binding the new variable to
;;; the current index. 


(local
 (defun make-shared-variables (h1 h2 g variables)
   (declare (xargs :measure (nfix (- h2 h1))))
   (cond ((zp (- h2 h1))
	  (mv g variables))
	 ((term-dag-variable-p h1 g)
	  (let ((bound (assoc (term-dag-symbol h1 g) variables)))
	    (if bound
		(let ((g (update-nth h1 (cdr bound) g)))
		  (make-shared-variables (1+ h1) h2 g variables))
	      (make-shared-variables
	       (1+ h1) h2 g (acons (term-dag-symbol h1 g) h1
				   variables)))))
	 (t (make-shared-variables (1+ h1) h2 g variables)))))
 

;;; Our strategy is as follows:

;;; *) 
;;;  Verify the properties of {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l-ns}, showing that
;;;  stores the input term as a directed acyclic graph. 
;;; *) 
;;;  Show that {\tt make-shared-variables} preserves those properties. 
;;; *) 
;;;  Prove that the composition of {\tt make-shared-variables} and {\tt
;;;  term-as-dag-aux-l-ns} is equal to {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l} 
;;; *) 
;;;  Combine all the above results to prove the intended properties of
;;;  {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l}. As a particular case, the properties of
;;;  {\tt term-as-dag-l}.  
;;; -)

;;; There is an exception to this strategy: when we prove the {\tt
;;; term-graph-p} property of the graph obtained by {\tt
;;; term-as-dag-l} (theorem {\tt term-as-dag-l-term-graph-p} above),
;;; we will reason directly with the definition of the function {\tt
;;; term-as-dag-l}.  

(local (in-theory (disable assoc-val)))  


;;; ============================================================================
;;;
;;; 2) Some properties related to {\tt dag-p}
;;;
;;; ============================================================================

;;; One of the main drawbacks in the proof effort described in this book
;;; is the proof that the graphs obtained are acyclic, as defined by the
;;; function @dag-p@ (see {\tt dags.lisp}). In this section we define
;;; some conditions on graphs stronger than the @dag-p@ condition. 


;;; -----------------------------------
;;;
;;; 2.1) The property {\tt init-term-dag-p}
;;;
;;; -----------------------------------

;;; The property @init-term-dag-p@ defined below describes a particular
;;; type of directed acyclicic graphs: those obtained storing terms
;;; using the function @term-as-dag-l@. 

;;; Note the style of the definition: we define  {\em a property of
;;; nodes} ({\tt property\--element\--init\--term\--dag-p} in this
;;; case). Then we define a function ({\tt init\--term\--dag-p\--aux} in
;;; this case) checking if that property holds in a list of given
;;; nodes. Finally we define the function {\tt init\--term\--dag-p}
;;; checking the property in the list off all the nodes of a graph.  

;;; A graph has the property {\tt init-term-dag-p} if every node is
;;; @nil@, or a compound node such that its arguments are bigger
;;; indices, or a variable node, or an "is" node pointing to a previous
;;; variable node:

(local
 (defun smaller-than-list (h l)
   (if (endp l)
       t
     (and (< h (car l))
	  (smaller-than-list h (cdr l))))))

(local
 (defun property-element-init-term-dag-p (h node g)
   (or (and (natp node) (< node h) (term-dag-variable-p node g)) 
       (equal node nil)
       (and (consp node)
	    (variable-p (car node)) (equal (cdr node) t))
       (and (consp node)
	    (nat-true-listp (cdr node))
	    (smaller-than-list h (cdr node))))))

(local
 (defun init-term-dag-p-aux (hs g)
   (if (endp hs)
       t
     (and (property-element-init-term-dag-p (car hs) (nth (car hs) g) g)
	  (init-term-dag-p-aux (cdr hs) g)))))


(defun list-from-to (n m)
  (declare (xargs :measure (nfix (- m n))
		  :guard (and (natp n) (natp m) (<= n m))))
  (if (zp (- m n))
      nil
    (cons n (list-from-to (1+ n) m))))



;;; First, some properties about the function {\tt list-from-to}:

(local
 (defthm list-from-to-main-property
   (implies (and (natp n) (natp m))
	    (iff (member x (list-from-to n m))
		 (and (natp x) (<= n x) (< x m))))))


(local
 (defun nat-listp (l)
   (if (endp l)
       t
     (and (natp (car l))
	  (nat-listp (cdr l))))))
 

(local
 (defthm list-from-to-nat-listp
   (implies (and (natp h1) (natp h2))
	    (nat-listp (list-from-to h1 h2)))))


(local
 (defthm append-list-from-to
   (implies (and (natp h1) (natp h2) (natp h3)
		 (<= h1 h2) (<= h2 h3))
	    (equal (append (list-from-to h1 h2)
			   (list-from-to h2 h3))
		   (list-from-to h1 h3)))))


(local
 (defun init-term-dag-p (g)
   (init-term-dag-p-aux (list-from-to 0 (len g)) g)))
 


;;; -----------------------------------
;;;
;;; 2.2) The property {\tt tree-p}
;;;
;;; -----------------------------------

;;; A particular case of {\tt init\--term\--dag\--p} is the property
;;; {\tt tree-p}. In this case we do not allow "is" nodes. This kind iof
;;; graphs are the graphs built by the function {\tt
;;; term-as-dag-aux-l-ns}:

(local
 (defun property-element-tree-p (h node)
   (or (equal node nil)
       (and (consp node)
	    (variable-p (car node)) (equal (cdr node) t))
       (and (consp node)
	    (nat-true-listp (cdr node))
	    (smaller-than-list h (cdr node))))))



(local  
 (defun tree-p-aux (hs g)
   (if (endp hs)
       t
     (and (property-element-tree-p (car hs) (nth (car hs) g))
	  (tree-p-aux (cdr hs) g)))))
 
(local
 (defun tree-p (g)
   (tree-p-aux (list-from-to 0 (len g)) g)))
 



;;; -----------------------------------
;;;
;;; 2.2) The property {\tt init-term-dag-p} implies {\tt dag-p} 
;;;
;;; -----------------------------------

;;; Due to the main properties of {\tt dag-p} (see {\tt dags.lisp}) we
;;; only has to show that every path in graph verifying {\tt
;;; init-term-dag-p} has no duplicates nodes. But this is true because
;;; the paths in this case are strictly increasing except (possibly) the
;;; last node (and in that case, this last node is a variable node and
;;; obvioulsy it has to be the first time it appears in a path):

;;; We first prove some properties about {\tt init-term-dag-p} before
;;; disabling the function:

;;; 4.2) Subgraphs and coincidence in subgraphs.
;;;
;;; -----------------------------------

;;; When proving (by induction on the structure of terms) the main
;;; theorem of this section, one of the induction case is a to prove the
;;; result for non--empty list of terms, having as induction hypothesis
;;; the result for the first term and the result for the list of the
;;; rest of terms. To be able to use the first hypothesis, we must show
;;; that the first term after completing the process it is stored in the
;;; same way as before storing the rest of the terms. And this is true
;;; because every time a subterm is stored in the graph, it is stored in
;;; a subgraph, and subgraphs are "closed" w.r.t. the terms
;;; stored. We prove this in this subsection.


;;; Let us first define the notion of {\em subgraph}. The following
;;; function checks that that all the neighbors (in a graph @g@) of a
;;; list of nodes @hs1@ are a subset of the list of nodes @hs2@:

(local
 (defun subsetp-all-neighbors (hs1 hs2 g)
   (if (endp hs1)
       t
     (and (subsetp (neighbors (car hs1) g) hs2)
	  (subsetp-all-neighbors (cdr hs1) hs2 g)))))

;;; A list of nodes @hs@ is a subgraph of a graph @g@ if all the
;;; neighbors of the nodes of the list are in the same list.   

(local
 (defun subgraph-p (hs g)
   (subsetp-all-neighbors hs hs g)))

;;; The following function define the notion of {\em coincidence} in a
;;; set of indices of two given graphs.
 
(local

       t

	  (graph-coincide (cdr hs) g1 g2)))))
 

;;; Now we show that if we have two directed acyclic graphs such that a
;;; given set of indices form a subgraph and coincide in both subgraphs,
;;; then the function @dag-as-term-l@ behaves in the same way in both

;;; with the graph obtained after succesively storing the first and then
;;; the second.

;;; In this way, we can use the result in the previous subsection to
;;; prove two theorems that will allow us to use the induction
;;; hypothesis in the proof of the main theorem in this section.

;;; First, we show the result about coincidence of graphs obtained after

;;; ============================================================================

;;; Our intention in this section is to prove a theorem that will allow

;;; the graph obtained by {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l-ns} we obtain a graph
;;; thta verifies the {\tt init-term-dag-p} property and, consequently,
;;; the {\tt dag-p} property. Since we have proved in section 3 that the
;;; graph obtained by {\tt term-as-dag-aux-l-ns} verifies {\tt tree-p}
;;; then the following theorem will be our final goal in this section:


;  (defthm init-term-dag-p-make-shared-variables
;    (implies (and (natp h1) (natp h2) (<= h1 h2) (<= h2 (len g))
;		  (tree-p g) (variables-well-stored-p h1 g variables))

;;; This theorem will be a particular case of a more general theorem
;;; that can be proved by induction. The function {\tt
;;; variables-well-stored-p} defines some kind of "invariant" during the
;;; proccess of making variables shared; it defines how the association
;;; list computed by {\tt make-shared-variables} is related to the "piece"

;;; of "invariant" during the proccess of making variables shared; it
;;; defines how the association list computed by {\tt

;;; processed. Intuitively, it establishes that the association list
;;; @variables@ binds the variable nodes of the graph @g@ to the index
;;; of the nodes of the graph where they appear, for all the nodes with
;;; index less than @h@. That is, if we have made variables shared in
;;; @g@ until index @h-1@ then {\tt ((variables-well-stored-p h g
;;; variables)} where @vraibles@ is the association list computed {\tt
;;; make-shared-variables} up to that moment.

;    (no-duplicatesp
;     (list-of-term-dag-variables

;;; And also we show that making variables to be shared preserves the

;;; -----------------------------------


;;; Now we prove that {\tt empty-graph-p} implies {\tt term-graph-p}
;;; (see the definition of {\tt term\--graph\--p} in the book {\tt
;;; dag-unification-rules}. Note the different styles in both
;;; definitions. The second one is defined recursively in the graph, and
;;; the first one is defined in terms of its indices. The implication
;;; can be proved by a general procedure. So we stablish the general
;;; reasoning and then obtain by functional instantiation the required
;;; property in this case.


;;; We assume the existence of a property @p-wit@ verified by all the
;;; elements (obtained with @nth@) of a list @l-wit@:

;;; We can show that, in this case, all the elements of the list (l-wit)
;;; verify p-wit, an this can be expresed in two ways (recursively on

;;; 11) Building unification problems
;;;
;;; ============================================================================

;;; The function {\tt terms-as-dag-l} will be our main auxiliary
;;; function for building (dag) unification problems. Recall that a
;;; unification problem (see {\tt dags.lisp}) is determined by an
;;; indices system, an indices substitution and a well--formed directed
;;; acyclic graph. Initially, the indices substitution is empty. We now
;;; describe how we build the graph and the indices system for a
;;; unification problem of the form $\{t_1=t_2\}$: 

;;; This function computes the graph. Note that the list that represents
;;; the graph is previously resized after computing how many nodes are
;;; needed. Also note that the term {\tt (equ t1 t2)} is stored in the
;;; graph using {\tt term-as-dag-l}:

(defun unif-two-terms-problem-l (t1 t2 g)
  (let* ((size (+ (length-term t t1) (length-term t t2) 1)) 
	 (g (resize-list g size nil)))
    (term-as-dag-l (list 'equ t1 t2) g)))

;;; The initial indices system is taken from the argument list of the
;;; first node:

(defun initial-to-be-solved-l (g)
  (let ((args-0 (cdr (dagi-l 0 g))))
    (list (cons (first args-0)
		(second args-0)))))

;;; Following the results proved in the book {\tt
;;; dag-unification-rules}, our goal is to prove the following: 

; If (empty-graph-p g)
; let* g-t1-t2     =  (unif-two-terms-problem-l t1 t2 g)
;      S-dag-t1-t2 = (initial-to-be-solved-l g-t1-t2)
; then:
;    (well-formed-dag-system S-dag-t1-t2 g-t1-t2)
;      and
;    (equal (tbs-as-system S-dag-t1-t2 g-t1-t2) 
;           (list (cons t1 t2)))  


;;; If we prove the above property, we will able to use the theorems
;;; proved in {\tt dag-unification-rules} to conclude the properties of
;;; a unification algorithm that applies the rules of transformation
;;; starting with the above initial unification problem.

;;; First, we show that resizing a list preserves the {\tt
;;; empty-graph-p} property:
