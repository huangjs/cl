; An Exercise in Graph Theory
; J Strother Moore

; This file is an ACL2 book.  To certify it, execute:
; 
; (certify-book "linear-find-path")
; 
; Read the paper to get the context.

; In this file, I define a linear version of find-path and prove that
; it is equivalent to find-path and thus satisfies the same
; specification.

; This is a pretty interesting exercise.  One issue dealt with is that
; the linear find-path is reflexive.

; I follow the standard approach of including an ``irrelevant'' test
; on the measure to admit a reflexive definitional equation.  Then I
; eliminate it and prove uniqueness (just as an example of handling
; reflexive definitions) before getting on with the real work of
; correctness.

; The correctness argument was sort of difficult.  I had to invent a
; few concepts to get it to go through.  The function returns two
; results.  The first is the answer as computed by find-path.  The
; other is an extended mark table.  I am only interested in proving
; the correctness of the first result.  But of course I have to prove
; stuff about the second too, since it is used in the recursion to
; compute the first.  The two results are thus linked and the key
; lemma, called step2 below, is a conjunction and the conjuncts have
; to be proved together.  To state the property of the modified mark
; table, I had to define the notion of a ``pathless'' extension of
; another mark table.

;    left-to-right rather than right-to-left.  To use an explicitly

; The Relation to find-next-step

; I will prove that linear-find-next-step is find-next-step.  My
; strategy is two-fold.  First, I will introduce an intermediate
; concept, namely find-next-step-avoiding, which finds a simple path
; while avoiding all nodes in a FIXED table.  I will prove that both
; find-next-step and linear-find-next-step are equal to this function.
; The second aspect of my strategy is that in proving the relationship
; between linear-find-next-step and the version that fixes the mark
; table, I will define a relationship between tables that allows one
; to be substituted for another without changing the answer.

; Here is the version of the algorithm with the fixed table.

; It is easy to prove that find-next-step is equal to the version with

; So we're left with step2, to prove that linear-find-next-step
