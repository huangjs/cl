(in-package "ACL2")

;; We define some macros which can be used for performing function inlining in
;; a very basic sense (in particular the function exec-trm would need to be
;; extended to support cond, case, let, and any other macros the user might
;; utilize.) The goal here is not to define a one-size-fits-all solution for
;; supporting inlining, but to instead demonstrate how inlining can be
;; performed through macros and the use of mbe, while still allowing nice
;; functional decomposition and control in the logic. Note that one potential
;; difficulty that a full-fledged :inline support would need to handle is
;; control over the mbe guard proofs which should be equal but may require some
;; guidance to ACL2 to avoid unnecessary effort (i.e. preprocessing,
;; normalization, case-splitting, etc.). Another glaring omission is support
;; for stobjs which is hindered by the still awkward handling of stobj-named
;; parameters for defmacro :(
