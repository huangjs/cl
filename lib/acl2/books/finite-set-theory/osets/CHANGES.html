<h3>Change Log</h3>

<h4>Version 0.91, January 28, 2006</h4>

<p>This is a relatively minor release for efficiency improvements and minor
tweaks to the reasoning strategy.</p>

<p><em>Certain operations are now tail recursive.</em> Previously, functions
   such as <tt>fast-union</tt>, <tt>fast-intersect</tt>,
   <tt>fast-difference</tt>, were not implemented tail recursively.  This could
   cause overflows on very large lists.  Thanks to David Rager for identifying
   this problem and for submitting patches to make these functions tail
   recursive, eliminating the problem.  Also made <tt>split-list</tt> tail
   recursive, at David Rager's suggestion.
   </p>

<p><em>Cardinality has been given a speed boost.</em> The executable version
   of cardinality now calls <tt>length</tt> instead of <tt>len</tt>.
   </p>

<p><em>Subset is now enabled.</em> Disabling the subset function was causing
   some problems in finishing pick a point proofs.  It is now enabled by
   default.
   </p>

<p><em>Added <tt>:built-in-clause</tt> rules about the <tt>acl2-count</tt> of
   <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt>.</p>

<p><em>Added the rule <tt>in-head</tt>, rewriting <tt>(in (head X) X)</tt> to 
   <tt>(not (empty X))</tt>.</p>


<h4>Version 0.9, October 22, 2004</h4>

<p>This is a major release.</p>

  <p><em>The library now requires ACL2 2.9.</em></p>

  <p><em>The set order has been changed.</em> We now use the same
  <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> as the total-order book.  Effectively, we make
  fewer assumptions about the set order, no longer requiring that nil
  be the greatest element.  This change might allow us to consider
  custom set orders in the future.  This was a bit of an undertaking.
  Many proofs in <tt>membership.lisp</tt> and <tt>fast.lisp</tt> have
  been changed to avoid relying on <tt>nil</tt>'s maximality.  There
  are also some changes in other low level theorems, such as
  <tt>head-insert</tt>.  There should be little or no impact on user
  theorems, unless you were reasoning "from first principles", e.g.,
  for "fast" functions defined using <tt>cons</tt> and so forth.</p>

  <p><em>Computed hints are now automatically managed.</em>
  Previously, the macros <tt>enable/disable-set-reasoning</tt> were
  used to turn on the computed hint for conducting pick-a-point
  proofs.  These macros have been removed and are no longer necessary,
  and pick-a-point proofs are automatically enabled.  (To disable
  them, disable the "tagging" theorem,
  <tt>pick-a-point-subset-strategy</tt>, instead.)  Thanks to Matt
  Kaufmann for modifying ACL2 to permit this change.</p>

  <p><em><tt>Membership.lisp</tt> has been cleaned up.</em> The
  support for computed hints have been separated out and put into its
  own package, <tt>COMPUTED-HINTS</tt>.  The encapsulate event which
  the pick-a-point subset strategy was based on is now more general
  and can be used with the new extensions in this release.  The
  pick-a-point method is now developed earlier in the membership.lisp
  file, and is used in order to prove many of the theorems which used
  to be based on induction arguments, e.g., <tt>subset-reflexive</tt>.
  </p>

  <p><em>A new package, <tt>INSTANCE</tt>, has been added to support
  the new extensions.</em>  Users should not need to use this package
  directly.</p>

  <p><em>New extension: constructive quantification.</em> This
  extension (in <tt>quantify.lisp</tt>) completely replaces typed sets
  with a more general and powerful theory of constructive
  quantification.  Given a k-ary (k > 1) predicate <tt>P</tt>, you can
  now quickly introduce a theory of quantification for that predicate
  over sets and lists.</p>
 
  <p><em>New extension: mappings.</em> Building off the base provided
  by constructive quantification, mappings allow you to discuss the
  images of sets under some arbitrary k-ary function, F, where (k > 1).
  As with constructive quantification, an elaborate rewriting strategy
  is also introduced for reasoning about mappings.  Mappings are also
  implemented more efficiently (via MBE) than the naive implementation 
  using repeated insertion.</p>

  <p><em>Mergesort is easier to reason about.</em> <tt>Mergesort</tt>
  now has a new logical definition via MBE, so that you can reason
  about it as if it were a simple, recursive insert sort.  Of course,
  it still acts as an efficient mergesort under the hood.  Thanks to
  Serita Nelesen for pointing out the deficiencies with the previous 
  approach.  I've also done away with the use of <tt>member-equal</tt>,
  and instead a new <tt>in-list</tt> function has been added which 
  returns a boolean instead of part of the list.</p>

  <p><em>Cardinality reasoning has been improved.</em> This is
  particularly true with regards to the cardinalities of
  intersections.  Added theorems <tt>cardinality-zero-empty</tt>,
  <tt>intersect-cardinality-non-subset</tt>,
  <tt>intersect-cardinality-subset-2</tt>, and
  <tt>intersect-cardinality-non-subset-2</tt>.  Also changed
  <tt>intersect-cardinality-subset</tt> to also be a :rewrite rule in
  addition to being :linear.  Thanks to Robert Krug and Hanbing Liu
  for their input in these changes.</p>

  <p><em>Subset reasoning has been improved.</em> Added the theorem
  <tt>subset-tail</tt> at Hanbing Liu's suggestion, which is useful
  for induction-style proofs of subset.  Also, the theorems
  <tt>difference-preserves-subset</tt> and <tt>subset-delete</tt>,
  have been added at Omar El-Domeiri's suggestion.  Finally,
  <tt>subset-insert</tt> has been added, and parallels
  <tt>subset-delete</tt>.</p>


<h4>Version 0.81, March 23, 2004</h4>

<p>This is a minor release to merge the library with ACL2.</p>

  <p><em>Matt Kaufmann has integreated the library with ACL2.</em> The
  library will now be part of the standard books released with ACL2.
  The build system has been modified to work nicely with ACL2's
  makefiles, changed the computed hints functions to be program mode
  in order to fix some problems with the new, more stringent guard
  checking in ACL2 2.8.  He has also updated the README to be more
  accurate about what is built, and cleaned up the stray parentheses
  in membership.lisp.  Thanks, Matt!</p>


<h4>Version 0.8, March 18, 2004</h4>

<p>This is a significant release, involving significant cleanup work
and a few new theorems.</p>

  <p><em>The build system has been significantly improved.</em> A file
  <tt>package.lisp</tt> has been added, and now contains the defpkg
  event for the set theory books, so you can now simply "ld" this file
  to get the set theory package.  The <tt>.acl2</tt> have been changed
  so that they do not contain include-book events, and
  <tt>sets.lisp</tt> now includes the other books locally and then
  redefines events from those books.  This approach makes loading
  <tt>sets.lisp</tt> faster, allows us to export events in a better
  order, and hides all of the local proofs.  These changes have all
  been made at the suggestion of Eric Smith.  Thanks!
  </p>

  <p><em>A mergesort has been added.</em> This allows you to quickly
  create a set from an unordered list which may contain duplicates, 
  and its performance seems quite good.</p>

  <p><em>Optional set order reasoning is now available.</em> The file
  <tt>set-order.lisp</tt> has been added and can be optionally
  included to help with reasoning about the set order.  Of course,
  this should only be done if you are arguing from "first principles"
  that your functions create sets, and should otherwise generally be
  avoided.</p>

  <p><em>Double containment is now a rewrite rule.</em>  A new theorem,
  double-containment, has been added in order to explicitly rewrite 
  equalities between sets into mutual subset statements.  The computed
  hints which previously performed double containment proofs have been
  removed.  

  <p><em>Computed hints can now be easily disabled.</em> The macro
  <tt>disable-set-reasoning</tt> has been added, and can be used to
  turn off the pick-a-point proofs that enable-set-reasoning turns
  on.</p>

  <p><em>Some new theorems help fill out the rewriting strategy.</em>
  In particular, the theorems <tt>difference-insert-X/Y</tt> and
  <tt>difference-delete-X/Y</tt> were added.</p>


<h4>Version 0.7, Feb 19, 2004</h4>

<p>This is a minor release, mainly introducing a new extension.</p>

  <p><em>A new induction scheme is now used for insert.</em> This
  induction scheme rephrases insert's operation in terms of membership
  rather than the set order, allowing inductive proofs over the
  definition of insert to avoid introducing the set order into
  proofs.</p>
 
  <p><em>New extension: typed sets.</em> This extension allows you to
  introduce a theory about sets which contain elements of a fixed
  type, e.g., <tt>integerp</tt>.</p>



<h4>Version 0.6, Feb 1, 2004</h4>

<p>This is the first publically available version of the set theory
library.</p>
