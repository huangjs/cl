  Build Instructions

    NOTE: You may already have a current copy of the library installed!
    Check your ACL2 distribution, under finite-set-theory/osets,
    to see what version of the library came with your copy of ACL2.
    Otherwise, here is how to build the library:

    1. Edit the makefile.

       - Change "include [...]/Makefile-generic" to point to the 
         file Makefile-generic in your acl2-sources/books 
         directory.

       - Change "ACL2 = acl2" to point to your ACL2 executable or
         script, typically "[...]/acl2-sources/saved_acl2"

    2. Run "make" to build the library.

       - Check to make sure that the following files were created:
         sets.cert, quantify.cert, set-order.cert, and map.cert.  
         If there was a problem, please send a report to 
         jared@cs.utexas.edu.

  All usage instructions are on the web page.
