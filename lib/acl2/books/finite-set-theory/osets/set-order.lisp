 set-order.lisp

   This is a top level file which you should use if you intend to 
   reason about the set order.  Normally you should not do this, 
   but you might need it if you want to argue "from first principles"
   that list operations create sets, i.e. for efficiency reasons.

   Note that merely including this file will do nothing for you.  
   You need to also enable the relavent theories:
    
      primitive-reasoning
        basic definitions of the primitive functions.  useful if you
        have a very low level proof about the stucture of sets or 
        something.  doesn't pertain to the order itself.

      order-reasoning
        properties of the order itself, and its relation to the set
        primitives.  most of the membership level is based on this.

      cons-reasoning
        properties relating cons to sets through the set order.  
        this might be useful if you are introducing new "fast" 
        functions, based on cons rather than insert to construct
        sets.  it is not easy to reason with.
