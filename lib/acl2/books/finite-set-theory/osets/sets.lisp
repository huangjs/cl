; We need some program-mode definitions which are used in order to
; automate the pick-a-point strategies.

(include-book "computed-hints")


; The definitions in this file are redundant from the local include
; books.  This approach has several advantages.
;
;  - it gives a better event order than simply including the books 
;    one by one
;
;  - this file is also faster to include than all of the local books
;    below, and allows the "ugliness" of auxilliary lemmas to be 
;    hidden away
;
;  - it makes clear that these theorems are public, and entirely
;    prevents the use of "internal" lemmas and theorems.
