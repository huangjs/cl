  The root of the IHS (Integer Hardware Specification) library hierarchy.~/

  Documented topics include:
  ~/

  This book is included by every book in the IHS hierarchy.

  The book \"ihs-init\" contains

  1.  Definitions of CLTL functions that should be part of the Acl2
  BOOT-STRAP theory.  Since Acl2 won't let us redefine any Common Lisp
  symbol, these functions are uniformly named by <CLTL name>$.
  
  2.  Functions that are not defined by CLTL, but that are otherwise
  candidates for the Acl2 boot-strap theory.
  
  3.  Unassigned functions that are general purpose, and will probably
  find a place in another book someday.

  4.  Definition of macros, macro helper-functions, and utility functions
  that are used throughout the IHS libraries.  We have no thought of ever
  verifying any of these.  Thus, the guards of certain functions may be just
  strong enough to get the functions admitted.~/")

  ENABLE/DISABLE theories.~/
  E/D creates theory expressions for use in IN-THEORY events, :IN-THEORY
  hints, etc.  It provides a convenient way to ENABLE and DISABLE
  simultaneously, without having to write arcane theory expressions.

  Examples:
  (e/d (lemma1 lemma2))                 ;Equivalent to (ENABLE lemma1 lemma2).
  (e/d () (lemma))                      ;Equivalent to (DISABLE lemma).
  (e/d (lemma1) (lemma2 lemma3))        ;ENABLE lemma1 then DISABLE lemma2 and
                                        ;lemma3.
  (e/d () (theory1) (theory2))          ;DISABLE theory1 then ENABLE
                                        ;theory2.~/

  General Form:
  (E/D enables-0 disables-0 ... enables-n disables-n)

  The E/D macro takes any number of lists suitable for the ENABLE and DISABLE
  macros (see :doc ENABLE and :doc DISABLE), and creates a theory that is
  equal to (CURRENT-THEORY :HERE) after executing the following commands:

  (IN-THEORY (ENABLE . enables-0))
  (IN-THEORY (DISABLE . disables-0))
  ...
  (IN-THEORY (ENABLE . enables-n))
  (IN-THEORY (DISABLE . disables-n)).~/"
