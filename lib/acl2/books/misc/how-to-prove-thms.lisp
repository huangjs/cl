; nice -- or nicer!

; This is a certified book.  Assuming the connected book directory
; (see set-cbd) is set to the directory containing this file, to
; recertify it, execute

; (certify-book "how-to-prove-thms")

; To include this book in a new session, execute

; (include-book "how-to-prove-thms")

; (or use the full pathname to this file from wherever directory
; you are on).

; However, we don't think this is a useful certified book and we certify
; it just to reassure ourselves that every event in it succeeds.  The
; real value of this book is to read it or to read the output produced
; by recertifying it.

; Another way to use the book is to load it into ACL2 and then use
; :ubt to undo back through some event in it so you can play with
; alternative scripts for some problem.

; (ld "how-to-prove-thms.lisp" :ld-pre-eval-print t)

; The output shown here is that for ACL2 Version 2.8.  It may well be
; different from the output of newer ACL2 releases.  But we expect
; the reported behavior to be very very similar.

; Section 6 - Three Basic Proof Techniques

; Solution to the Exercises in Section 6

; The single exercise in this section was not numbered because it is
; not really solvable.  But here is our discussion of the problem.
; Pretend the problem was named 6.1.

; If you undo or disable memp-app above and try to prove the theorem
; of Problem 6.1 you get the failed proof, partially reproduced, below:

#|
(defthm problem-6-1
  (equal (memp e (app a a)) (memp e a)))

Name the formula above *1.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Two induction schemes are suggested
by this conjecture.  Subsumption reduces that number to one.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (MEMP E A).  This
suggestion was produced using the :induction rules APP and MEMP.  If
we let  (:P A E) denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll use
is
(AND (IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP A)) (:P A E))
     (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP A)
                   (NOT (EQUAL E (CAR A)))
                   (:P (CDR A) E))
              (:P A E))
     (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP A) (EQUAL E (CAR A)))
              (:P A E))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit MEMP,
namely, the measure (ACL2-COUNT A) is decreasing according to the relation
O< (which is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized by O-
P).  When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
the following three nontautological subgoals.

Subgoal *1/3
(IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP A))
         (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP A A)) (MEMP E A))).

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :definitions APP and
MEMP and the :executable-counterpart of EQUAL.

Subgoal *1/2
(IMPLIES (AND (CONSP A)
              (NOT (EQUAL E (CAR A)))
              (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP (CDR A) (CDR A)))
                     (MEMP E (CDR A))))
         (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP A A)) (MEMP E A))).

This simplifies, using the :definitions APP and MEMP, primitive type
reasoning and the :rewrite rules CAR-CONS and CDR-CONS, to

Subgoal *1/2'
(IMPLIES (AND (CONSP A)
              (NOT (EQUAL E (CAR A)))
              (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP (CDR A) (CDR A)))
                     (MEMP E (CDR A))))
         (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP (CDR A) A))
                (MEMP E (CDR A)))).

The destructor terms (CAR A) and (CDR A) can be eliminated by using
CAR-CDR-ELIM to replace A by (CONS A1 A2), (CAR A) by A1 and (CDR A)
by A2.  This produces the following goal.

... <much omitted> ...

Subgoal *1.1.1/1'''
(IMPLIES (AND (NOT (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP A6 (CONS A1 A6)))
                          (MEMP E (APP A6 A6))))
              (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP A6 (LIST* A1 A5 A6)))
                     (MEMP E (APP A6 (CONS A5 A6))))
              (NOT (EQUAL E A1))
              (NOT (EQUAL E A3))
              (NOT (EQUAL E A5)))
         (EQUAL (MEMP E (APP A6 (LIST* A1 A3 A5 A6)))
                (MEMP E (APP A6 (LIST* A3 A5 A6))))).

Name the formula above *1.1.1.2.


This formula is subsumed by one of its parents, *1.1, which we're in
the process of trying to prove by induction.  When an inductive proof
gives rise to a subgoal that is less general than the original goal
it is a sign that either an inappropriate induction was chosen or that
the original goal is insufficiently general.  In any case, our proof
attempt has failed.

; Problem 8.9

; This problem illustrates the utility of introducing a new concept,
; namely, that of a list of atoms.  The basic idea is that if you take
; the leaves of a list of atoms, you get the same list back with an
; extra NIL at the end.  Then you just observe that (leaves x) is a
; list of atoms.  The thing about (leaves (leaves x)) that is
; suggestive of a problem is that leaves "wants" to explore the car
; and cdr of its argument, but produces a linear list.  So an
; induction to unwind the inner leaves is feeding the outer leaves
; something it cannot very well recur on.  You could probably find
; lemmas to tear it apart, through the apps produced by the inner
; leaves, but this decomposition is much nicer.

; Note: Actually, we would not use the lemma decomposition shown above
; because we don't like the lemmas.  But they do achieve a "simplify,
; induct, simplify" proof.  The reason they're needed is that when the
; theorem prover tries to prove memp-collect-lonesomep it invents an
; inductive argument that is a mixture of collect-lonesomep and memp.
; Its invention in this case is unfortunate and leads to an
; excessively complicated proof.  By telling it to do the induction
; suggested by collect-lonesomep alone, the proof is immediate.

; So in our first use of The Method here we looked at the induction
; argument generated, didn't like it, and added the following hint
; argument to the defthm for memp-collect-lonesomep:

;       :hints (("Goal" :induct (collect-lonesomep lst leaves)))

; And it went through simply.  However, since the student hasn't been
; told how to use hints, we decided this solution was not fair and
; followed The Method using only the techniques available to the reader.
