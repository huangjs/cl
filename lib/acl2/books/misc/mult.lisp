This ACL2 script solves a challenge posed by Bill Legato, to prove
that a program written for the Mostek 6502 microprocessor correctly
implements multiplication.  The program is described in 

A Weakest Precondition Model for Assembly Language Programs

by Bill Legato, dated June 19, 2000.  (A later version of this paper
also containing the program is available, which is currently FOUO.)

Comments from the 2.5x version of this script:

xx In this script we solve this challenge in the following steps:
xx 
xx
xx 1. Model the program in ACL2 using a stobj to represent state,
xx adding a definition for each line of the program, and combining the
xx lines into a program.
xx 
xx 2. Describe the algorithm abstractly in a function "loop-spec".
xx 
xx 3. Prove the loop-spec works.
xx 
xx 4. Prove that our Mostek 6502 program model works like loop-spec.
xx 
xx 5. Combine the lemmas of 3. and 4. into the final theorem.
xx 
xx Solving the challenge problem required 15 hours.
xx 
xx   1. Understanding the algorithm                1 hr
xx   2. Modeling the program in ACL2               2 hrs
xx   3. Wasting time working on the proof before 
xx      remembering yet again that decomposing 
xx      proofs is *always* the right thing to do   4 hrs.
xx   4. Proving that loop-spec works               3 hrs
xx   5. Proving that loop-spec works like the
xx      real program                               3.5 hrs
xx   6. Cleaning and documenting                   1.5 hrs
xx                                                 -------
xx                                                 15 hrs
xx 
xx 
xx The proof runs in under a minute under ACL2 2.5x, a version of ACL2
xx 2.5 enhanced with nu-rewriter patches.  The proof uses Super-IHS,
xx the Rockwell Collins ACL2 book that extends IHS.  It would take a
xx couple hours of work to port this proof to just-released 2.6, since
xx I'd have to identify the handful of Super-IHS lemmas that are
xx employed here and add their proof to the proof script.  (If anyone
xx wants me to do this, please let me know.)

The proof has now been ported to ACL2 2.6.  The port to 2.6 required
about 3.5 hours of work, plus 1 hour for rearranging the lemmas
sensibly and documenting.  Some Super-IHS rules were ripped out of
Super-IHS and put here so as to make this script depend only on
distibuted books.  

While I was at porting the proof, I spent some time reorganizing and
simplifying.  Most importantly, I eliminated the use of a spec
function to decompose the proof in this version.  The spec function
was important to me during the proof development, and is generally the
right thing to do on these kinds of proofs.  But once I knew what the
inductions were, etc., I was able to combine the two proof steps in
this case into one.  The resulting proof is far less pedagogical, but
it's so much shorter that I could not resist.

It's great to see that the techniques Greve and I use for microcode
proofs apply so directly to assembly code reasoning.

;; We now model the algorithm contained in Legato's paper.  We use the

;; means that

;; 1.  We employ IHS functions directly.  logapp, loghead, logtail,
;;     ash, logcdr, unsigned-byte-p etc. are all described in the IHS
;;     library that comes with the ACL2 distribution.
;; 2.  We employ an awkward, multiple-let-binding style.    
;;    
;; Note also that the Mostek 6502 microprocessor commands of this
;; program assume a big-endian byte, while we prefer a small-endian
;; style for proofs.  We model the operations how we like, but this
;; sometimes makes the model confusing.  Note for example that a
;; "right shift" command is implemented using the IHS function logcdr.
