; Abstract

; This book allows you to attach a non-negative rational priority
; number to your rules.  The priority number inversely indicates the
; importance of the rule: smaller numbers indicate more importance.
; After attaching priorities to your rules, all rules with non-0
; priority are to be disabled.  A default computed hint causes the
; simplifier to behave as follows: when a formula is stable under
; simplification at a given priority level, the priority level is
; bumped up to the next level and the rules at that level are
; additionally enabled.

; Thus, you may think of the rules as being grouped into a set of
; concentric circles.  The innermost circle contains the rules of
; priority 0.  The next circle contains all those rules plus the ones
; given the next highest priority, etc.  The simplifier starts with
; the rules in the innermost circle and simplifies until a subgoal is
; stable in that circle.  Then it wides the circle and starts over.

; Use

; To use priority phased simplification, 

; (include-book "books/misc/priorities")

; (set-default-hints (list *priority-phased-simplification* ...))

; where ... includes any other default hints you wish to install.
 
; Then, establish your priorities with add-priorities, etc.  Make sure
; that all prioritized rules are disabled in the global current
; theory.  This can be done by invoking (DISABLE-PRIORITIZED-RUNES)
; after you've declared the last prioritized rule.  If you add or
; delete prioritized rules, you must manage the disabling/enabling
; yourself.

; Then proceed.

; History

; The idea and utility of priority phased simplification was first
; suggested by Pete Manolios, in 1999.  He and Moore did some early
; experiments, modifying a private copy of ACL2 to support the notion.
; In that design, priorities were assigned when rules were added and
; heuristics were proposed for automatically computing priorities from
; defuns and defthms.  Consideration of priorities were fundamental to
; the operation of the ``waterfall.''  The design was somewhat more
; elaborate than the scheme described here.  But we never implemented
; a production version of the scheme.

; In July, 2001, computed hints were elaborated to include the
; stable-under-simplificationp flag and the :computed-hint-replacement
; feature.  These changes were ``inspired'' by Moore's unhappiness
; over the complexity of his ``staged simplifier hack'' for Rockwell,
; where he introduced bogus :elim rule and exploited it to cause a
; rewrite rule to fire when a subgoal was stable under simplification.
; After returning from Rockwell, Moore was working on various
; ``todos'' in preparation of the release of Version  2.6 and these
; changes involved computed hints, namely a suggestion by Jun Sawada
; that we have a default computed hint and a suggestion by Rob Sumners
; that we allow a hint to specify whether or not it is to be made
; available to its the children of the subgoal to which it applied.
; Kaufmann and Moore then designed the current (as of Version  2.6)
; version of computed hints and documented them.  In the course of
; writing documentation, Moore recalled the Manolios idea of priority
; based rewriting and suggested this book.

; We will keep a table, called priorities, that assigns priorities to
; rules.  The table is an alist, of course, accessed by (table-alist
; 'priorities world).  The keys will be assumed to be positive
; rationals.  The values will be assumed to be lists of runes or other
; items suitable for inclusion in a theory.  The operations on the
; table will be to add or delete an item from a given priority list,
; to clear all items from a given priority level, and to clear the
; table.

; The user is responsible for insuring that a prioritized rule be

; table.  We considered adding (in-theory (disable ,@items)) to
; add-priority above, so that prioritized runes were disabled when
; they're assigned priorities.  But then what does del-priority do?
; Does it enable the rune?  We don't like the idea of secretly enabling
; a rune.  So we have left the entire enabling/disabling business to
; the user but we have provided this convenient way to disable them
; all.
