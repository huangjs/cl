; The following question was posted on the University of Texas
; Computer Science problem web page (located at
; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/xli/prob/) numbered problem 13:

; Let f be a function from naturals to naturals.  (Note that naturals
; are non-negative integers.)  It is given that:
;   Property P:: for every n, f^2(n) < f(n + 1) holds.
; Here f^2(n) means applying f twice on n, that is, f(f(n)).
; Prove that f is the identity function.
; Generalization: Prove that f is the identity function given that:
;   Property Q:: for every n exists an i >= 2 such that f^i(n) < f(n + 1).
; (Similarly, f^i(n) means applying f i times on n.)

; For a classical proof of the theorem visit to the above mentioned
; web page.  The article posted at that location contains several
; versions of ACL2 verified proofs about the P and the Q properties.
; Here I include the strongest result only.  I wish to say thanks to
; Peter Manolios who followed upon the first version of the proof
; posted to the ACL2 meeting list.

; The following includes help ACL2 with arithmetic:
(include-book "../arithmetic/equalities")
(include-book "../arithmetic/inequalities")
(include-book "../ordinals/e0-ordinal")
(set-well-founded-relation e0-ord-<)

; A shorthand for naturals:
(defabbrev np (x)
  (and (integerp x)
       (>= x 0)))

; This form introduces a constrained f function with the
; Q property.  The 'iterated' version is also defined and
; it is called g.  The existence of i in the Q-property
; for a given n is captured by the Q-witness function.
; The type-prescription rules help ACL2 to reason more
; efficiently.
