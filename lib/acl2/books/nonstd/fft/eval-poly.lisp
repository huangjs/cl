This is in an ACL2 "book" with definitions and theorems about polynomial
evaluation.  Polynomials are stored in powerlists, a data structure similar to
lists, but more amenable to parallel recursion, because its
constructors/destructors are designed to deal with sub-powerlists, not with a
sub-powerlsit and an element (as with linear lists).

The basic definitions come from Misra's 1994 paper on powerlists.  This book is
nothing more than a transliteration of the basic definitions in [Mis94] into
ACL2.

To certify this book, first define the POWERLISTS package, then execute an
appropriate certify-book command.  Something like the following will work:

;; Now, we prove some basic theorems about polynomial arithmetic.

;; The first theorem is extremely useful.  It allows to reason about polynomial
;; evaluation of a vector in terms of vector arithmetic.  The previous
;; definition evaluated the polynomial pointwise at each point.  This theorem
;; uses the vector arithmetic operators, in a manner mimicking the polynomial
;; evaluation at a point.

					 (p-* x x)))))))

;; The remaining lemmas show how we can mix the vector arithmetic operators
;; defined earlier.  In particular, they detail the behavior of the unary
;; minus operator.  Note that the arithmetic operators below are all vector
;; arithmetic operators.  The equivalent theorems are trivial about numbers.

;; First of all, we show what happens when you consider -x * y, which we show
;; is the same as -(x*y).

;; As a special case of the above, -x * -x is equal to x*x.  This is a useful
;; theorem to prove, because the hypothesis that x is similar to x is trivially
;; true, so it's not needed (unlike the general case above).  So, by removing
;; the trivial hypothesis, this theorem is used more often as a rewrite rule.
