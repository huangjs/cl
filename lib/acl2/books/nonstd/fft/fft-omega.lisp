This is in an ACL2 "book" with definitions and theorems about an abstract
correctness proof of the Fast Fourier Transform.  The proof verified here comes
from Misra's 1994 paper on powerlists.  

To certify this book, first define the POWERLISTS package, then execute an
appropriate certify-book command.  Something like the following will work:
