;;; This book proves some theorems about nested sums.  A sum
;;; $\sum_{i}{a_i} is handled as a function a(i) that computes the ith
;;; term and a function sum_i that adds up the function a(i).  Nested
;;; sums use an outer sum sum_i, and inner sum sum_i_j, and a function
;;; a(i,j) to compute the ith/jth term.
