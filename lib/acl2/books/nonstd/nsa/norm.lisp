;; This book defines the regular norm on complex numbers.  It also
;; proves some very interesting properties about it.  Besides the
;; usual well-known properties, it establishes that norm preserves the
;; non-standard "magnitude" predicates (i-small, i-limited, and
;; i-large) and so we can reduce the question of when x is i-large to
;; when norm(x) is i-large.  Since many useful results were found for
;; the special case when x is real, asking the magnitude question on a
;; real number is easier than on a complex number -- and this norm
;; lets us do just that.
