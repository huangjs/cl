;;; This book develops a simple theory of the sine function.  This is
;;; a "throwawy" book, meant to flush out bugs and missing features in
;;; the non-standard analysis code of acl2(r).  The work was inspired
;;; by Matt Kaufmann's earlier book on sine; in fact, the main
;;; theorem, which is an approximation of sin(1/2) is his.

;;; This book should not be confused the trigonometric book of acl2(r),
;;; which follows a different path, defining sine(x) in terms of e^x.
;;; If you want to do real trigonometry, do NOT include this book.  If
;;; you want to learn about the non-standard analysis features in
;;; ACL2, by all means, go ahead and read this book!

;;; The approach here is to define the sine function in terms of its
;;; Taylor expansion.  The terms in the expansion are stored in a
;;; list, and their sum is computed by a separate function.  It is
;;; shown that the expansion sequence can be split into two parts.
;;; The first part has a i-limited number of terms, and its sum is
;;; i-limited.  The second part is a strictly alternating series, and
;;; so its sum is also i-limited.  Therefore, the entire sum is
;;; i-limited, hence the series is convergent and sine(x) can be
;;; well-defined.  The definition is given by the standard-part of the
;;; sum of an i-large number of terms.
