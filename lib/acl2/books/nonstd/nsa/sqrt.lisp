In this Acl2 book, we prove that the square root function can be approximated
in Acl2.  In particular, we prove the following theorem:

 (defthm convergence-of-iter-sqrt
   (implies (and (realp x)	
		 (realp epsilon)
		 (< 0 epsilon)
		 (<= 0 x))
	    (and (<= (* (iter-sqrt x epsilon) (iter-sqrt x epsilon)) x)
		 (< (- x (* (iter-sqrt x epsilon) (iter-sqrt x epsilon)))
		    epsilon))))

That is, for any non-negative number, we can approximate its square root within
an arbitrary positive epsilon.

The proof follows by introducing the bisection algorithm to approximate square
root.  Our bisection function looks like

    (iterate-sqrt-range low high x num-iters)

where low/high define the range being bisected, x is the number in whose square
root we're interested, and num-iters is the total number of iterations we wish
to perform.  This function returns a pair of numbers low' and high' which
define the resulting range.

The proof consists of two parts.  First of all, we show that for any high/low
range resulting from iterate-sqrt-range, if |high-low| is sufficiently small
(i.e., less than delta, which depends on epsilon) then |x-a^2| is less than
epsilon.  Secondly, we show that for any desired delta, we can find an adequate
num-iters so that calling iterate-sqrt-range with num-iters will result in a
high' and low' returned with |high'-low'| < delta.  The two proofs combined
give us our convergence result.

Note that we did not do the more natural convergence result, namely that after
iterating a number of times |low'-(sqrt x)| < epsilon.  The reason is that the
number (sqrt x) may not exist.  This result is shown in the companion book
"no-sqrt.lisp".  However, for those cases where (sqrt x) does exist, our proof
will naturally imply that (since we'll have a < (sqrt x) < b as a consequence
of a^2 < x < b^2 and also that |b-a| < delta < epsilon).  The interested reader
is encouraged to try that result.
