 This book establishes some facts about real differentiable
 functions.  It shows that differentiable functions are continuous.
 Also, it proves Rolle's theorem and from that the mean value
 theorem.

 The results are taken from books/nonstd/nsa/derivatives.lisp.

;; OK now, we want to prove the mean-value theorem.  We can actually

;; that rdfn2 vanishes at both a and b.  The function is given by rdfn
;; minus the line that goes from (a,(rdfn a)) to (b,(rdfn b)).
;; Because of this choice, when the derivative of rdfn2 is zero -- and

;; -- it folloes that the derivative of rdfn is the same as the slope
;; of the line from (a,(rdfn a)) to (b,(rdfn b)).  I.e., that point
;; satisfies the requirement of the mean value theorem.

;; First, we offer the definition of the function rdfn2.  Notice, the

;; that (rdfn2 x) is standard when x is standard, but since we use a
;; and b in the definition, that wouldn't be the case if a and b were
