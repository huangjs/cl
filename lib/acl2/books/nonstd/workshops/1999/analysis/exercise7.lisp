 This book presents a proof of the _classical_ Rolle's theorem.  In
 particular, it does not insist that its arguments be standard (as it
 shouldn't).

 Compare this with derivatives.lisp.  The key step is the definition
 of derivative-rdfn, where we use defun-std instead of defun.  That
 way, when we prove Rolle's theorem, we can use defthm-std and
 dispense with the hypothesis that a and b are standard-numberp.  This
 works because rdfn, and rolles-critical-point are both standard
 functions, and the only non-standard function in the original
 statement of Rolles theorem was derivative-rdfn:

    (defthm rolles-theorem
      (implies (and (realp a) (standard-numberp a)
		    (realp b) (standard-numberp b)
		    (= (rdfn a) (rdfn b))
		    (< a b))
	       (equal (derivative-rdfn (rolles-critical-point a b)) 0)))

 The rest of the proof is exactly the same as in derivatives.lisp.
