This is in an ACL2 "book".  It implementes the basic definitions and theorems
needed to reason about powerlists.  This book, as well as others working with
powerlists, is described in the paper "Defthms About Zip and Tie", UTCS tech
report TR97-02.

Powerlists are objects much like lists with the following basic differences:

    * There is no such thing as a singleton powerlist (i.e., a powerlist of
      length 1).  To represent the singleton <x>, we simply use x.

    * The basic constructors/destructors for powerlists are tie & zip.  Tie
      behaves like "list append", and zip behaves like a shuffle.  For example,

	(tie '<a1 a2 a3 a4> '<b1 b2 b3 b4>) = '<a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4>

	(zip '<a1 a2 a3 a4> '<b1 b2 b3 b4>) = '<a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3 a4 b4>

      It is expected that these operators are applied to powerlists of the same
      length, so that powerlists are usually of length 2^n.  Of course, our
      definitions are more general (ACL2 being a complete logic).

We implement powerlists as cons-trees.  We bias the implementation in favor of
tie, so that the tie of two powerlists is simply their cons.  With the expected
usage (i.e., tie/zip applied to lists of equal length), this will result in
perfectly balanced cons trees.

To certify this book, first define the POWERLISTS package, then execute an
appropriate certify-book command.  Something like the following will work:

    (ld "defpkg.lisp")
    (certify-book "algebra" 4)
