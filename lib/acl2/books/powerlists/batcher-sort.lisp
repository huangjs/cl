This is in an ACL2 "book" defining a batcher-merge sort for powerlists.  It
uses the infrastructure defined in merge-sort.lisp.    This book, as well as
others working with powerlists, is described in the paper "Defthms About Zip
and Tie", UTCS tech report TR97-02.

The informal correctness algorithm is as follows.  Consider merging two sorted
lists X = (x1 x2 ... xn) and Y = (y1 y2 ... yn).  We restrict ourselves to
lists of length n=2^k for some k.  Now, the merging step is given by

    (merge '(x1 x2 ... xn) '(y1 y2 ... yn))
	=
    (zip (min (merge '(x1 x3 ... x{n-1}) '(y2 y4 ... yn))
	      (merge '(x2 x4 ... xn)     '(y1 y3 ... y{n-1})))
	 (max (merge '(x1 x3 ... x{n-1}) '(y2 y4 ... yn))
	      (merge '(x2 x4 ... xn)     '(y1 y3 ... y{n-1}))))

Ok, now let's break this up into two pieces.  Consider the step

    (zip (min A B) (max A B))

This is sorted when A and B have this remarkable property:  A and B are
said to be interleaved if for any valid indices i<j:

    (1) Ai <= Aj
    (2) Bi <= Bj
    (3) Ai <= Bj
    (4) Bi <= Aj

Conditions (1) and (2) guarantee that A and B are sorted.  The remaining
conditions guarantee that the Ak/Bk should appear after A{k-1}/B{k-1} and
before A{k+1}/B{k+1} in the sorted sequence.  That is, to find the correct
position for Ak/Bk, we need only decide which of these comes first and then
ensure thay they're both before A{k+1}/B{k+1} and after A{k-1}/B{k-1}.  And
this, of course, is precisely what (zip (min A B) (max A B)) does.  The first
two elements of this list are (min a1 b1) (max a1 b1).  These are then followed
by (min a2 b2) (max a2 b2) and so on.

So, our proof reduces to this fact.  Given that X and Y are sorted, the
following are interleaved:

    (a) (merge (unzip-l x) (unzip-r y))
    (b) (merge (unzip-r x) (unzip-l y))

Why should we believe this property?  Well, let X and Y be as above, and let's
say formula (a) is A = (a1 a2 ... an) and (b) is B = (b1 b2 ... bn).  Now,
consider a valid pair of indices i<j.  That ai <= aj and bi <= bj follows from
the fact that (a) and (b) are sorted (i.e., the induction hypothesis).  Also,
we know that the a's and b's are either x's or y's.  So, since the list (a)
contains the odd-indexed x's, and the list (b) the even-indexed x's, for any
index i, the a's up to i can not contain less x's than the b's up to i.  This
is because any fewer x's have to be made up with some y's, and these are
even-indexed y's, so that (b) can't contain more y's than (a) does.  It's a
seemingly circular argument, but the base case is clear, and the rest follows.

So, together with the previous claim, this shows that merge does, indeed
generate a sorted powerlist when its inputs are sorted.

To certify this book, you need to define the POWERLISTS package and then run
certify-book on this file.  Here's how I do it:

;;; We are now trying to prove that the recursive calls to batcher merge return
;;; interleaved results.  The proof (outlined at the top of the file, and
;;; detailed in the tech report UTCS TR97-02) is based on reasoning about
;;; indices.  In particular, it can be proved by considering which X's and Y's
;;; can appear in corresponding prefixes of the two merged lists.  We replace
;;; the notion of indices with the (equivalent) notion of the number of
;;; elements smaller than a given X.  We say "equivalent", since the sublists
;;; are expected to be sorted.  (Of course, there's duplicates to worry about,
;;; but it turns out that's not a problem.)

;;; First, we define the concepts of p-member-count-<= and then we prove lemmas
;;; that allow us to compute this across the function symbols we already know.
