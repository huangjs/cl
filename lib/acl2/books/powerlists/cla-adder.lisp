This book proves the correctness of a carry-lookahead adder, by showing that it
performs the same function as a simple ripple-carry adder.  It was suggested by
Jay Misra, after he reviewed the paper "Defthms About Zip and Tie", UTCS tech
report TR97-02, in which we proved (among other things) the correctness of two
prefix-sum algorithms.

To compile it, I do the following:

    (ld "defpkg.lisp")
