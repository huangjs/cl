This is in an ACL2 "book" describing in general what it means to be a merge
sort.  It does this by introducing the stubbed functions split-1, split-2 and
merge that take a powerlist apart into two subpowerlists and merge two
sorted powerlists, respectively.  This book, as well as others working with
powerlists, is described in the paper "Defthms About Zip and Tie", UTCS tech
report TR97-02.

To certify this book, you need to define the POWERLISTS package and then run
certify-book on this file.  Here's how I do it:

    (load "defpkg.lisp")
    (certify-book "merge-sort" 4)
    (in-package "POWERLISTS")

;;; We begin by stubbing out the split and merge functions, as well as the
;;; mergeable and sortable functions which specify when a merge can be applied
;;; to a given list (e.g., only numeric lists can be merged).  As part of the
;;; stubbing process, we have to demonstrate two functions that have the
;;; required properties.  That is, we have to prove the correctness of a
;;; merge sort algorithm.  It would have been possible to prove a trivial
;;; merge sort algorithm, e.g., one where no lists are mergeable, but this
;;; only became possible after the introduction of the "sortable" predicate.
;;; So instead, we define the algorithm "insertion merge".  As far as we know,
;;; it hasn't been studied in the literature, and with good reason, since it
;;; isn't particularly clever.

 ;; Notice the awkward recursion in the merge definition.  It made some of the

 ;; Note, by the way, that p-insert is NOT stubbed or exported.  It is merely
 ;; an artifact used inside this encapsulate to witness the function merge.

 ;; We're annoyed by the next obligation.  We require that when you split/merge

 ;; problem is that the following is not an Acl2 theorem:
 ;;
 ;; 	(implies (equal (member-count (foo x) m) (member-count x m))
 ;;		 (implies (numbers x) (numbers (foo x))))
 ;;
 ;; because of the quantification problem on m: we need the forall inside the
 ;; implication.  I have not been able to come up with a satisfying solution to
 ;; this, but if I do, I'll remove the requirement as an assumption and prove
 ;; it outside of the stub.
