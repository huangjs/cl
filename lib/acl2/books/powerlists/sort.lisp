This is in an ACL2 "book" describing in general what it means to be a sort.
Our definition of sorted uses a total ordering on the elements that are allowed
in the powerlists.  That is, we restrict ourselves to powerlists of numbers
and consider the powerlist sorted with respect to <=.  One thing we have not
done is to consider the effect of different orderings.  We could, for example,
stub an ordering predicate LE and then axiomatize the needed properties over
some domain.  For the moment we are wary of giving up Acl2's built-in treatment
of < (i.e., linear rewrite rules).

This book is briefly described in the paper "Defthms about zip and tie", UTCS
tech report TR97-02.

To certify this book, you need to define the POWERLISTS package and then run
certify-book on this file.  Here's how I do it:

    (ld "defpkg.lisp")
    (certify-book "sort" 4)
    (in-package "POWERLISTS")
