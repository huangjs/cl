 compose-cc-partial.lisp
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this book we show the composition result for total correctness. The proof is
obvious, basically showing that runs compose ober their second argument. I am
doing only for clocks without loss of generality, since invariants can be shown
to be equivalent to clocks by our previous result. Given a total correctness
proof in terms of clock, you can functionally instantiate the capital DEFTHMS
in this book to get the composition of proofs.
