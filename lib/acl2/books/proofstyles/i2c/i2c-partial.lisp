  i2c-partial.lisp
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this book, I want to prove a partial correctness result using clocks. I
assume that I have been provided a traditional invariant proof showing partial
correctness. In particular, I assume that somebody has provided a function inv,
so that it is an invariant, is implied by the precondition and implies the
postcondition we are interested in. I want to show a result saying something
like this: "If there is a run that takes you from the precondition state to a
return state then the run is invatiably going to be taking you to a "good
state".

;; Here now I cannot use the constructive definition of clock which I did for
;; total correctness. But notice the beauty of defun-sk. All I need to do is
;; have a defun-sk that works. To be fair I could have used this same defun-sk
;; to do the total correctness. That would have been great for the sake of
;; uniformity, and it is easy to do this proof with them. But I like to get
;; constructive definitions sometimes especially when the recursion is
;; intuitive, and so I did not clutter that other book with this definition. By
;; the way, non-uniformity of our approach was a comment made by John Matthews
;; and Daron Vroon in their ACL2 workshop 2004 paper "Partial Clock Functions
;; in ACL2". My reaction to the comment it that it is possible to do it
;; uniformly, but I prefer things to be more intuitive and I think the other
;; way is more intuitive in this case.
