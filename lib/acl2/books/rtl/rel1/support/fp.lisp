; We now prove a bunch of bounds theorems for *.  We are concerned with bounding the
; product of a and b given intervals for a and b.  We consider three kinds of intervals.
; We discuss only the a case.

; abs intervals mean (abs a) < amax or -amax < a < amax, where amax is positive.

; nonneg-open intervals mean 0<=a<amax.

; nonneg-closed intervals mean 0<=a<=amax, where amax is positive.

; We now prove theorems with names like abs*nonneg-open, etc. characterizing
; the product of two elements from two such interals.  All of these theorems
; are made with :rule-classes nil because I don't know how to control their
; use.
