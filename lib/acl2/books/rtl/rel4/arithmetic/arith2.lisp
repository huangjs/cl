This book contains a hodgepodge of useful arithmetic rules.
It's still kind of a mess.  But it's better now that we have the rules in common-factor.lisp.

;instead of these, we should just cancel common factors from the constants

;open question: how to handle (equal (* 2 x) (* 3 y)) -- should we collect the constants or not? 
;maybe so, since doing so would let us substitue for one of the vars (x or y).

;don't yet handle negative constants
;prefers that quotient of the constants be > 1  -perhaps we want the quotient to be < 1???
;maybe the constant should be by itself?
