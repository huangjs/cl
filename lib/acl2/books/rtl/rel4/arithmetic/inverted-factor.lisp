treat constants separately.  careful.  do we prefer (equal x 1/2) or (equal (* 2 x) 1) ?
Now I think we definitely prefer (equal x 1/2) because this allows us to substitue for x.

when this
 (+ 1 x (* 2 x) (* x y (/ z)))
 appears in an equality, we want to multiply through by z
either returns nil or a term to multiply through

this assumes the term is already normalized.  this will be the case if we call this function on, say (equal
lhs rhs) because by the time the equal term is processed, lhs and rhs are each individually normalized
not necessarily!


warning; multiplying through by these factors can cause problems with linear arithmetic (expand on this...)

watch out.  how do we handle (< x 1/2) ?  do we multiply through by 2?

binds the variable k

(This used to be called find-frac-coeff.)
