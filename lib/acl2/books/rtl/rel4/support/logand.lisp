(in-package "ACL2")

#|
This book includes lemmas about LOGAND.  Note that LOGAND is a macro which expands to nested calls to
BINARY-LOGAND. Both LOGAND and BINARY-LOGAND are built into ACL2.

This book contains only results; all the proofs are done in the book logand-proofs.

Todo:
 use set-invisible-fns-alist - or find a better way?
 rules for logand x with lognot x anywhere in there?
 should logand-with-0 be both sides? what about logand-with-minus-one
 how order rules for efficiency? perhaps make a separate documentation book?
 any other log lemmas?
 are the 4 enough for assoc comm functions?
