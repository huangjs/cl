(in-package "ACL2")

;This book introduces the function cg (for "ceiling"), which is in many ways analogous to fl and which is used
;in the definition of the "away" rounding mode.

;todo: prove more thms about cg analogous to those about fl (maybe not worth doing since only fl is used to
;define, for example, bits).
