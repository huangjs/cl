In order to include all books of the library, simply include the book
"lib/top".  (All of the "support" books may similarly be loaded via
the book "support/top".)  Alternatively, a subset of these books may
be loaded, according to the user's intentions.  In particular,

(1) "rtlarr" is needed only if arrays are involved in the application.

(2) "basic", "float", "reps", "round", "fadd", "brat" and "package-defs"
    are intended to be used specifically for floating-point applications.

(3) "util" has no effect on the proof process and may be omitted.

(4) "arith" contains a set of arithmetic rules that past users have found
     useful; it may be omitted or replaced by another ACL2 arithmetic package.
    (We recommend the package in the "arithmetic/" directory, since it enforces normal 
    forms which the rules in "lib/" may depend on.
