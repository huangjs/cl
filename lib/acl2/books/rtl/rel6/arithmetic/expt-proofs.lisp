;==== A scheme for preventing massively expensive calls to expt =======

#| When ACL2 encounters a function call with constant arguments, the simplifier just evaluates the function on
those arguments.  However, calls of (expt r i) with huge i can be very expensive to compute.  (I suppose calls
with huge r might be very expensive too, but r is almost always 2 in my work.)  The scheme below prevents
(expt r i) from being evaluated when i is too large (but allows evaluation in the case of small i).

|#

(in-theory (disable (:executable-counterpart expt)))

(set-compile-fns t)
(defun expt-execute (r i) (expt r i))

;Allows expt calls with small exponents to be computed  
;You can change 1000 to your own desired bound.
(defthm expt-execute-rewrite
  (implies (and (syntaxp (and (quotep r) (quotep i) (< (abs (cadr i)) 1000))))
           (equal (expt r i)
                  (expt-execute r i))))


#|
The rules below are not complete, I proved them as needed to simplify terms like:
(* x
   (EXPT 2 1000001)
   (/ (EXPT 2 1000000))
   y)

Note that we could just compute (EXPT 2 1000001) and (EXPT 2 1000000) but that would be very expensive.

Perhaps we can make this into a complete theory, based on the observation that if a product contains two
factors of the form (expt 2 k) of (/ (expt 2 k)), where k is a constant, those factors will be brought
together because they are very close in the term order used order arguments to * (recall that unary-/ is
ignored when we decide how to order arguments to *).
