(in-package "ACL2")

;An attempt to include all the books in arithmetic/ (to check for name conflicts and so forth).

;Keep this list up-to-date:

(include-book "ground-zero") ;disables some of the built-in functions which should be disabled when ACL2 starts

(include-book "induct") ;Induction schemes			

(include-book "denominator")		 
(include-book "numerator")			
(include-book "nniq") ;lemmas about nonnegative-integer-quotient			

(include-book "complex-rationalp")		
(include-book "rationalp")			
(include-book "integerp")			

;BOZO What's the difference between these 4?
(include-book "arith")			
(include-book "arith2")			
(include-book "fp2")			
(include-book "basic") ;this is Doc's book.  mixed lemmas about fl, mod, expt, and squaring

(include-book "unary-divide")		
(include-book "product") ;mostly stuff about comparing a product to zero.

(include-book "inverted-factor")			

(include-book "negative-syntaxp") ;handy recognizer for terms with look negative, needed by some of the other books.

(include-book "predicate") ;splits an equality of two "predicates" into two implications			
(include-book "x-2xx") ;A very special-purpose lemma having to do with 2x^2

(include-book "power2p") ;recognizer for powers of 2			
(include-book "expt")			
(include-book "expo") ;sort of my top-level book dealing with powers of 2.

;I commented out these two because we don't need them in support/.  
;(include-book "hacks")			 ;BOZO Figure out exactly what this is.
(include-book "fl-hacks") ; needed for fl-m-n, at the least

(include-book "even-odd2") ;recursive analogues of evenp and oddp			
(include-book "even-odd") ;lemmas 1/2 and even and odd numbers


;;(include-book "floor-proofs")
(include-book "floor")
(include-book "fl")				
(include-book "cg")				
(include-book "mod")  

(include-book "fl-expt") ;lemmas mixing fl and expt			
(include-book "mod-expt") ;lemmas mixing mod and expt			

(include-book "common-factor") ;
