;;We define generic record accessing and updating functions to be used 
;;with RTL arrays.  The basic functions are (ag a r) and (as a v r)
;;where a is an array index, v is a value, r is an "array" or record.
;;(ag a r) returns the value at index a in array r, and (as a v r) returns 
;;a new array with index a set to value v in array r.
