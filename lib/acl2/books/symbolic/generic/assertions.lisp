In this book, we provide the missing piece of symbolic simulation necessary to
do the partial (and total) correctness proof using symbolic simulation. In
particular, we provide two theorems, which are |nextt cutpoint for cutpoint|
and |nextt cutpoint for not cutpoint|. These two theorems allow us to do
efficient symbolic simulation based on reasoning about cutpoints.
