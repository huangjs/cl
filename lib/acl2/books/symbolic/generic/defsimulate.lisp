  defsimulate.lisp
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we define a macro that takes a step function, a predicate specifying
cutpoints, and a default-state, and automatically generates the correctness
results. It does this by functionally instantiating the generic theorems in the
other books, namely partial-correctness.lisp and total-correctness.lisp. On the
way, it applies the work in assertions.lisp to obtain efficient symbolic
simulation rules.

Restrictions:

1. The functions precondition, postcondition, cutpoint, etc., must be functions
of the same arity. In addition the machine state must be the last formal of
these functions.

2. The function run, if provided (see :define-run keyword in the macro for
details of what I am talking about) must be a function of two arguments and the
first argument must be the machine state. I should have changed it to last for
lack of ambiguity, but since I have (run s n) ingrained in my brain I dont
think I can do the change reliably.

;; OK, some generic stuff. 

;; The function create-variables here takes a number n (think of the i to be 0)
;; and creates a list (s0 s1 ... sn). I use that list as formals inside the
;; macro.

  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (if (zp n) nil
    (cons (packn (list 's i))

;; snoc is inverse (literally) of cons...:->

(defun snoc (x e)
  (if (endp x) (list e) (cons (first x) (snoc (rest x) e))))

;; lastval and dellast, the names say it all. I am using these functions so
;; many times now, that I am now sincerely thinking that we should probably
;; have a generic book of "utilities" which has these functions in it.

(defun lastval (x) 
  (cond ((endp x) nil)
