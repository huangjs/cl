 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this book, I prove an alternative theorem for fast symbolic simulation to
prove total correctness. This set of constraint guanrantees that the theorem
|some cutpoint is reachable| that I wrote for the total correctness theorem can
be proved via symbolic simulation based on next-cutpoint. I keep it here as
opposed to the original book since I treat the original book as specifying the
actual total correctness theorem and this book is merely a subsidiary for fast
symbolic simulation. This book will be made use of in the defsimulate macro.
