In this book, we use the defsimulate macro to show that the fibonacci program
on the tiny machine is correct. I show both partial and total correctness. I do
nothing with the definitions either of the model or of the program, but I do
change the way cutpoints, assertions, and pre and post conditions are
represented.

;; I probably need to fix this. I had specified in the defsimulate macro that

;; macro. In lieu of that the only option I have is to make dummy-tiny-state be
