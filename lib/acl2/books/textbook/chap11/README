 Kluwer Academic Publishers, June, 2000.

See books/textbook/README for a guide to all solutions and general
information.

The following files (or extensions) may be present on this directory.

README     - guide to contents of the directory
Makefile   - Unix file for recertifying the ACL2 books on the directory
             (present on all but chap7, which contains no books)

*.lisp     - certifiable ACL2 book containing solutions to exercises
*.txt      - solutions to exercises not amenable to ACL2 formulation
*.acl2     - driver used by Makefile to recertify some *.lisp files

*.cert     - certificate indicating that *.lisp has been certified
*.date     - date of beginning of recertification run
*.log      - output of make
*.out      - output produced by ACL2 during certification
*.o        - compiled version of *.lisp file in some Common Lisps
*.fasl     - compiled version of *.lisp file in some Common Lisps

Any file with the extension ``.lisp'' is a certifiable book that can
be included into your ACL2 session with include-book.

To recertify all the books, stand in this directory and type make.

Location of Solutions to Particular Exercises

We provide more than one solution for some exercises.  This is just a
matter of taste.  Different authors prefer different styles.
Sometimes, one solution is less elegant than another but more clearly
indicates how the solution was discovered.
