; In this book we prove the ACL2 version of:

; (forall e : (how-many e a) = (how-many e b)) -> (perm a b)

; where (how-many e a) is the number of occurrences of e as an
; element in a.

; We actually constrain (alpha) and (beta) to satisfy the hypothesis
; and prove that they satisfy the conclusion.

; We use the perm from this book which we happened to have.  We don't
; have to load these books until the first time we need them, but we
; know we will need them so we load them now.

; Exercise 11.49

; We hope you didn't waste too much time on this problem!

; As noted in the errata:

; On page 220, Exercise 11.49 is simply wrong.  The formula alleged not
; to be a theorem is a theorem, so no counterexample is possible!  What
; we had in mind has nothing to do with mergesort but instead is an
; observation about perm, how-many, and quantification.  The exercise
; should have been:

;  Exercise 11.49  The following is a theorem in a suitable logic
;  permitting ACL2 terms and first-order quantification.

;    (perm a b)
;  <->
;    (ALL e (equal (how-many e a)
;                  (how-many e b)))

; Here, by ALL we mean the universal quantifier.  The universal
; quantifier in the above theorem is important.  The similar looking
; ACL2 formula

; (iff (perm a b)
;      (equal (how-many e a)
;             (how-many e b)))

; is not a theorem.  Exhibit a counterexample.

; Here is our solution to THAT problem!

(defthm counterexample-49

; Note that to make this command a suitable event for a book, we had to
; phrase it as a theorem.  Our theorem is just that a certain instance
; of the formula evaluates to nil.

; We don't have universal quantification.  But we can define a recursive

; We define (bounded-quantifierp x a b) to check that for every e in
