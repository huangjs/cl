Testing the NON-Unicode parts (i.e., the low level byte readers)

Running these tests:
  1.  Edit the makefile and point BIG_FILE at a big file on your 
      system (it needs to be larger than SIZE_IN_KB kilobytes.
  2.  Edit the file timing.lisp and point it at the correct IO
      directory.
  3.  Run "make &> results" and go relax for awhile
  4.  Come back and read the file results.


Testing the Unicode parts

  1.  Open the file unicode.lisp and submit the proper forms.
