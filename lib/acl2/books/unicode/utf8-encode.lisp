;; Conversion From Unicode to UTF-8 ===========================================
;;
;; Recall that as uchar?s and within ustring?s, we store code points atomically
;; as single integers.  It is relatively straightforward to convert these
;; codepoints into UTF8 byte sequences.
;;
;; We now introduce the function uchar=>utf8, which, as its name suggests will
;; take any uchar and return to us the corresponding byte sequence in UTF-8.
;; This function is based on Table 3-5, and is in essence a straightforward
;; translation of this table, based on shifting the bits of the codepoints into
;; the correct locations for our output bytes.

;; table is written as it is, it all seems rather random/arbitrary.  Rather
;; than try to actually understand any sort of deeper meaning here, I will just
;; have ACL2 run an exhaustive test to prove that every uchar has a
;; satisfactory encoding under our function.
;;
;; This is so easy it feels like cheating.  It is a really easy way to get this
;; complicated theorem through, and it is useful later in the file as well.
;; Our method is to first write a testing function, to test all the integers
;; between 0 and i.
