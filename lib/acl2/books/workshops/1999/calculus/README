To recertify the exercise solutions, simply execute "make" in this directory
(assuming your system understands "make").  However, in order to recertify the
case study input and construct book/outline, you will have to build ACL2(r)
(see :doc REAL) and proceed from under
books/nonstd/workshops/1999/calculus/book/.  If you do not already have that
directory, you can fetch it together with all the non-standard analysis books
by clicking first on "Obtaining and Installing" on the ACL2 home page, and then
clicking on "OBTAINING AND INSTALLING ACL2".

If you care to use the outline tool for your own work, please see the end of
book/README in the above directory under the heading "USING THE PROOF OUTLINE
TOOL."

The exercise solutions are in subdirectory solutions/.  See solutions/README.
