;; The Compiler Correctness Proof - Part 1
;;
;;===========================================================================
;;
;; This file contains parts of the compiler correctness proof for the
;; miniComLisp (called SL in the paper) compiler defined in "compiler.lisp"
;; with respect to the semantics of miniComLisp as defined in "evaluator.lisp"
;; and the machine semantics as defined in "machine.lisp". In this book we
;; prove the base case of the induction, i.e. we prove (cc-theorem form ...)
;; for program constants and variables. You will also find some additional
;; technical lemmas which we need for the proof (see "proof.lisp").

;; In the following we prove theorems about the evaluation and execution of
;; operator calls which allow us to disable the large conditionals evlop and
;; opr. So far, these theorems are not used, because we only succeeded in
;; proving the induction base case yet. Perhaps these theorems have to
;; reformulated in order to really help for the proof.

;; the result of associating a variable in the environment of the evaluator,
;; and the variable access in the stack, to the position of that variable in
;; the compiletime environment. Although there is a (tail recursive)
;; definition of the Lisp function position available, we prefer to define our
;; own my-position recursively for the same reason we already defined mytake
;; instead of using take: the proofs we need just do not work if we use the
;; standard Lisp (ACL2) functions. Note: We use my-position only in the proof,
;; so this definition is harmless. But mytake (replacing take) is used by
;; get-stack-frame and thus for formulating the correctness theorem. We have
;; to be careful to really espress what we want. Anyway.
