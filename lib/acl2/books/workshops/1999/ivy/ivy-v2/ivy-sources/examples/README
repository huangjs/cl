To test Ivy on all of the examples, run (while in this directory)

  ./test-all  ../util/ivy

This should run 11 tests, and all should succeed.

Note that you have to have write permission in the
directory that contains the input files (this directory),
because Ivy creates intermediate files there.
If you don't have write permission, copy the whole
directory, then run "./test-all <full-pathname-to-ivy>".

To run just one test, say steam:

  ../util/ivy  prove  steam

(You have to have write-permssion for this as well.)

Some of the input formulas are theorems, some are unsatisfiable,
and some are neither.  There are 4 things you can try

   prove        (calls Otter)
   refute       (calls Otter)
   disprove     (calls MACE)
   model        (calls MACE)

See test-all for the "correct" thing to try for each example.

Also, there is a stand-alone proof checker that checks proof
objects that already exist.  If you have a file that contains
proof objects (for example, an Otter output file), say
otter-cn.output you can check them like this:

   ../util/checker otter-cn.output
