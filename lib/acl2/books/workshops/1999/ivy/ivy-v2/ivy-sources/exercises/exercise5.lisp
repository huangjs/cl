;; Startup file for exercise 5.
;;
;; Conjunctions and disjunctions are binary, which makes it inconvenient
;; to write conjectures with several hypotheses.  Define a function 
;; to convert a formula with multiple-arity conjunctions and
;; disjunctions to a formula with binary conjunctions and disjunctions.
;; Decide what properties have to be proved to demonstrate that your 
;; approach is acceptable, and prove those properties.
