;; In this book we define a relation (prop-subsume c d), which
;; checks if formula c propositionally subsumes formula d.
;; This is intended for quantifier-free formulas (in particular,
;; clauses and lists of clauses), but it is sound for all formulas.
;; For quantified formulas, prop-subsume is true iff the formulas
;; are equal.
;; 
;; Soundness: if (prop-subsume c d), then
;; (univ-closure c) => (univ-closure d).
;; 
;; This is not propositionally complete; that is, it is weaker
;; than "implies".
