;; The pull books are arranged like this:
;;
;;        pull-top
;;          /  \
;; pull-pulls  pull-sound
;;          \  /
;;          pull
;;
;; This book (pull) has the main definitions and some
;; preservation-of-property theorems.  The top definition
;; is (pull-quants f), which pulls quantifiers to the
;; top of a formula.

;;--------------------------------------
;; Function pull (f) moves quantifiers toward the root of a formula
;; as much as possible, using rules like
;; (or p (all x q)) <=> (all x (or p q)) if x is not free in p.
;; Bound variables are NOT renamed.  If all bound variables are
;; unique, the formula is closed nnf, then all quantifiers should
;; come to the top.  (That property proved elsewhere.)  Here,
;; we define the functions and prove soundness.
;;
;; Pull-top-left pulls quantifiers up from the left side, and
;; pull-top-right from the right side.
;; 
;; The first functions I wrote were a little simpler than these.
;; Originally, when pull-top right got to the base case, it called
;; pull-top-left.  Now, they are independent (and the same except for
;; left/right):  we first pull-top-left, then call down-right,
;; which goes back down to the 'and or 'or and calls pull-top-right.
