;; This book is a little add-on to Ivy.  I imagine there will
;; times when we wish to simply check a proof object, without
;; using Ivy's preprocessing.  For example, if a prover
;; can build proof objects, but it is inconvenient to use
;; Ivy's preprocessing.
;;
;; Function (bcheck proof) below checks if its input is a proof
;; object, fixes the substitutions (just like refute-n-check),
;; and checks it.  Ths soundness theorems says that if the
;; input steps are true, then all the steps are true.
;;
;; Bcheck is similar to the checker of our 1994 Nqthm project.
;; (But we didn't have any soundness proofs back then.)
