;;COMPILE-PIPELINE generates an executable ACL2 representation of a
;;pipeline that computes the value of a specified output signal as a
;;function of inputs.  If the output of the RTL-ACL2 translator is
;;the file "<fname>.trans", then the executable version is written to
;;"<fname>.lisp".

;;A second file, "<fname>-star.lisp", is also generated.  This file
;;implements a scheme for proving theorems about the executable version.
;;This file contains a definition of a constant function SIG*
;;corresponding to each noninput signal SIG, and a theorem that allows
;;these functions to be used in place of the executable model.  Before
;;the file can be loaded, a constant function symbol IN* corresponding
;;to each input signal IN must be introduced and appropriately
;;constrained (via ENCAPSULATE) by the user.

;;In the following definitions, the parameter defs represents a list
;;of all the forms read from the input file "<fname>.trans".


;;a list of the names of all defined signals:

(defun get-sig-names (defs)
  (if (consp defs)
      (cons (cadar defs) (get-sig-names (cdr defs)))
    ()))

;;list of all input names:

(defun get-input-names (defs)
  (if (consp defs)
      (if (eql (caar defs) 'definput)
	  (cons (cadar defs) (get-input-names (cdr defs)))
	(get-input-names (cdr defs)))
    ()))

;;the signal definition for a given name:

(defun find-signal (name defs)
  (if (consp defs)
      (if (eql name (cadar defs))
	  (car defs)
	(find-signal name (cdr defs)))
    ()))

;;a list of all the signal names that occur in a term:

(mutual-recursion
 
 (defun signals-occurring-in-term (term defs)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (cond ((not (consp term))
	  ())
	 ((consp (car term))
	  (signals-occurring-in-term-list term defs))
	 ((find-signal (car term) defs)
	  (union-eq (list (car term))
		    (signals-occurring-in-term-list (cdr term) defs)))
	 (t
	  (signals-occurring-in-term-list (cdr term) defs))))
 
 (defun signals-occurring-in-term-list (terms defs)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (if (consp terms)
       (union-eq (signals-occurring-in-term (car terms) defs)
		 (signals-occurring-in-term-list (cdr terms) defs))
     ())))

;;a direct supporter of a signal is a signal that occurs in its definition:

(defun direct-supporters (name defs)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (signals-occurring-in-term (cadddr (find-signal name defs)) defs))

(defun direct-supporters-list (names defs)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (if (consp names)
      (cons (direct-supporters (car names) defs)
	    (direct-supporters-list (cdr names) defs))
    ()))

;;A supporter of a signal is a direct supporter or a supporter of a
;;direct supporter.  The function CHECK-CIRCUIT determines whether 
;;there exists a signal that supports itself.  Its definition depends
;;a function FIND-CYCLE, which takes a signal and a set of signals and
;;looks for a path of direct support from the signal that either contains
;;a cycle or leads to some member of the set:

(mutual-recursion
 
 (defun find-cycle (sig set checked defs)
   ;;Look for 
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (cond ((member sig checked)
	  ())
	 ((member sig set)
	  (cons sig set))
	 (t
	  (find-cycle-list (direct-supporters sig defs)
			   (cons sig set)
			   checked
			   defs))))
 
 (defun find-cycle-list (list set checked defs)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (and (consp list)
	(or (find-cycle (car list) set checked defs)
	    (find-cycle-list (cdr list) set (cons (car list) checked) defs)))))

;;EXTRACT-CYCLE returns the cycle found by FIND-CYCLE:

(defun extract-cycle (new base old)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (if (consp new)
      (if (eql (car new) base)
	  (cons (car new) old)
	(extract-cycle (cdr new) base (cons (car new) old)))
    ()))

;;CHECK-CIRCUIT returns either a cycle or the symbol NIL:

(defun check-circuit (defs)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (let ((cycle (find-cycle-list (get-sig-names defs) () () defs)))
    (and cycle
	 (extract-cycle (cdr cycle)
			(car cycle)
			(list (car cycle))))))

;;Once a circuit is known to be acyclic, we may order its signals in
;;such a way that each signal is preceded by all of its supporters:

(defun ordered-signals-aux (names defs list)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (cond ((not (consp names))
	 list)
	((member (car names) list)
	 (ordered-signals-aux (cdr names) defs list))
	(t
	 (ordered-signals-aux (cdr names)
			      defs
			      (cons (car names) 
				    (ordered-signals-aux 
				      (direct-supporters (car names) defs)
				      defs
				      list))))))

(defun ordered-signals (defs)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program))
  (reverse (ordered-signals-aux (get-sig-names defs) defs ())))
