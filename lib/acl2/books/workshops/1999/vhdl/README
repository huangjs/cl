This directory contains the supporting files for Chapter 11, "Using
Macros to Mimic VHDL", by Dominique Borrione, Philippe Georgelin, and
Vanderlei Rodrigues, in "Computer-Aided Reasoning: ACL2 Case Studies",
edited by M. Kaufmann, P. Manolios, J Moore (Kluwer, 2000, p.167-182).

These files are named :
vhdl.lisp
fact.lisp
fact-proof.lisp
exercises.lisp

File vhdl.lisp contains:
- the macros (_entity, _architecture , _process) with which a VHDL
  design can be written in a resembling lisp syntax,;
- all the necessary functions to construct the ACL2 model from the
  initial VHDL design.

File fact.lisp is the example in Figure 1.  It is the description of the
circuit that computes the factorial function, using two concurrent
processes.  It uses the macros defined in the preceding file.

File fact-proof.lisp contains all the useful theorems about the behavior
of the design described in fact.lisp, and the theorems leading to the
proof of functional correctness described in section 5.

File exercises.lisp contains solution to the exercises in this chapter,
including the theorems.
