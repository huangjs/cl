# Below are the directories containing books to be certified.

# The following do not have any certifiable books:
# goerigk sawada shumsky wilding

# The following remain to be dealt with:
# cowles/books -- tarai4 is resource-demanding: crashes some lisps, overflows
#                 in others.  At some point we may deal with this.
#                 Also, a change will be needed for v2-6 in tarai6, to get
#                 through lemma tarai=Fb-3.
