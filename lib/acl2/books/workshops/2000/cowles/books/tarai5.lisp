;; The function Fb satisfies the tarai recursion and the
;;  restricted tarai recursion for lists of lengths between
;;  2 and 7. This book summarizes books tarai1-tarai4.

;; Times using 600 MHz pentium:
;;  The book in tarai3.lisp requires over 46 min. to certify.
;;  The book in tarai4.lisp requires over 3.85 hours to 
;;   certify.

;; Many of the books tarai2-tarai4 require ACL2 Version 2.5
;;  or later to certify. A feature, of the implementation of
;;  linear arithmetic in Version 2.4, that prevented the
;;  straightforward proofs of some theorems in these books,
;;  has been eliminated in Version 2.5. (Essentially, the
;;  2.4 version of linear arithmetic sometimes dealt with
;;  equations of the form  VAR = Term by substituting Term
;;  for SOME, but NOT ALL, occurrences of VAR.)
