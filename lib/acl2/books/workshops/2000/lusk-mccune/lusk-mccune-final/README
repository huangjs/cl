ACL2 for Parallel Systems Software

This directory contains version sim19 of our multiprocess
simulator.  It is described in a short paper (paper.ps).

This represents the early stages of a work in progress.
The simulator doesn't have all the functions we write
about in the paper, it is not well debugged, and it is
slow.  The guard proofs are very slow.  But it's s start :-)
