A "makefile" is provided to certify the books included in this
directory. It is only necessary to run (GNU) make, possibly changing
the (make-)variable ACL2 to suit your needs. For example, you can use

% make

if the command acl2 starts ACL2 in your system, or

% make ACL2=your_acl2

in other cases.

There is another possibility for people using Emacs. It suffices to
type M-x compile RET to get the output in an Emacs compilation buffer.
