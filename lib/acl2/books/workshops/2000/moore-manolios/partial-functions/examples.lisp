; The above lemma may not look very interesting.  But the following observation
; shows that it is:

(defthm setColorBox-heap-property
  (implies (and (refp ref)
                (refp this))
           (equal (deref ref
                         (setColorBox-heap this p1 p2 color s))
                  (if (and (equal ref this)
                           (inBox this p1 p2 s))
                      (set-instance-field "ColoredPoint" "color" color
                                          (deref this (heap s)))
                    (deref ref (heap s))))))

; Several problems have come to light.
; (1) The role of s1 in example4.
; (2) The more general difficulty of counting cycles in the presence of
;     of overriding.  I really need a predicate that says "this clock
;     is appropriate for this method body"
; (3) Lack of evidence that something meaningful can be done with the heap.
;     By this I mean to suggest work on extracting abstract objects from
;     the heap.  If the abstract object is an object in ACL2, this is
;     probably straightforward.  If it is some circular object, it must
;     be represented more or less as a heap object.  That being the case,
;     it seems that this problem is really one of just getting used to
;     a suitable bunch of primitives like deref and get-instance-field.
