;;; *******************************************
;;; ABSTRACT PROOFS: DEFINITIONS AND PROPERTIES
;;; *******************************************

;;; ============================================================================
;;; 1. Proof steps
;;; ============================================================================

;;; We see here proofs from a very general point of view. Proofs are
;;; lists of r-steps, and r-steps are structures with four fields:
;;; elt1, elt2, direct and operator (every step "connect" elt1 and elt2
;;; in the direction given by direct, and by application of operator). 

;;; Definition and properties about manipulation of proofs and its form
;;; are given here. 

;;; The following is the definition of an abstract reduction step:

(defstructure r-step
   direct
   operator
   elt1
   elt2
   (:options (:conc-name nil)
	     (:do-not :tag)))   

;;; REMARK: An abstract proof will be defined as a list of r-steps. Note
;;; that, in this book, we do not require that the operator is applicable
;;; to one of the elements returning the other. This will be required
;;; for each particular reduction relation. We are only concerned with the
;;; "shape" of proofs.
