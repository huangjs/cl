;;; ****************************************************************************
;;; LOCALLY CONFLUENT AND TERMINATING REDUCTION RELATIONS HAVE A
;;; DECIDABLE EQUIVALENCE CLOSURE
;;; ****************************************************************************


;;; We prove that every noetherian, locally confluent reduction relation
;;; has decidable equivalence closure. This is a good example of how
;;; functional instantiation can be useful. This result can be easily
;;; proved by functional instantiation of the results in the books
;;; previously developed. Using confluence.lisp, we need to show that
;;; the reduction relation is normalizing and has the Church-Rosser
;;; property. And the Church-Rosser property can be proved by using
;;; Newman's lemma, proved in newman.lisp. The normalizing property is
;;; an easy consequence of noetherianity.

;;; ============================================================================
;;; 1. A Tool for functional instantation
;;; ============================================================================

;;; In this file we have to extensively use functional
;;; instantiation of results previously proved. The functional
;;; instantiations we have to carry out are always of the same kind:
;;; the functional substitution relates functions with the same symbol
;;; name but in different package and the same happen with individual
;;; variables.  We define the following functions in :program
;;; mode to provide a tool to make this kind of functional-instance
;;; hints convenient.

(local
 (defun pkg-functional-instance-pairs (lemma-name symbols)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (if (endp symbols)
       nil
     (cons (list (acl2::intern-in-package-of-symbol
		 (string (car symbols)) lemma-name)
		 (car symbols))
	   (pkg-functional-instance-pairs lemma-name (cdr symbols))))))
                 
(local
 (defun pkg-functional-instance
   (id lemma-name variable-symbols function-symbols)
   (declare (xargs :mode :program))
   (if (equal id (acl2::parse-clause-id "Goal"))
       (list :use (list* :functional-instance
			 (list* :instance
				lemma-name
				(pkg-functional-instance-pairs
				 lemma-name variable-symbols))
			 (pkg-functional-instance-pairs
			  lemma-name function-symbols)))
     nil)))


;;; The function pkg-functional-instance computes a hint (see
;;; computed-hints in the ACL2 manual) and is called
;;; in the following way:

;;; (pkg-functional-instance id lemma-name variable-symbols
;;;                          function-symbols) 

;;; where:

;;; id:               is always the variable acl2::id 
;;; lemma-name:       the name of the lemma to be instantiated
;;;                   (including the package). 
;;; variable-symbols: the list of symbol names of variables to be 
;;;                   instantiated.
;;; function-symbols: the list of symbol names of functions to be
;;;                   instantiated. 

;;; The computed hint is the functional instantiation of the lemma-name,
;;; relating each variable name and function name (of the package where
;;; the lemma has been proved) to the same symbol name in the current
;;; package.  


;;; ============================================================================
;;; 2. Formalizing the hypothesis of the theorem
;;; ============================================================================

;;; REMARK: This section is exactly the same as in newman.lisp:
;;; formalization of noetherianity and local confluence. Nevertheless,
;;; since we have to compute normal forms and the function
;;; proof-irreducible, we have to assume the existence of a reducibility
;;; test given by a function reducible with the following properties for
;;; every element x:  
;;; 1) When reducible returns non-nil, it returns a legal operator for x.  
;;; 2) When reducible returns nil, there are no legal operators for x.
;;; See newman.lisp and confluence-v0.lisp for more details.

;;; reduction relation defined later)
