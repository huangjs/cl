This directory contains an ACL2 proof of the Chinese Remainder
Theorem, as described in a paper presented at ACL2 Workshop 2000. The
entire proof is contained in the single event file 
<a href="./crt.lisp"><code>crt.lisp</code></a>, except that it depends 
on some lemmas from the author's
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/others/fp-README.html">
library of floating-point arithmetic</a>.
In order to certify this file (after obtaining and certifying the library), first replace each
of the two occurrences of "<code>/u/druss/</code>" with the path to the directory under which
your copy of the library resides.  A second event file,
<a href="summary.lisp"><code>summary.lisp</code></a>,
which contains the definitions and main lemmas involved in the proof, may then be certified.

<p>

You can download a <a href="support.tar.gz">gzipped tar file</a> containing
this file together with the two event files discussed above.
