<HEAD><TITLE>Concurrent Deque Proof in ACL2</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<pre>
The books in this directory define a refinement proof correlating
a concurrent deque implementation to a simple deque specification.

The refinement proof is broken into the following chain:

     cdeq <-> cdeq+ <-> intr <-> intr+ >> spec

Gzipped tar file: <A HREF="../cdeq.tar.gz">cdeq.tar.gz</A>

BOOK descriptions
-----------------
<A HREF="records.lisp">records.lisp</A>     -- defines record operations and theorems
<A HREF="cdeq-defs.lisp">cdeq-defs.lisp</A>   -- defines the step functions and several supporting lemmas
<A HREF="cdeq-phase1.lisp"cdeq-phase1.lisp</A> -- presents proof that cdeq and cdeq+ are equivalent
<A HREF="cdeq-phase2.lisp"cdeq-phase2.lisp</A> -- presents proof that cdeq+ and intr are equivalent
<A HREF="cdeq-phase3.lisp"cdeq-phase3.lisp</A> -- presents proof that intr and intr+ are equivalent
<A HREF="cdeq-phase4.lisp"cdeq-phase4.lisp</A> -- presents proof that intr+ is a refinement of spec

To build the books in this directory (in the correct order), perform the
following commands, or else just type <code>make</code> on a Unix or Linux
system if this directory is installed in a copy of the ACL2 distribution, under
books/workshops/2000/sumners1/cdeq/.
