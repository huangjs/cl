In the spirit of Pete & J's work reported in defpun.lisp, their
construction of a function f that satisfies the equation in the
following theorem,

(defthm generic-tail-recursive-f
  (equal (f x)
	 (if (test x) (base x) (f (st x))))),

is extended to a construction of a function f that satisfies
the equation, for certain h's, in the theorem:

(defthm generic-primitive-recursive-f
    (equal (f x)
	   (if (test x) (base x) (h x (f (st x)))))).

Three examples are included below:
  Example 1. Pete & J's cons example (modified).
  Example 2. Naive Factorial
  Example 3. Example with parameters.

 These examples each construct a function using a minor variation
 of the construction outlined in defpun.lisp for tail-recursive
 functions.

As shown by Pete & J, for some h's, such an f does not exist.
Their example, showing such an f need not exist, has 
  (test x) = (equal x 0), 
  (base x) = nil,
  (h x y$)  = (cons nil y$), and 
  (st x)   = (- x 1).

A sufficient (but not necessary) condition on h for the 
existence of f is that h have a right fixed point, i.e., there is
some c such that (h x c) = c.

An example, also due to Pete & J, showing that h having a right
fixed point is not necessary for the existence of f has
  (test x) = (equal x 0)
  (base x) = 0
  (h x y$)  = (+ 1 y$), and
  (st x)   = (- x 1).
The ACL2 function fix satisfies the recursive equation in
generic-primitive-recursive-f, for these choices for test, base,
h, and st.  Here (fix x) returns x if x is an ACL2 number and
returns 0 otherwise. 

Note:
A function f satisfying the equation
    (equal (f x)
	   (if (test x) (base x) (h x (f (st x)))))).
is called primitive recursive because a recursive equation of
this form is a generalization of the definitions by primitive 
recursion studied in computability theory:
    F(x_1,...,x_n, 0)   = k(x_1,...,x_n)
    F(x_1,...,x_n, t+1) = h(t, F(x_1,...,x_n,t), x_1,...,x_n).

No ACL2 function g satisfies this equation: 
(equal (g x)
       (if (equal x 0)
	   nil
	   (cons nil (g (- x 1)))))

The ``problem'' from the point of view of this note is that cons 
does not have a right fixed point, so one is provided by the 
following:
