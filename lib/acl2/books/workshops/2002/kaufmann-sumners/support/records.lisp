We define properties of a generic record accessor function and updater
function.  The basic functions are (g a r) and (s a v r) where a is an
address/key, v is a value, r is a record, and (g a r) returns the value set to
address a in record r, and (s a v r) returns a new record with address a set to
value v in record r.

The following main lemmas are "exported" about record (g)et and (s)et:

(defthm g-same-s
  (equal (g a (s a v r)) 
         v))

(defthm g-diff-s
  (implies (not (equal a b))
           (equal (g a (s b v r))
                  (g a r))))

(defthm s-same-g
  (equal (s a (g a r) r) 
         r))

(defthm s-same-s
  (equal (s a y (s a x r))
         (s a y r)))

(defthm s-diff-s
  (implies (not (equal a b))
           (equal (s b y (s a x r))
                  (s a x (s b y r))))
  :rule-classes ((:rewrite :loop-stopper ((b a s)))))

We also include some auxiliary lemmas which have proven useful.

(defthm access-of-nil-is-nil
  (not (g a nil)))

(defthm record-set-cannot-be-nil
  (implies v (s a v r)))

(defthm record-get-non-nil-cannot-be-nil
  (implies (g a r) r))

We normalize the record structures (which allows the 'equal-ity based rewrite
rules) as alists where the keys (cars) are ordered using the total-order added
to ACL2 and defined in the included book. We define a set of "-aux" functions
which assume well-formed records -- defined by rcdp -- and then prove the
desired properties using hypothesis assuming well-formed records.

We then remove these well-formed record hypothesis by defining an invertible
mapping (acl2->rcd) taking any ACL2 object and returning a well-formed
record. We then prove the desired properties using the proper translations of
the -aux functions to the acl2 objects, and subsequently remove the
well-formed record hypothesis.
