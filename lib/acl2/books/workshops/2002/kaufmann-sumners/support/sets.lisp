We define the common boolean operations (and a few other common useful notions)
on sets canonicalized as ordered lists using Pete's total ordering of all ACL2
objects. Further, the functions have been defined with a normalization of all
ACL2 objects as appropriate sets (we define a 1-1 function which maps any ACL2
object to a corresponding well-formed set) and using this normal (and its
inverse), we can prove properties about normalized set operations which use
equal-ity instead of set-equality and require no backtracking to relieve
well-formed set hypotheses.

EXPORTED logic functions:
   
   (in e x)      -- set membership predicate, is element e a member of set x
   (subset x y)  -- subset predicate, is set x a subset of set y
   (isect x y)   -- the set intersection of set x and set y
   (unite x y)   -- the set union of set x and set y
   (sdiff x y)   -- the set of elements in set x but not in set y
   (card x)      -- returns the number of objects in the set x
   (s1 e)        -- the singleton set consisting only of the element e
   (scar x)      -- the least (by <<) element in the set x, nil if x is empty
   ()            -- NIL is unique representative value for empty set,
                    so use NULL or NOT to test a set for emptiness

EXPORTED theorems provided at the end of this file.

I have removed all of the subgoal hints except for those introduced by the
macro defthm-ternary-sets. These subgoal hints are reasonable since they are
introduced in the context of a provided induction scheme and they help speed
the proofs through considerably by avoiding the problem in ACL2 of
free-variable matching in the application of <<-transitive.
