;;; From now on we won't assume that the ordinal embedding of a
;;; term/monomial is not zero. Instead, it will be shown that it is
;;; always possible to build a modified ordinal embedding holding this
;;; property without imposing any additional constraint. This approach
;;; has the advantage of separating two concerns: the development of
;;; monomial orderings and the development of induced polynomial
;;; orderings.
