; To introduce an arbitrary tail-recursive function we proceed in
; three steps.  First is the proof that we can admit the generic one
; argument tail recursive function.  This ``generic theorem'' is
; proved once; the proof is not redone for each new function.  Second,
; the generic theorem is used to introduce the arity one version of
; the desired function.  Third, we prove that the arity one version is
; a witness for the desired equation.

; Here is an example.  Suppose we wish to admit the tail recursive
; factorial.

; (defun trfact (n a)
;   (if (equal n 0)
;       a
;     (trfact (- n 1) (* n a))))

; We first recognize that this is probably tail recursive (without
; checking that trfact is new, that the vars are distinct, etc.
; Successful recognition produces

; (mv '((n (car x))
;       (a (cadr x)))
;     '(equal n 0)
;     'a
;     '(list (- n 1) (* n a)))

; Using the output of this check, we introduce three defuns

; (defun test1 (x)
;   (let ((n (car x))
;         (a (cadr x)))
;     (equal n 0)))

; (defun base1 (x)
;   (let ((n (car x))
;         (a (cadr x)))
;     a))

; (defun step1 (x)
;   (let ((n (car x))
;         (a (cadr x)))
;     (list (- n 1) (* n a))))

; We then use the generic theorem to introduce

; (defun trfact1 (x)
;   (if (test1 x)
;       (base1 x)
;     (trfact1 (step1 x))))

; We then define

; (defun trfact (n a)
;   (trfact1 (list n a)))

; and we prove that it satisfies the constraint

; (equal (trfact n a)
;        (if (equal n 0)
;            a
;          (trfact (- n 1) (* n a))))

; Now we write the code to do all this.

; First, we prove the generic theorem.  We use the proof Pete
; developed in his prototype implementation of defpartial but for the
; generic case.
