;;; ******************************************************
;;; ANTI-UNIFICATION: DEFINITION AND PROPERTIES.
;;; EXISTENCE OF A GLB OF TWO TERMS W.R.T. SUBSUMPTION.
;;; ******************************************************

;;; In this book:
;;; - Definition of anti-unify, a function implementing an
;;;   anti-unification algorithm.
;;; - Main properties of anti-unify, stablishing that (anti-unify t1 t2)
;;;   is the most particular common generalization of t1 and t2, thus
;;;   showing that the set of first order terms (in a given signature)
;;;   is a lower semi-lattice w.r.t. subsumption.

;;; ============================================================================
;;; 1. Definition of anti-unify-aux
;;; ============================================================================

;;; As usual, we will define anti-unification for terms and for list of
;;; terms. This is done by the function anti-unify-aux. An extra
;;; argument phi is needed to take acount of associations of the form
;;; ((s1 . s2) . x), where s1 and s2 are terms s.t. only variables are a
;;; common generalization of them, and x is a variable. We need to store
;;; this associations, since for the same pair of terms the same
;;; variable has to be assigned during the proccess.



;;; The argument phi can be seen as an "injection" from pair of terms to
;;; variables. This injection is built on demmand. That's the role of
;;; the following function. The function returns a multi-value of three:
;;; see the comments below to understand the role of the three
;;; values. Note also the use of assoc-equal.

(defun anti-unify-injection (p phi)
  (declare (xargs :guard (alistp-acl2-numberp phi)))
  (let ((found (assoc-equal p phi)))
    (if found
	(mv (cdr found) phi t)
      (let ((y (if (endp phi) 1 (+ 1 (cdar phi)))))
	(mv y (cons (cons p y) phi) t)))))

;;; The function anti-unify-aux

(defun anti-unify-aux (flg t1 t2 phi)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (term-p-aux flg t1)
			      (term-p-aux flg t2)
			      (alistp-acl2-numberp phi))
		  :verify-guards nil))
  (if flg
      (cond ((or (variable-p t1) (variable-p t2))
	     (anti-unify-injection (cons t1 t2) phi))
	    ((eql (car t1) (car t2))
	     (mv-let (anti-unify-args phi1 bool)
		     (anti-unify-aux nil (cdr t1) (cdr t2) phi)
		     (if bool
			 (mv (cons (car t1) anti-unify-args) phi1 t)
		       (anti-unify-injection (cons t1 t2) phi))))
	    (t (anti-unify-injection (cons t1 t2) phi)))
    (cond  ((endp t1) (if (eql t1 t2) (mv t1 phi t) (mv nil nil nil)))
	   ((endp t2) (mv nil nil nil))
	   (t (mv-let (anti-unify-cdr phi1 bool1)
		      (anti-unify-aux nil (cdr t1) (cdr t2) phi)
		      (if bool1
			  (mv-let (anti-unify-car phi2 bool2)
				  (anti-unify-aux t (car t1) (car t2) phi1)
				  (if bool2
				      (mv (cons anti-unify-car anti-unify-cdr)
					  phi2
					  t)
				    (mv nil nil nil)))
			(mv nil nil nil)))))))
;;; REMARKS:
;;; - Note that the function returns a multi-value with three values:
;;; the anti-unification term, the "injection" and a boolean value to
;;; indicate success or fail.
;;; - Although for terms there is always a glb for two terms (a variable
;;; in the "worst" case), the same is not true for lists of terms. Thus,
;;; we have to distinguish nil as fail for nil as a list of
;;; terms. That's the reason for the third value of the returned
;;; muti-value.

;;; OUR GOAL: To prove that the first value of the multi-value returned
;;; by (anti-unify-aux flg t1 t2 phi), when succes, it is a glb of t1 t2
;;; (under some assumptions about phi).




;;; ============================================================================
;;; 2. Definition and properties of pre-anti-unify-aux 
;;; ============================================================================

;;; INTERESTING REMARK: In a first attempt, we tried to prove the main
;;; properties of anti-unify-aux reasoning about the function definition
;;; (as usual). But it turned out difficult to manage the "incremental
;;; construction of the injection". In particular, we were not able to
;;; proof that the anti-unification is subsumed by any other common
;;; generalization. Thus, we changed our strategy: we defined
;;; pre-anti-unify-aux. In this function we suppose that the injection
;;; phi is already built. Note that anti-unify-aux returns the same term
;;; as pre-anti-unify-aux, whenever the injection finally constructed by
;;; anti-unify-aux is given to pre-anti-unify-aux initially. In this
;;; way, we have an equivalent definition of anti-unification although
;;; less eficcient, because we would need to traverse the terms twice:
;;; one for computing the injection and one for computing the
;;; anti-unification. In contrast, anti-unify-aux does this computation
;;; at the same time. But the main point here is that pre-anti-unify-aux
;;; is much more suitable for reasoning. We first prove the main
;;; properties of pre-anti-unify-aux, then we prove the relation between
;;; pre-anti-unify-aux and anti-unify-aux, and finally we export the
;;; properties of pre-anti-unify-aux to anti-unify-aux. In few words: a
;;; good example of compositional reasoning.

 (defun pre-anti-unify-aux (flg t1 t2 phi)

	     ((eql (car t1) (car t2))
	      (mv-let (anti-unify-args bool)
		      (pre-anti-unify-aux nil (cdr t1) (cdr t2) phi)
		      (if bool
			  (mv (cons (car t1) anti-unify-args) t)
			(mv (cdr (assoc (cons t1 t2) phi)) t))))
	     (t (mv (cdr (assoc (cons t1 t2) phi)) t)))
     (cond  ((endp t1) (if (eql t1 t2) (mv t1 t) (mv nil nil)))
	    ((endp t2) (mv nil nil))
	    (t (mv-let (anti-unify-cdr bool1)

				     (mv nil nil)))
			 (mv nil nil))))))))

;;; REMARK: Note the difference with anti-unify-aux: we assume the
;;; injection phi as a constant association list. 

;;; An analogue property to anti-unify-aux-bool-pair-args:

;;; the sucess or failure is independent from phi. This rule reduces the
;;; complexity of the proofs.

;;; The following function defines the properties we are going to
