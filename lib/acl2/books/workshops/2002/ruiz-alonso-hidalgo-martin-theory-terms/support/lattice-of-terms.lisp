;;; *********************************************************
;;; THE COMPLETE LATTICE OF FIRST-ORDER TERMS WITH RESPECT TO
;;; SUBSUMPTION
;;; *********************************************************

;;; We compile the results of this library about first-order terms, to
;;; prove that we can define a complete well-founded lattice
;;; w.r.t. subsumption in the set of objects of the ACL2 logic. We also
;;; prove that the set of terms of a given signature  is a sublattice.


;;; ============================================================================
;;; 1. Introducing one distinguished top term and substitution.
;;; ============================================================================


;;; ------
;;; Macros
;;; ------

;;; We will distinguish one term, called the top term:

(defmacro the-top-term ()
  ''the-top-term)

(defmacro is-the-top-term (term)
  `(equal ,term (the-top-term))) 

;;; We will distinguish one substitution, called the top substitution:

(defmacro the-top-substitution ()
  ''the-top-substitution)

(defmacro is-the-top-substitution (subst)
  `(equal ,subst (the-top-substitution)))

;;; Some previous technical definitions:


(defun fix-substitution (sigma)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (if (atom sigma) nil sigma))

;;; REMARK: This will force to every empty substitution returned 
;;; by subs to be distinct from the-top-substitution. 

(defun fix-term (term)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (if (variable-p term) 0 term))

;;; REMARK: This forces to every term returned by anti-unification and
;;; mg-instance to be distinct from the-top-term.

;;; A few technical lemmas:


(local 
 (defthm the-top-term-anti-unify-variable-p
  (implies (and (variable-p (anti-unify t1 t2))
                 (subs term t1) (subs term t2))

;;; In the following, we will state (and mechanichally prove) the
;;; properties of a well founded lattice: the set of terms w.r.t
;;; subsumption.


;;; ============================================================================
;;; 2. Terms and substitutions
;;; ============================================================================


;;; Every object can be seen as a term (see terms.lisp for details). But
;;; we can define (extended) terms of a given signature:

(defun ext-term-s-p (term)
  (or (term-s-p term) (is-the-top-term term)))

;;; For guard verification purpouses, we can define well-formed
;;; (extended) terms:

(defun ext-term-p (term)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (or (term-p term) (is-the-top-term term)))


;;; Every object can be seen as a substitution (see terms.lisp). But we
;;; can define (extended) substitutions of a given signature:


(defun ext-substitution-s-p (sigma)
  (or (substitution-s-p sigma) (is-the-top-substitution sigma)))



;;; For guard verification purpouses, we can define wel-formed
;;; (extended) substitutions:

(defun ext-substitution-p (sigma)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (or (substitution-p sigma) (is-the-top-substitution sigma)))


;;; Applying substitutions to terms
;;; (see terms.lisp)

(defun app<= (sigma term)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (ext-substitution-p sigma)
			      (ext-term-p term))))
  (if (or (is-the-top-substitution sigma)
	  (is-the-top-term term))
      (the-top-term)
    (instance term sigma)))



;;; ============================================================================
;;; 3. Subsumption relation between terms.
;;; ============================================================================

;;; (see subsumption-one-definition-and-properties.lisp for details)

(defun s<= (t1 t2)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (ext-term-p t1)
			      (ext-term-p t2))))
  (cond  ((is-the-top-term t2) t)

	 (t (subs t1 t2))))
      
(defun match<= (t1 t2)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (ext-term-p t1)
			      (ext-term-p t2))))
  (cond  ((is-the-top-term t2)

;;; Relation between app<= and subsumption 
;;; (see subsumption-one-definition-and-properties.lisp for details)

;;; If exists sigma such that t2 = (app<= sigma term), then term subsumes
;;; t2:

(defthm app<=-s<=-relationship-1

  (implies (equal t2 (app<= sigma t1))
	   (s<= t1 t2)))


;;; If t1 susbsumes t2, then exists a substitution s.t. applied to t1
;;; returns t2. That substitution is given by match<=.

  (implies (s<= t1 t2)
	   (equal (app<= (match<= t1 t2) t1) t2))

;;; Reflexivity

;;; Transitivity

;;; ============================================================================
;;; 5. s<= is well-founded
;;; ============================================================================


;;; (see subsumption-well-founded.lisp for details)


;;; The strict part of s<=

(defun s< (t1 t2)

;;; A measure on terms.

(defun measure-s< (term)

(defthm s<-well-founded 

  (implies (s< t1 t2)
	   (o< (measure-s< t1) (measure-s< t2))))

;;; REMARK:

;;; The above two lemmas implies in our meta-logic that there no
;;; infinite decreasing (w.r.t. s<) chain of terms. Thus, subsumption
;;; between first order terms is a well founded relation.


;;; ============================================================================
;;; 6. Greatest lower bound of two terms (w.r.t. s<=) 
;;; ============================================================================

;;; (see anti-unification.lisp for details)

(defun glb-s<= (t1 t2)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (ext-term-p t1) (ext-term-p t2))))

  (s<= (glb-s<= t1 t2) t2))


;;; glb-s<= is greater (or equivalent) than any lower-bound.


(defthm glb-s<=-is-greater-than-any-lower-bound 
  
  (implies (and (s<= term t1)
                (s<= term t2))
           (s<= term (glb-s<= t1 t2))))
  

;;; glb-s<= of two terms of a given signature is a term of that
;;; signature: 

(defthm glb-s<=-closure-property
  (implies (and (ext-term-s-p t1) (ext-term-s-p t2))
           (ext-term-s-p (glb-s<= t1 t2))))

;;; ============================================================================
;;; 7. Least upper bound of two terms (w.r.t. s<=) 
;;; ============================================================================
;;; (see mg-instance.lisp for details)


(defun lub-s<= (t1 t2)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (ext-term-p t1) (ext-term-p t2))))
  (cond ((or (is-the-top-term t1)
	     (is-the-top-term t2))
	 (the-top-term))
	((mg-instance t1 t2) (fix-term (mg-instance t1 t2)))
	(t (the-top-term))))

;;; lub-s<= is an upper bound of t1 y t2

(defthm lub-s<=-upper-bound-1 

  (s<= t1 (lub-s<= t1 t2)))


(defthm lub-s<=-upper-bound-2

  (s<= t2 (lub-s<= t1 t2)))


;;; lub-s<= es less (or equivalent) than any upper bound

(defthm lub-s<=-less-than-any-upper-bound 

  (implies (and (s<= t1 term)
                (s<= t2 term))
           (s<= (lub-s<= t1 t2) term)))


;;; lub-s<= of two terms of a given signature is a term of that
;;; signature:

(defthm lub-s<=-closure-property
  (implies (and (ext-term-s-p t1) (ext-term-s-p t2))
           (ext-term-s-p (lub-s<= t1 t2))))



;;; CONCLUSION:

;;; So the set of objects of ACL2 logic is well-founded lattice
;;; w.r.t. the s<= relation (in particular this implies tha it is a
;;; complete lattice). And the set of terms of a given signature is a
;;; sublattice.
