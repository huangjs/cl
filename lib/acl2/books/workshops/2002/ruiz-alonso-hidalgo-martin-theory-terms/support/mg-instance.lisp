;;; **********************************
;;; MOST GENERAL INSTANCE OF TWO TERMS
;;; **********************************

;;; We prove here that, given two terms, there exists a most
;;; general instance (if they are unifiable). We will define such most
;;; general instance in the following way:
;;; "Given t1 and t2 we rename their variables in order to get their
;;;  set of variables disjoint. Let t1' and t2' the respective renamed
;;;  versions of t1 and t2. Let sigma = (mgu t1' t2') (if  they are
;;;  unifiable). Then sigma(t1') is a more general instantiation (a
;;;  least upper bound w.r.t. subsumption) of t1 and t2. If t1' and t2'
;;;  are not unifiable, there are no common instance of t1 and t2."

;;; GOAL. In this section we want to prove: 

;;; * If (second (mg-instance-mv t1 t2)), then:
;;;    (1) and (2): (first (mg-instance-mv t1 t2)) is a common instance of 
;;;        (number-rename t1 1 1) and (number-rename t2 0 -1).
;;;    (4): (first (mg-instance-mv t1 t2)) is a most general instance of 
;;;         (number-rename t1 1 1) and (number-rename t2 0 -1).

;;; * If (not (second (mg-instance-mv t1 t2))):
;;;    (3): There are no common instance of (number-rename t1 1 1) and 
;;;         (number-rename t2 0 -1).  


;;; IMPORTANT REMARK: Since we are going to work with renamed terms,
;;; we disable  renamed-implies-iff-subs-1 and renamed-implies-iff-subs-2

;;; 2.3 Disjoint union of two substitution: definition and main property
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


;;; ====== DISJOINT-UNION-SUBST 
;;; Given two terms t1 and t2 and two substitutions sigma1 and sigma2 , 
;;; we append the restriction of sigma1 and sigma2 to the variables of
;;; (number-rename t1 0 -1) and (number-rename t2 1 1)

(local 
 (defun disjoint-union-subst (sigma1 sigma2 t1 t2)
   (append (restriction sigma1 (variables t (number-rename t1 0 -1)))
	   (restriction sigma2 (variables t (number-rename t2 1 1))))))


;;;; Main property of (disjoint-union-subst sigma1 sigma2 t1 t2): 
;;; (disjoint-union-subst sigma1 sigma2 t1 t2) is an unifier of t1r and t2r.

(local
 (defthm disjoint-union-subst-unifier 
  (implies (equal (instance (number-rename t1 0 -1) sigma1)
		  (instance (number-rename t2 1 1) sigma2))
	   (equal (instance (number-rename t2 1 1)
			    (disjoint-union-subst sigma1 sigma2 t1 t2))
		  (instance (number-rename t1 0 -1)
			    (disjoint-union-subst sigma1 sigma2 t1 t2))))))





;;; REMARK: Strategy in the following to prove (3) and (4):

;;; Let t1r = (number-rename t1 0 -1) and t2r = (number-rename t2 1 1):

;;; If term is an upper bound of t1r and t2r, we have to prove that
;;; (first (mg-instance-mv t1 t2)) subsumes term (whenever
;;; (second (mg-instance-mv t1 t2)) 

;;; We will prove it 
;;; - (first (mg-instance-mv t1 t2)) is (instance t1r unifier) and 
;;; - term is (instance t1r sigma12 )
;;;   where sigma12 is the disjoint union of the two matching substitution
;;;   for t1r and term and t2r and term, respectively.
;;; - sigma12 is an unifier of t1r and t2r, so unifier subsumes sigma12
;;;   using the lemma subs-sust-main-property (see
;;;   subsumption-subst.lisp)
