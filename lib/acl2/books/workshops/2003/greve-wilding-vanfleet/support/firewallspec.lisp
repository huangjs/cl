;; Essay on formalizing "black" data.

;; This file introduces some concepts useful in specifying a firewall.
;; It was not immediately obvious how to formalize the correct
;; operation of a firewall.  What makes it difficult is describing
;; what it means for data not to contain sensitive information.  We
;; introduce the notion of "black", which is a predicate on a segment
;; name and a system state.  The intended interpretation is that black
;; segments do not contain sensitive information that requires
;; protection.

;; Mostly we leave "black" unspecified.  However, we assume that it
;; has the following properties:

;; 1.  If all segments in a system are black, then after the system
;;     progresses one step each segment is black.  (No "spontaneous
;;     generation".)

;; 2.  There exists a function "scrub" that modifies a segment so 
;;     that it is black.  

;; 3.  Elements of system state that are not associated with the
;;     segment are irrelevant in deciding whether a segment is black.

;; Is this approach to modeling reasonable?  Assume that each byte of
;; the system has associated with it a "black" bit that tells whether
;; the byte is cleared.  Any operation that produces data sets the
;; result's black bit to the "and" of all the input black bits.

;; Axiom one holds, since any operation will set black bits if every
;; segment in the system has its black bits set.  Note that
;; applications are not modeled at this level, but it is worth
;; considering whether this framework could model something like a
;; decryption algorithm.  Note that decryption requires keys or
;; algorithms that would not be considered "black" in this framework,
;; so this axiom would not be inconsistent with such models.

;; Axiom two holds since one can "scrub" a data segment by zeroizing
;; all the data and setting the black bits.  (Of course, not under
;; user control.)

;; Axiom three holds since it is straightforward to tell if a segment
;; is black by checking all its black bits.
