#| fair1.lisp

This "book" provides an equivalence proof between a straightforward statement
of "fair input selection" using defun-sk and the existence of a fair measure
function which decreases with every step. In order to use the measure function
introduced in this book, one would need to introduce (fair-selection)
assumptions in any theorems which required the properties of the environment
measure function. Because of this, we do not recommend using this book, and
instead recommend using the book fair2.lisp.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

We include an extra "k" parameter to the functions env and env-measure, to
allow the use of multiple independent fair selectors. We generally use the
following macro define-env to define a fair environment with support for
multiple fair selectors for "fields" in an input. These "fields" of the input
are defined using the "s" and "g" operators from the records book:
books/misc/records.lisp. These operators could be replaced with updaters and
accessors of your choosing, but the properties of "s" and "g" should hold (or
suitable equivalent properties) and "g" should be a free accessor in that the
range of "g" should be the ACL2 universe. This is necessary to ensure that the
modeling of the fair selector is not inadvertently and inappropriately
constrained.

We conclude this book with a "proof" that the existence of a fair-measure
implies (fair-selection) -- we proved the other direction above. This other
direction is not relevant to the output of this file, so we make all of the
following forms local.
