 fast.lisp

  The MBE feature in ACL2 version 2.8 provides the opportunity to
  introduce functions which take advantage of the set order for good
  execution efficiency, while still using simple/nice functions for
  reasoning about.  

  This file contains efficient versions of the union, intersect, and
  difference functions, and a few theorems about them.  The goal is
  to show that for each of these "fast" functions, when given two 
  sets as inputs:

    (1) produces a set, and
    (2) has the correct membership properties

  These facts can then be used to make an equal-by-membership argu-
  ment with the simple versions as required by MBE. 

  Note that this file is very ugly.  There are many factors that con-
  tribute to this problem.  For one, these functions are written in
  terms of cons and therefore we have to consider many cases.  This 
  also means we have lots of subgoals when we do inductions.  It is
  also challenging to develop a "good" rewrite theory when it comes
  to the cons function, which does not have very nice properties when
  related to sets.
