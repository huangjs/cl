 sort.lisp

   We implement a mergesort which can convert lists into sets more
   efficiencly than repeated insertion.  Logically, (mergesort x) 
   is exactly the same as repeated insertion, so it is fairly easy
   to reason about.  But, under the hood, mergesort is implemented
   fairly efficiently using MBE.

   The sort we implement is probably not "blisteringly fast".  Most
   of the literature on the subject suggests using a bubblesort when
   we get down to some threshold, say 40 elements.  I'm not going to
   bother with any of that.  If you find that the mergesort's perfor-
   mance is inadequate, which is unlikely, you can work on making it
   faster.

   There are a few points of interest.  If you look at the actual 
   sort code (mergesort-exec), you will see that it is actually using
   the set library's own union function to perform the union.  This
   is pretty slick because union is linear complexity, and yet is 
   easy to reason about since we have already got a lot of theory in
   place about it.

   In any case, our strategy for proving the equality of this merge-
   sort with a simple insert-sort is the exact same trick we use 
   everywhere else in the sets library.  We begin by showing that 
   both produce sets, and then show that membership in either is 
   true exactly when an element is member-equal in the original list.

; A List Membership Function
;
; The current member-equal function has weird semantics, returning a
; list rather than a boolean value.  We provide a convenient
; alternative which always returns t or nil instead.
;
; We don't try to develop a complete theory for this function here,
; but we will provide several useful utility theorems for relating in
; with the common list functions such as cons, append, and reverse.
; In the future we might want to expand this section to include more
; theorems.
