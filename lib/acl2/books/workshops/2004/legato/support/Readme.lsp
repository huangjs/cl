 (:TITLE "Generic Theories as Proof Strategies: A Case Study for Weakest Precondition Style Proofs")
 (:AUTHOR/S "Wilfred Legato")
 (:KEYWORDS "Program Verification" "Weakest Preconditions" "Generic Theories"
	    "Proof Strategies" "NQTHM" "Assembly Language")
 (:ABSTRACT
  "This book demonstrates the use of generic theories to structure program
 correctness proofs using weakest preconditions.  Comparisons of NQTHM and ACL2
 arithmetic proof libraries on four different approaches to verifying programs with
 loops is included.")
