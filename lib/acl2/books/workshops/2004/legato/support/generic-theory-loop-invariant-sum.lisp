;;; The following program sums the integers from 1 to N on the early Mostek
;;; 6502 microprocessor.  A is an 8-bit wide accumulator. N is a single byte
;;; of data in memory.  C is a carry flag.  We prove that the limited (8-bit)
;;; precision computation delivers the correct result, provided N*(N+1)/2
;;; is less than 256 and N is greater than 0.
 
;;;       LDA #0     ; load A immediate with the constant 0
;;;       CLC        ; clear the carry flag
;;; LOOP  ADC N      ; add with carry N to A
;;;       DEC N      ; decrement N
;;;       BNE LOOP   ; branch if N is non-zero to LOOP
 
;;; Provide semantics for the 6502 DEC instruction.
