This is a set of macros for relating an abstract system and a concrete
system with a WEB.  The systems are deterministic.

Compare with macro.old.lisp, which was a first attempt and which
motivated the defun-weak-sk macro.

I should use a macro to customize the names of theorems.

(defun bor-macro (lst)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (if (consp lst)
      (if (consp (cdr lst))
	  (list 'if
		(car lst)
		t
		(bor-macro (cdr lst)))
	(car lst))
    nil))

(defmacro bor (&rest args)
  (bor-macro args))

; The reason for the bor macro is that (or a b) gets expanded to (if a
; a b).  This results in extra rewriting in many situations.  bor is
; equivalent to or if all the arguments are booleans.

; Generate-Full-System is given abs-step, the function that steps the
; abstract system for one step, abs-p, the predicate that recognizes
; abstract states, con-step, the function that steps the concrete
; system for one step, con-p, the predicate that recognizes concrete
; states, and con-rank, the rank of a concrete state.  Note that I am
; assuming that the step of abstract and concrete states depends only
; on the state.  There may be situations in which this is not the
; case.  If so, these macros will have to be altered somewhat.  Also,
; I am assuming that the rank of abstract states is 0.  This may also
; not be the case in general.  R, B, rank, and take-appropriate-step
; should be undefined.
