  defcoerce.lisp
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Author: Sandip Ray
Date: 12/10/2004

This book implements a macro suggested by John Matthews (and described
and implemented independently by me and John/Daron for the ACL2
workshop. The idea is to define a macro defcoerce that takes a stobj
and returns two functions copy-from and copy-to so that each is
identity in the logic, but has the property that copy-from returns an
ordinary object while copy-to returns a single-threaded object by
copying the fields of the ordinary object. This has been used by
John/Daron in implementing symbolic verification of sequential
programs and by me in implementing defpun-exec with stobjs. (The
defpun-exec book with stobjs here does not use the defcoerce
macro, since that book is still messy.

Acknowledgements:

1. Thanks to John Matthews for suggesting the idea of defcoerce.
2. Thanks to the referees in the workshop for suggesting that I
implement it.

Known issues:

1. The macro does not work for stobjs with no array field at all. (In
the defpun-exec with defcoerce I dont use the macro unless there is
some array field, which is why the negligence.) 

2.It also does not work with types T for arrays. I think I will be
able to handle that soon. But so far I have not done it.

Note on the implementation:

My implementation is different from the one that John and Daron have
done. (This is based on my impression reading their paper, but not
looking at their code, so I might be a little off.) The key point in
my implementation is the use of functional instantiation on generic
theorems. For arrays in particular, it is often nice to show that the
nth i of the array is the same as that in the copy. I regularly take
this approach to show that an array is equal to the copy. In this
work, therefore, I take the opportunity to define such generic set of
theorems and show how to functionally instantiate them. Admittedly I
need a lot of theorems in the macro. I should have just gone for an
inductive proof over update-nth. However, there is a certain amount of
elegance in the functional instantiation stuff that I like, and also I
think this is one thing that ACL2 users should use more often. Thus I
am inclined to do it this way. Also I think this way makes the macro
more robust (although as they say the taste of the pudding....:->)

;; We use some arithmetic books. As is customary with me in recent 
;; days, I will simply use Robert's arithmetic-2 library.

;; The only real issue in defining the functions copy-from and copy-to
;; are in handling arrays. So I will simply focus on this case for
;; now.

;; Defining the functions copy-from-stor and copy-to-stor requires several
;; theorems between nth and update-nth. I use the version of these theorems
;; that I have used for the verification of a stobj-based quicksort.
