;;; 0) Introducción
;;;
;;;============================================================================

;;;   We discuss a representation for term graphs, using lists and we define
;;; the notion of directed acyclic graphs, proving its main properties. We also
;;; describe and prove a way of recursively traversing term dags.

;;;   More precisely, in this book:

;;; *) 
;;;   We define a representation for term graphs, {\em using lists}. 
;;; *) 
;;;   We define a predicate {\tt dag-p}, the property of being acyclic (a dag).
;;; *)
;;;   We prove the main properties of that definition.
;;; *)
;;;   We also prove a property about directed acyclic graphs that become
;;;   cyclic when one of its nodes is changed in a certain way.
;;; *) 
;;;   We define a measure function that will be used to admit functions
;;;   that traverse dags in a way that resembles recursion on 
;;;   first order terms represented as lists in preffix notation. 
;;; *)
;;;   We prove the corresponding termination conjectures.   
;;; -)

;;;   The results in this book will be translated to an analogue representation
;;; of term-dags using stobjs, that will be used to compute. I feel more
;;; comfortable working with lists than working with stobjs (which requires
;;; more technical details), so I prefer to stay in the "logical side" and
;;; translate the main events later.

;;;============================================================================
;;;
;;; 1) Representation of term graphs
;;;
;;;============================================================================

;;;   We represent a (directed) term graph as a list. If @g@ is a list
;;; representing a term graph, {\tt (nth x g)} stores a symbol (function or
;;; variable) and information about the neighbors of the node @x@.

;;;   There are two kinds of nodes: function nodes and variable nodes.
;;; Depending on the kind of a node @h@, we will store in {\tt (nth h g)} the
;;; following information:

;;; *) 
;;;   Variable nodes. They can be of two forms:
;;; *.*) 
;;;              @N@ (integer numbers): bound variables. They are bound to
;;;              the node @N@ (note that negative numbers are interpreted
;;;              w.r.t. @nth@ as 0). I will call this nodes "IS" nodes.
;;; *.*)
;;;              {\tt (X . T)} : they represent an unbound variable 
;;;              @X@. I will call these nodes "VARIABLES".
;;; *.-)
;;; *)
;;;   Non-variable nodes (function nodes): {\tt (F. L)} (where @L@ is
;;;   different from @T@), interpreted as the function symbol @F@ and the
;;;   list @L@ of its neighbors (its arguments). These are "NON-VARIABLE"
;;;   nodes.   
;;; -)

;;;   Examples:

;;;   Graph representing the term $f(h(x), h(y), k(l(x,y)))$:
; ((F 1 3 5) (H 2) (X . T) (H 4) (Y . T) (K 6) (L 7 8) 2 4)

;;;   Graph representing the term $f(h(x,x), h(y,y), k(l(x,y)))$:
; ((F 1 4 7) (H 2 3) (X . T) 2 (H 5 6) (Y . T) 5 (K 8) (L 9 10) 2 5)

;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; 1.1) Term graphs
;;;
;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;;   The following function defines {\em term graphs}. That is, lists having
;;; the expected contents: indices -or- @nil@ -or- pairs of symbol functions
;;; and a bounded true list of indices -or- pairs of variable symbol and the
;;; symbol @t@ (see {\tt dags.lisp} for details). Note that we also require
;;; that the symbols (functions and variables) have to be eqlablep. The first
;;; function @term-graph-p-aux@ also takes as argument the bound for the
;;; indices. As a particular case, the function @term-graph-p@ is defined as a
;;; particular case when the bound is the length of the graph.

(defun bounded-term-graph-p (g n)
  (declare (xargs :guard (natp n)))
  (if (atom g)
;      (equal g nil)
      t
      (and (or (equal (car g) nil)
	       (and (natp (car g)) (< (car g) n))
	       (and (consp (car g))
		    (eqlablep (caar g))
		    (or (equal (cdar g) t)
			(bounded-nat-true-listp (cdar g) n))))
	   (bounded-term-graph-p (cdr g) n))))

(defun term-graph-p (g)
   (declare (xargs :guard t))
   (bounded-term-graph-p g (len g)))

;;;   Some properties about the contents:

(defthm bounded-term-graph-p-main-property
  (implies (and (bounded-term-graph-p g n)
		(< h (len g)))
	   (or (equal (nth h g) nil)
	       (and (natp (nth h g)) (< (nth h g) n))
	       (and (consp (nth h g))
		    (eqlablep (car (nth h g)))
		    (or (equal (cdr (nth h g)) t)
			(bounded-nat-true-listp (cdr (nth h g)) n)))))
  :rule-classes :forward-chaining)

(defthm bounded-term-graph-p-nth-property-1
  (implies (and (bounded-term-graph-p g n)
		(integerp (nth h g)))
	   (<= 0 (nth h g)))
  :rule-classes :linear)

(defthm bounded-term-graph-p-nth-property-2
  (implies (and (bounded-term-graph-p g n)
		(integerp (nth h g)))
	   (< (nth h g) n)))

(defthm term-graph-p-main-property
  (implies (and (bounded-term-graph-p g n)
		(< h (len g))
		(not (natp (nth h g)))
		(not (consp (nth h g))))
	   (not (nth h g))))

;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; 1.2) Neighbors
;;;
;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;;   A graph will be represented as a list @G@ with the sequence of that
;;; information. This means that the neighbors of node @N@ and eventually its
;;; variable or function symbol is in {\tt (nth N G)}. We will say that a node
;;; of a graph @G@ is {\em important} if it is a natural number less than the
;;; length of the list @G@.

;;;   The following function computes the neighbors of a node @h@ in a graph
;;; @G@:
  
(defun neighbors (h g)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (natp h)
			      (true-listp g)
			      (term-graph-p g)
			      (< h (len g)))))
  (let ((ng (nth h g)))
    (if (integerp ng)
	(list ng)
	(let ((ngs (cdr ng)))
	  (if (equal ngs t) nil ngs)))))

;;;   REMARK: As usual, every ACL2 object can be seen as a term graph.
;;; Moreover, since neighbors are determined by the behaviour of the function
;;; @nth@, every ACL2 has a list of neighbors (possibly empty) w.r.t. to a term
;;; graph. In particular, non-natural nodes has the same list of neighbors than
;;; the node @0@. Natural nodes geater than the length of @g@ have an empty
;;; list of neighbors (they can be seen as the constant @(nil)@).

(defthm neighbors-bounded-nat-true-listp
  (implies (and (bounded-term-graph-p g n)
		(natp h)
		(< h (len g)))
	   (bounded-nat-true-listp (neighbors h g) n))
  :hints (("Goal" :expand (neighbors h g))))

;;;============================================================================
;;;
;;; 2) Directed acyclic (term) graphs
;;;
;;;============================================================================

;;;   We now define a predicate checking that a given term graph has no cyclic
;;; paths. A term graph with this property is called a dag (directed acyclic
;;; graph).

;;;   We are going to define a function @dag-p@, inspired in "An exercise in
;;; graph theory", J Moore \cite{moore-graph}. The main auxiliary function to
;;; define this function is called @dag-p-aux@, and will be defined in the
;;; following way:

; (defun dag-p-aux (hs rev-path g)
;   (declare (xargs :measure (measure-dag-p hs rev-path g)))
;   (if (endp hs)
;       t
;     (let ((hs-car (nfix (car hs))))
;       (if (member hs-car rev-path)
; 	  nil
; 	(and (dag-p-aux (neighbors (car hs) g)
; 			(cons hs-car rev-path)
; 			g)
; 	     (dag-p-aux (cdr hs) rev-path g))))))


;;;   In this definition, @g@ is a term graph, @hs@ is a stack of nodes that
;;; remains to be explored and @rev-path@ contains a path (in reverse order)
;;; with nodes already visited. This recursive schema is inspired in the one
;;; given in J Moore's paper.

;;;   If {\tt (list-of-n $n$)} is a function returning the list of natural
;;; numbers less than $n$ (it will be defined later), then our function @dag-p@
;;; will be defined simply as:

; (defun dag-p (g)
;   (dag-p-aux (list-of-n (len g)) nil g))
 
;;; Examples:

; ACL2 !>(dag-p '((F 1 3 5) (H 2) (X . T) (H 4) (Y . T) (K 6) (L 7 8) 2 4))
; T
; ACL2 !>(dag-p '((F 1 3 5) (H 2) 1 (H 4) (Y . T) (K 6) (L 7 8) 2 4))
; NIL

;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; 2.1) Termination of {\tt dag-p-aux} 
;;;
;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;;   Note that the termination of {\tt dag-p-aux} is not trivial, because of
;;; the different behaviour of the two recursive calls. So we are going to
;;; define a measure needed to admit the function. This measure will also be
;;; used later, to justify the termination of other functions.
 
;;; REMARK:

;;; 1) 
;;;   Note that cycle detection in {\tt dag-p-aux} is done "modulo
;;;   nfix". Non natural nodes are transformed to 0. 
;;; -)

;;;   So our goal is to define a measure {\tt measure-dag-p}, and show the
;;; following termination conjectures, which will allow the admission of the
;;; above function:

; (AND (O-P (MEASURE-DAG-P HS REV-PATH G))
;      (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP HS))
;                    (NOT (MEMBER (NFIX (CAR HS)) REV-PATH)))
;               (O< (MEASURE-DAG-P (NEIGHBORS (CAR HS) G)
;                                        (CONS (NFIX (CAR HS)) REV-PATH)
;                                        G)
;                         (MEASURE-DAG-P HS REV-PATH G)))
;      (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP HS))
;                    (NOT (MEMBER (NFIX (CAR HS)) REV-PATH))
;                    (DAG-P-AUX (NEIGHBORS (CAR HS) G)
;                               (CONS (NFIX (CAR HS)) REV-PATH)
;                               G))
;               (O< (MEASURE-DAG-P (CDR HS) REV-PATH G)
;                         (MEASURE-DAG-P HS REV-PATH G)))).

;;;   This measure will be a lexicographic combination of:

;;; *)
;;;   The number of important nodes that are not in rev-path .
;;; *) 
;;;   The length of @hs@.
;;; -)

;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; 2.2)  Definition of dag-p
;;;
;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;;;   We will say that a directed term graph is acyclic (a dag), if it has no
;;; cycles starting in an important node. We do not have to worry about the
;;; rest of the nodes. If they are natural numbers greater than the length of
;;; the list representing the graph, they are nodes without neighbors. If they
;;; are not natural numbers, the behave as the node 0.

;;;   First we define and characterize the list of natural numbers between 0
;;; and n:

(defun list-of-n (n)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (integerp n) (>= n 0))))
  (if (zp n)
      nil
      (cons (1- n) (list-of-n (1- n)))))

(defthm bounded-natp-list-of-n
  (implies (natp n)
	   (iff (member x (list-of-n n))
		(bounded-natp x n))))

(include-book "lists")

  :hints ((conjunctive-extension-true-list
	   (list-of-n n)
	   (lambda (elt) (bounded-natp elt n))
	   (lambda (lst) (bounded-nat-true-listp lst n)))))

(in-theory (disable list-of-n))

;;;   Finally, the definition {\tt dag-p}:

(defun dag-p (g)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (true-listp g) (term-graph-p g))))
  (dag-p-aux (list-of-n (len g)) nil g))

;;;============================================================================
;;;
;;; 3) Verification of {\tt dag-p}
;;;
;;;============================================================================
  
;;;   Our goal is to prove that {\tt (dag-p g)} if and only if {\tt g} is
;;; cycle-free.

;;; -----------------------------------
;;;
;;; 3.1)  Definition of path and cycles
;;;
;;; -----------------------------------

;;; We define that relation between neigbors nodes in a graph:

(defun rel-graph (x y g)
  (member y (map-nfix (neighbors x g))))


;;; The following function defines the notion of path in a term graph:

(defun path-p (p g)
  (cond ((endp p) (equal p nil))
	((endp (cdr p)) (and (natp (car p)) (equal (cdr p) nil)))
	(t (and
	    (natp (first p))
	    (rel-graph (first p) (second p) g)
	    (path-p (cdr p) g)))))

;;; REMARK: Note that this definition of path differs slightly form the
;;; definition of Moore: paths are sequences of natural numbers. We use
;;; {\tt map-nfix} to transform non-natural nodes to node 0.


;;; An interesting property about concatenation of paths (taken from
;;; J's work):

(defthm path-p-append
  (implies (and (true-listp p1)
		(true-listp p2))
	   (iff (path-p (append p1 p2) g)
		(cond ((endp p1) (path-p p2 g))
		      ((endp p2) (path-p p1 g))
		      (t (and (path-p p1 g)
			      (path-p p2 g)
			      (rel-graph (car (last p1)) (car p2) g)))))))

;;; A cycle is a path with no duplicate nodes:

(defun cycle-p (p g)
  (and (path-p p g)
       (not (no-duplicatesp p))))




;;; -----------------------------------
;;;
;;; 3.1)  Soundness of {\tt dag-p}
;;;
;;; -----------------------------------

;;; We want to prove that {\tt (not (dag-p g))} implies the existence of
;;; a cycle. We have to give this cycle explicitly, defined by the below
;;; function {\tt one-cyclic-path}, whose main auxiliary function is the
;;; following: 

(defun cyclic-path-aux (hs rev-path g)
  (declare (xargs :measure (measure-dag-p hs rev-path g)))
  (if (endp hs)
      nil
    (let ((hs-car (nfix (car hs))))
      (if (member hs-car rev-path)
	  (revlist (cons hs-car rev-path))
	(or (cyclic-path-aux (neighbors (car hs) g)
			     (cons hs-car rev-path)
			   g)
	    (cyclic-path-aux (cdr hs) rev-path g))))))


(defun one-cyclic-path (g)

;;; 4) Dags that become cyclic when updated
;;; 
;;; ============================================================================
;;; For this section, we temporarily enable neighbors

(local (in-theory (enable neighbors)))

;;; We prove in this section that when an acyclicic graph becomes cyclic
;;; after updating some node @x@ with an "is" value @h@, then necessarily
;;; in the original graph there was a path from the node @h@ to the node
;;; @x@. More precisely, our goal is to prove the following theorem:

;(defthm obtain-path-from-h-to-x-from-an-updated-dag-main-property
;  (let ((p* (obtain-path-from-h-to-x-from-an-updated-dag x h g)))
;    (implies (and (natp x) (natp h) (dag-p g)
;		  (not (dag-p (update-nth x h g))))
;	   (and (path-p p* g)
;		(equal (first p*) h) (equal (car (last p*)) x))))

;;; This means that we have {\em to define} the function {\tt
;;; obtain\--path\--from-h-to-x\--from-an-updated\--dag} and {\em prove} the above
;;; theorem about the function. This result will be used in the book
;;; {\tt dag\--unification\--rules\-.lisp}, to show that the {\tt ELIMINATE}
;;; rule of the unification transformation preserves the {\tt dag-p}
;;; property. 

;;; The intuitive idea is the following: given a cycle in the updated
;;; graph, we can obtain a symple cycle (a path with no duplicate nodes
;;; in which only the last and the first element are neighbors).
;;; Necesarilly the node @x@ is in that path (since, otherwise, it would
;;; be a path in the original graph). Thus, in that path, the node
;;; following @x@ is @h@. We can therefore concatenate the nodes after
;;; @h@ with the nodes before @x@ to obtain a path from @h@ to @x@. And
;;; since in that path @x@ only appear as the last node, then it is a
;;; path in the original graph.

;;; ============================================================================
;;;
;;; 5) A measure function for traversing dags
;;; 
;;; ============================================================================

;;; We will need to define functions on dags that traverse the graph in
;;; the same recursive fashion than functions acting on terms
;;; represented using lists. Unlike terms represented as lists, this
;;; functions may not terminate in general, although this is not the
;;; case for dags.


;;; Defining functions on dags using the same recursive schema than the
;;; corresponding function on terms in prefix notation will be essential
;;; for compositional reasoning, allowing us to translate properties
;;; from the prefix case to the dags case. 

;;; For example, this will be a typical recursive definition on dags: 


; (defun occur-check-l (flg x h g)
;   (declare (xargs :measure (measure-rec-dag flg h g)))
;   (if (dag-p g)
;       (if flg
;   	  (let ((p (term-dagi-l h g)))
; 	    (if (integerp p)
; 		(occur-check-l flg x p g)
; 	      (let ((args (cdr p)))
; 		(if (equal args t)
; 		    (= x h)
; 		  (occur-check-l nil x args g)))))
; 	(if (endp h)
; 	    nil
; 	  (or (occur-check-l t x (car h) g)
; 	      (occur-check-l nil x (cdr h) g))))
;    t))



;;; So we now define a measure called {\tt measure-rec-dag} for
;;; aceppting this type of recursive definitions.
 
;;; The idea is simple: we define  the number of nodes that can be
;;; reached in a dag starting from the nodes in a given list of
;;; nodes. If we detect a cycle, we return 0. The cycle detection is
;;; done as in the previous functions. This measure is a good choice
;;; except when @flg@ is @nil@ and we recurse on a list of dags. But in
;;; this case, we can compare the {\tt acl2-count} of the list:


(defun dag-nodes-aux (hs rev-path g)
  (declare (xargs :measure (measure-dag-p hs rev-path g)))
  (if (endp hs)
      0
    (let ((hs-car (nfix (car hs))))
      (if (member hs-car  rev-path)
	  0   ;; cycle detected
	(let ((nodes-car (dag-nodes-aux
			  (neighbors (car hs) g)
			  (cons hs-car rev-path)
			  g))
	      (nodes-cdr (dag-nodes-aux (cdr hs) rev-path g)))
	  (+ 1 nodes-car nodes-cdr))))))

(defun dag-nodes (hs g)
  (dag-nodes-aux hs nil g))


(local (in-theory (enable neighbors)))

;;; That is the measure we want to define (lexicographic combination of
;;; numbers of nodes and the {\tt acl2-count} of @hs@)

(defun measure-rec-dag (flg h g)
  (if (dag-p g)
      (if flg
	  (list* (cons 1 (1+ (dag-nodes (list h) g))) (acl2-count h))
	(list* (cons 1 (1+ (dag-nodes h g))) (acl2-count h)))
    0))



;;; ============================================================================
;;;
;;; 6) Termination conjectures about {\tt measure-rec-dag}
;;; 
;;; ============================================================================

;;; Some useful macros to improve readability:

(defmacro term-dag-is-p (x g)
  `(integerp (nth ,x ,g)))

(defmacro term-dag-variable-p (x g)
  `(equal (cdr (nth ,x ,g)) t))

(defmacro term-dag-non-variable-p (x g)
  `(and (not (term-dag-is-p ,x ,g))
        (not (term-dag-variable-p ,x ,g))))
  
(defmacro term-dag-symbol (x g)
  `(car (nth ,x ,g)))

(defmacro term-dag-args (x g)
  `(cdr (nth ,x ,g)))

;;; So our goal is to prove the following theorems about {\tt measure-rec-dag}:

;;; 6.1)  An important lemma about {\tt dag-p}
;;;
;;; ------------------------------------------


;;; Before we prove the above theorems, let us prove that under the
;;; hypothesis {\tt (dag-p g)}, we have {\tt (dag-p-aux hs nil g)} for
;;; all @hs@. Note that this is not a trivial property, since {\tt
;;; (dag-p g)} only ensures that for a specific list of nodes (the nodes
;;; from 1 to the length of @g@), in a given order, the graph is
;;; cycle-free. But nothing is said about the rest of nodes and about
;;; lists in an arbitrary order. Note also the role of the second
;;; argument, since it is changed  in every recursive call.

;;; The proof strategy will be the following:

;;; 1)
;;;  We will prove that {\tt dag-p-aux} is preserved in subsets.
;;; 2)
;;;  We will prove that {\tt dag-p-aux} is preserved in append.
;;; 3)
;;;  Every @hs@ can be included as a subset of a concatenation containing
;;;  the important nodes (for these nodes we have @dag-p-aux@ by
;;;  hypothesis) plus the natural numbers greater (they don't have
;;;  neighbors and trivially satisfies @dag-p-aux@) plus the non-naturals
;;;  (they behave like 0, which is in one of the previos pieces). 
;;; -)

;;; For these two last theorems, @hs@ and @rp@ have to be disjoint.
