(in-package "BAG")

;BOZO eventually, our rules will be about these names:
(defmacro bag-insert (a x) (cons a x))
(defmacro bag-sum (x y) (append x y))

(defmacro bagp (x) (declare (ignore x)) t)

;We have tried to follow the convention that elements are letters from the start of the alphabet (a,b,c) and bags
;are letters from the end of the alphabet (x,y,z).

;(include-book "../lists/lists") ;bags are based on lists (we might change that later, though)
