Eric,

  Following are some example problems:

;Look through the clause for a (non-negated) literal of the form 
;(memberp a BLAH) where BLAH syntactically contains b.
;or a (non-negated) literal of the form:
;(memberp b BLAH) where BLAH syntactically contains a.
;If such a literal is found, return it.  The (non-negated) presence of that literal in the clause
;essentially means that we have a hypotheses which is the negation of that literal, e.g., (not (memberp a BLAH)).
;where BLAH syntactically contains b. In this case, a and b can't be equal.
;If not such literal is found, return nil.

In general:

  I would suggest: if neither a nor b appear as
an argument to member in the hypothesis, 
wrap them in a list and pass them to the
disjoint computation.

  If one does appear as an argument to a member
in the hypothesis (memberp a x), try to establish the
disjointness of the other from the list argument of
member.
