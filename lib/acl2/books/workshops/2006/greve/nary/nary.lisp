;;
;; ACL2 provides support for congruence-based rewriting.  This allows
;; ACL2 to treat certain equivalence relations "just like equality"
;; under appropriate conditions, and allows certain propositional
;; statements to be used as rewrite rules to guide the simplification
;; process.  This capability can be very powerful and quite addictive.
;;
;; Unfortunately ACL2's implementation of equivalences/congruences is
;; very restricted.  Perhaps the most significant restriction is the
;; fact that the equivalence relations must be binary. This fact
;; precludes perhaps the most natural application of congruence: its
;; use in modular arithmetic.
;;
;; There has been some reluctance on the part of the ACL2 developers
;; to generalize equivalence relations.  Messing around with such a
;; fundamental aspect of the theorem prover is, without question, a
;; daunting prospect.  One must also consider overall performance:
;; what impact on performance would be acceptable, given that such
;; generality (although powerful) is used so rarely.
;;
;; Below are some thoughts on how ACL2's current capabilities could be
;; extended to better support more arbitrary notions of congruence.
;; The primary thrust of this discussion involves how one might
;; generalize the concept of congruence by extending ACL2's notion of
;; a rewriting context.
;; 
;; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
;;
;; ACL2 already has a simple notion of rewriting context: the rewriter
;; modifies its behavior depending on the equivalence relation being
;; satisfied at the time.  In other words, the currently active
;; equivalence relation defines the context.  A more general context
;; might be one that involved, not just a particular function symbol,
;; but some number of terms.  In the case of mod, this additional term
;; might include the modulus.  The rewriter would then be capable of
;; pushing this context in to terms that it was rewriting, enabling it
;; to detect simplifications that might otherwise be too difficult to
;; detect using only simple rewrite rules.
;; 
;; Currently the specification of a new equivalence relation can be
;; used to extend ACL2's notion of equivalence, .
;;
;; (defequiv (set-equal x y))
;;
;; In order to extend ACL2's context rewriting capability, one might
;; define a new function context:
;;
;; (defcontext (mod x n) 1)
;; 
;; This tells the rewriter that (mod _ n) is a valid rewriting
;; context.  Now, any time the rewriter encounters a term of the form
;; (mod x n), it knows that x can be rewritten in a (mod _ n) context.
;;
;; Extending ACL2's notion of congruence requires that one prove
;; the following rule:
;;
;; (defcong set-equal set-equal (set-insert x y) 2)
;;
;; Which results in the following obligation:
;;
;; (implies 
;;  (set-equal y y-equiv) 
;;  (set-equal (set-insert x y) 
;; 	       (set-insert x y-equiv)))
;;
;; Extending context congruence might involve an obligation along
;; the lines of:
;;
;; (implies
;;   (and
;;     (rationalp n)
;;     (not (equal n 0))
;;     (equiv1 x (mod a n))
;;     (equiv1 y (mod b n)))
;;   (equiv2 (mod (+ a b) n)
;;           (mod (+ x y) n)))
;;
;; Much like a congruence rule, this rule is not used as a rewrite
;; rule per-se. Rather, it reprograms the behavior of the rewriter,
;; letting it know the conditions under which it can rewrite certain
;; terms under a new context.
;;
;; If this were a simple rewrite rule, it would perform the following
;; transformation:
;;
;; (mod (+ x y) n) => (mod (+ (mod x n) (mod y n)) n)
;;
;; However, because because (mod _ n) is a known context, the rewriter 
;; merely activates a (mod _ n) context when rewriting each term.  Thus,
;; plausable appliations of this rule might include:
;;
;; (mod (+ x y) n) => (mod (+ x y) n)
;;
;; (mod (+ (mod x n) y) n) => (mod (+ x y) n)
;;
;; (mod (+ n x y) n) => (mod (+ x y) n)
;;
;; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
;; 
;; The mechanics of contextual rewriting might be very similar to the
;; way our poor man's rules work below.  In the theory below, we
;; present ACL2 with a "congruence" theorem of the form:
;;
;; (implies
;;   (and
;;     ( .. check for recursion .. )
;;     (rationalp a)
;;     (rationalp n)
;;     (not (equal n 0))
;;     ( .. syntactic check for when a = (mod v n) ..)
;;     (equal z (mod a n))
;;     (equal x ( .. syntactic manipulation when z = (mod w n) ..))
;;     ( validity checks )
;;     ( .. syntax check for a != x ..)
;;     )
;;   (equal (foo a n)
;;          (foo x n))
;;
;; The first hypothesis is supposed to check to make sure we don't
;; call this function recursively on the rewritten RHS of this
;; function.  This currently works only under :brr t
;;
;; The first syntactic check for a = (mod v n) tells us that, if
;; a = (mod v n), we probably won't be able to reduce it mod n
;; anyway.
;;
;; If a != (mov v n), we create a term of the form (mod a n) and
;; bind it to z.  This causes the rewriter to simplify a mod n
;; and binds the simplified term to z.
;;
;; The next syntactic manipulation takes terms of the form (mod w n)
;; and extracts the "w" portion, binding it to x.  If the term is not
;; of this form, x is bound to z.  By "unwrapping" the resulting term,
;; we keep from "littering" unsimplified terms with (mod _ n)
;; expressions.
;;
;; Because we are unwrapping terms syntactically, we need logical
;; tests to guarantee that we have not "broken" anything.
;;
;; The final syntactic check tells us whether we have actually 
;; done anything.  If term a has actually changed in the course
;; of this process, we rewrite (foo a n) into (foo x n).
;;
;; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
;;
;; How might ACL2 rewrite in a given "context"?  Imagine that we are
;; rewriting term0 in a context like (mod _ n) under the equivalence
;; relation equiv.
;;
;; 1. Rewrite term0 using the weakest equivalence available for
;;    the 1st position of mod to produce term1
;;
;; 2. Create a new term2 = `(mod ,term1 n)
;;
;; 3. rewrite term2 under equiv to produce term3
;;
;; 4. If term3 is different from term2, set term0 = term3 and goto 1.
;;
;; 5. If term3 == term2, then return term1
;;
;; (Note that the "context" function must be idempotent in its "free"
;;  position in order for this to work)
;;
;; What would cause ACL2 to enter a new context?
;;
;; - Encountering a term whose leading function symbol is a known
;;   context.  We then rewrite the "free" argument of that term
;;   in the context suggested by the function.
;;
;; - Encountering a term that triggers a "context congruence" rule.
;;   We may then rewrite selected arguments in the contexts suggested
;;   by the "context congruence" rule.
;; 
;; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
;; 
;; Note that congruence based rewriting can often (always?) be
;; emulated with context rewriting if we define an appropriate
;; "fix" function and use that as a context.
;;
;; (defcontext (fix-set x) 1)
;;
;; (implies
;;   (equal x (fix-set a))
;;   (equal (fix-set (set-insert v a))
;;          (fix-set (set-insert v x))))
;;
;; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
;;
;; While (mod _ n) is one of the more obvious contexts in which this
;; technique would be useful, there would also be a significant
;; advantage to employing rewriting contexts in standard interpreter
;; analysis.
;; 
;; Imagine a function (cp list st1 st2) that copies a list of address
;; locations from st1 to st2.  (cp list _ nil) could be defined as a
;; "context" and used to "fix" the memory such that only those values
;; used by a particular function would be retained.  Thus we would
;; have:
;;
;; (implies
;;   (equal st2 (cp (foo-use-set) st1 nil))
;;   (equal (foo st1)
;;          (foo st2)))
;;
;;
;; And terms like:
;;
;;   (foo (s a v r)) 
;;
;; would rewrite "automagically" to 
;;
;;   (foo r) 
;;
;; if "a" was not in the "use set" of foo.
;;

;; current notion of refinement?  How might that work?
;;
;; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
;;
;; Potential actions:
;;
;; 1. Forget generalized contexts.  Just fix the rewrite cache to
;;    re-simplify under weaker equivalences and call it good.
;;
;; 2. The poor man approch is good enough.  Provide support so that
;;    "non-recursive" works correctly under :brr nil and, possibly,
;;    provide (equiv x (term)) the same behavior as (equal x (term))
;;    when x is free in the hypothesis of a theorem.
;;
;; 3. Extend the rewriter to support more generalized contexts and/or
;;    to provide an efficient implementation of the basic functionality
;;    demonstrated below.
;;
;; 4. Go all the way and actually extend the current binary equivalence
;;    relations to include n-ary equivalence relations.

;; 
;; The defequiv+ macro extends the notion of equivalance relations to
;; include arbitrary boolean relations.  In particular, we want to be
;; able to rewrite a term while preserving the truth of some boolean
;; relation.  Usually, this involves making the term "more true" such
;; as by rewriting the set {a,b} into {a,b,c} preserving (subset x {a
;; b}).  The macro accepts a predicate term expression and a number of
;; keywords as below:
;;
;; (defequiv+ 
;;  (< n x)
;;  :rhs     n
;;  :pred    <-pred 
;;  :context <-ctx
;;  :equiv   <-equiv
;;  )
;;
;; The :rhs term identifies which variable in the predicate expression
;; will be construed as the rewritten term.  If left blank, we assume
;; a binary relation and we use the second argument.
;; 
;; The name of the "equivlance relation" constructed by the macro can
;; be specified by the user via the :equiv keyword.  By default it is
;; computed from the leading function symbol of the provided term by
;; concatenating it with "_EQUIV".  Note, however, that the generated
;; "equivalence relation" is merely a macro that expands into an
;; equality between two predicates.  Thus, the equivalance relation
;; should only be used to define rewrite rules and not be used to
;; express hypotheses.
;; 
;; Rules expressed in terms of the generated equivalence relation will
;; key off of (will rewrite) :context expressions.  The user can
;; supply the name of the :context via the macro keyword, or it will
;; be computed from the leading function symbol of the provided term
;; by concatenating it with "_CTX".  When using defequiv+ terms in
;; conjunction with defcong+, we express the congruences as:
;;
;; :cong ((z (<-ctx v)))
;;
;; Which is to say, we place the terms we want to rewrite in the
;; :context in which we want them rewritten.
;;
;; The :pred keyword can be used to specify the name of a function
;; defined to be exactly the term supplied to the macro.  This
;; function helps to differentiate "rewrite" rules associated with the
;; relation from predicate rules that hang on the relation itself.
;; Such rules can otherwise cause the "equivlalence" rewriting to
;; result in "TRUE" which turns out to be not particularly useful for
;; our purposes.
