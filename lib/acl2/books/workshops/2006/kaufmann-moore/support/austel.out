 Note: We have modified the prompt in some underlying Lisps to further
 distinguish it from the ACL2 prompt.

 NOTE!!  Proof trees are disabled in ACL2.  To enable them in emacs,
 look under the ACL2 source directory in interface/emacs/README.doc; 
 and, to turn on proof trees, execute :START-PROOF-TREE in the ACL2 
 command loop.   Look in the ACL2 documentation under PROOF-TREE.

ACL2 Warning [Non-rec] in ( DEFTHM BOOLEANP-PROP ...):  A :REWRITE
rule generated from BOOLEANP-PROP will be triggered only by terms containing
the non-recursive function symbol PROP.  Unless this function is disabled,
this rule is unlikely ever to be used.

BOOLEANP-PROP

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM EQV-FN-PROP ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from EQV-FN-PROP, equivalence relation EQV is maintained
at one problematic occurrence of variable X in the right-hand side,
but not at any binding occurrence of X.  Consider replacing that occurrence
of X in the right-hand side with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X).  See :doc double-
rewrite for more information on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Non-rec] in ( DEFTHM EQV-FN-PROP ...):  A :REWRITE rule
generated from EQV-FN-PROP will be triggered only by terms containing
the non-recursive function symbol FN1.  Unless this function is disabled,
this rule is unlikely ever to be used.


ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM EQV-FN-PROP ...):  The previously
added rule FN1 subsumes a newly proposed :REWRITE rule generated from
EQV-FN-PROP, in the sense that the old rule rewrites a more general
target.  Because the new rule will be tried first, it may nonetheless
find application.

EQV-FN-PROP

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM PROP-THM ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from PROP-THM, equivalence relation EQV is maintained
at one problematic occurrence of variable Y in the first hypothesis,
but not at any binding occurrence of Y.  Consider replacing that occurrence
of Y in the first hypothesis with (DOUBLE-REWRITE Y).  See :doc double-
rewrite for more information on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Non-rec] in ( DEFTHM PROP-THM ...):  A :REWRITE rule
generated from PROP-THM will be triggered only by terms containing
the non-recursive function symbol PROP.  Unless this function is disabled,
this rule is unlikely ever to be used.


ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM PROP-THM ...):  The previously added
rule PROP subsumes a newly proposed :REWRITE rule generated from PROP-
THM, in the sense that the old rule rewrites a more general target.
Because the new rule will be tried first, it may nonetheless find application.

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM PROP-THM-BAD ...):  In a
:REWRITE rule generated from PROP-THM-BAD, equivalence relation EQV is
maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable X in the first
hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of X.  Consider replacing
that occurrence of X in the first hypothesis with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X).
See :doc double-rewrite for more information on this issue.

"/Users/huangjianshi/src/acl2-sources/books/workshops/2006/kaufmann-moore/support/austel.lisp"
defines the function EQV, which has not had its guards verified.  See
:DOC guards.
