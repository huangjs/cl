 See the documentation topic note-3-1 for recent changes.
 Note: We have modified the prompt in some underlying Lisps to further
 distinguish it from the ACL2 prompt.

 NOTE!!  Proof trees are disabled in ACL2.  To enable them in emacs,
 look under the ACL2 source directory in interface/emacs/README.doc; 
 and, to turn on proof trees, execute :START-PROOF-TREE in the ACL2 
 command loop.   Look in the ACL2 documentation under PROOF-TREE.

ACL2 !>
ACL2 Warning [Skip-proofs] in CERTIFY-BOOK:  ACL2 has encountered a
SKIP-PROOFS form, 
(SKIP-PROOFS (PROGN (DEFSTUB C (X) T)
                    (DEFSTUB E (X) T)
                    (DEFSTUB F (X) T)
                    (DEFSTUB G (X) T)
                    (DEFSTUB H (X) T)
                    (DEFSTUB I (X) T)
                    ...)),
in the context of a book or an encapsulate event.  Therefore, no logical
claims may be soundly made in this context.  See :DOC SKIP-PROOFS.


ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM RULE1 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from RULE1, equivalence relation IFF is maintained at
one problematic occurrence of variable X in the right-hand side, but
not at any binding occurrence of X.  Consider replacing that occurrence
of X in the right-hand side with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X).  See :doc double-
rewrite for more information on this issue.

ACL2 Warning [Skip-proofs] in (CERTIFY-BOOK "rhs1-iff" ...):  The book
"/Users/huangjianshi/src/acl2-sources/books/workshops/2006/kaufmann-moore/support/rhs1-iff.lisp"
contains one or more SKIP-PROOFS events.
