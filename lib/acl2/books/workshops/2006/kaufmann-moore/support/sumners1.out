 Note: We have modified the prompt in some underlying Lisps to further
 distinguish it from the ACL2 prompt.

 NOTE!!  Proof trees are disabled in ACL2.  To enable them in emacs,
 look under the ACL2 source directory in interface/emacs/README.doc; 
 and, to turn on proof trees, execute :START-PROOF-TREE in the ACL2 
 command loop.   Look in the ACL2 documentation under PROOF-TREE.

ACL2 !>F

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM F-X-IFF-X ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from F-X-IFF-X, equivalence relation IFF is maintained
at one problematic occurrence of variable X in the right-hand side,
but not at any binding occurrence of X.  Consider replacing that occurrence
of X in the right-hand side with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X).  See :doc double-
rewrite for more information on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Non-rec] in ( DEFTHM F-X-IFF-X ...):  A :REWRITE rule
generated from F-X-IFF-X will be triggered only by terms containing
the non-recursive function symbol F.  Unless this function is disabled,
this rule is unlikely ever to be used.

G

ACL2 Warning [Non-rec] in ( DEFTHM G-X-IF-X ...):  A :REWRITE rule
generated from G-X-IF-X will be triggered only by terms containing
the non-recursive function symbol G.  Unless this function is disabled,
this rule is unlikely ever to be used.


ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM G-X-IF-X ...):  The previously added
rule G subsumes a newly proposed :REWRITE rule generated from G-X-IF-
X, in the sense that the old rule rewrites a more general target. 
Because the new rule will be tried first, it may nonetheless find application.

ACL2 Warning [Guards] in (CERTIFY-BOOK "sumners1" ...):  The book 
"/Users/huangjianshi/src/acl2-sources/books/workshops/2006/kaufmann-moore/support/sumners1.lisp"
defines the functions F and G, which have not had their guards verified.
See :DOC guards.
