ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM TEST1 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from TEST1, equivalence relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV2
are maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable Y1 in the
first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of Y1.  Consider
replacing that occurrence of Y1 in the first hypothesis with 
(DOUBLE-REWRITE Y1).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information
on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM TEST1 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from TEST1, equivalence relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV2
are maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable Y2 in the
second hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of Y2.  Consider
replacing that occurrence of Y2 in the second hypothesis with 
(DOUBLE-REWRITE Y2).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information
on this issue.

TEST1

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM TEST2 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from TEST2, equivalence relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV1
are maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable X1 in the
first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of X1.  Consider
replacing that occurrence of X1 in the first hypothesis with 
(DOUBLE-REWRITE X1).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information

TEST2

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM TEST3 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from TEST3, equivalence relations EQUIV2, EQUIV3 and
EQUIV1 are maintained at two problematic occurrences of variable X1
in the first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of X1. 
Consider replacing those two occurrences of X1 in the first hypothesis
with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X1).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM TEST3-HALF-FIXED ...):
In a :REWRITE rule generated from TEST3-HALF-FIXED, equivalence relations
EQUIV3 and EQUIV2 are maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable
X1 in the first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of X1.

TEST3-HALF-FIXED

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM LIN-TEST1 ...):  In a :LINEAR
rule generated from LIN-TEST1 for trigger term (FOO X1 Y1), equivalence
relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV1 are maintained at one problematic occurrence
of variable X1 in the first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence
of X1.  Consider replacing that occurrence of X1 in the first hypothesis
with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X1).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information
on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM LIN-TEST1 ...):  In a :LINEAR
rule generated from LIN-TEST1 for trigger term (FOO X1 Y1), equivalence
relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV2 are maintained at one problematic occurrence
of variable Y1 in the first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence
of Y1.  Consider replacing that occurrence of Y1 in the first hypothesis

LIN-TEST1

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM LIN-TEST2 ...):  In a :LINEAR
rule generated from LIN-TEST2 for trigger term (FOO X1 Y1), equivalence
relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV1 are maintained at one problematic occurrence
of variable X1 in the first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence
of X1.  Consider replacing that occurrence of X1 in the first hypothesis
with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X1).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information
on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Free] in ( DEFAXIOM LIN-TEST2 ...):  A :LINEAR rule generated
from LIN-TEST2 will be triggered by the term (FOO X1 Y1).  When LIN-
TEST2 is triggered by (FOO X1 Y1) the variable Z1 will be chosen by
searching for an instance of (PRED X1 Z1) among the hypotheses of the
conjecture being rewritten.  This is generally a severe restriction
on the applicability of the :LINEAR rule.

LIN-TEST2

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM LIN-TEST3 ...):  In a :LINEAR
rule generated from LIN-TEST3 for trigger term (FOO Y1 X1), equivalence
relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV1 are maintained at one problematic occurrence
of variable X1 in the first hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence
of X1.  Consider replacing that occurrence of X1 in the first hypothesis
with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X1).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information
on this issue.

LIN-TEST3

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM RHS1 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from RHS1, equivalence relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV2 are
maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable Y1 in the right-
hand side, but not at any binding occurrence of Y1.  Consider replacing
that occurrence of Y1 in the right-hand side with (DOUBLE-REWRITE Y1).
See :doc double-rewrite for more information on this issue.


ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFAXIOM RHS1 ...):  A newly proposed :REWRITE
rule generated from RHS1 probably subsumes the previously added :REWRITE
rule TEST1, in the sense that the new rule will now probably be applied
whenever the old rule would have been.

RHS1

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM RHS2 ...):  In a :REWRITE
rule generated from RHS2, equivalence relations EQUIV3 and EQUIV2 are
maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable Y1 in the first
hypothesis, but not at any binding occurrence of Y1.  Consider replacing
that occurrence of Y1 in the first hypothesis with (DOUBLE-REWRITE Y1).

ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFAXIOM RHS2 ...):  The previously added
rule RHS1 subsumes a newly proposed :REWRITE rule generated from RHS2,
in the sense that the old rule rewrites a more general target.  Because
the new rule will be tried first, it may nonetheless find application.

RHS2

ACL2 Warning [Skip-proofs] in CERTIFY-BOOK:  ACL2 has encountered a
SKIP-PROOFS form, (SKIP-PROOFS (DEFCONG EQUIV1 EQUAL (FOO X Y) 1)),
in the context of a book or an encapsulate event.  Therefore, no logical
claims may be soundly made in this context.  See :DOC SKIP-PROOFS.

ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFAXIOM RHS-LIN ...):  In a :LINEAR
rule generated from RHS-LIN for trigger term (FOO Y1 X1), equivalence
relation EQUIV1 is maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable
X1 in the conclusion, but not at any binding occurrence of X1.  Consider
replacing that occurrence of X1 in the conclusion with (DOUBLE-REWRITE X1).
