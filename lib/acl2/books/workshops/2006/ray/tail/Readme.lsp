(:ABSTRACT 
"
We investigate logical issues in axiomatizing functions in ACL2 with equations
that involve both recursive calls and quantifiers. We identify a class of such
equations, called {\em extended tail-recursive equations}, that can be
uniformly introduced in the logic.  We point out practical benefits of this
axiomatization, and discuss logical impediments behind the introduction of more
general quantified formulas.
