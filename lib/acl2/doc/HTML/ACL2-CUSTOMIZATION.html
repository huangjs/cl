<h2>ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION</h2>file of initial commands for ACL2 to run at <a href="STARTUP.html">startup</a>
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

The file <code>"acl2-customization.lisp"</code> is automatically loaded, via
<code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>, the first time <code><a href="LP.html">lp</a></code> is called in an ACL2 session, provided
such a file exists on the current directory.  Except for the fact
that this <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> command is not typed explicitly by you, it is a
standard <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> command, with one exception:  any settings of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>
specials are remembered once this call of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> has completed.  For
example, suppose that you start your customization file with
<code>(set-ld-skip-proofsp t state)</code>, so that proofs are skipped as it is
loaded with <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>.  Then the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> special <code><a href="LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></code> will remain <code>t</code>
after the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> has completed, causing proofs to be skipped in your
ACL2 session, unless your customization file sets this variable back
to <code>nil</code>, say with <code>(set-ld-skip-proofsp nil state)</code>.
<p>
The customization file <code>"acl2-customization.lisp"</code> actually
resides on the connected book directory; see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>.  Except, if
that file does not exist, then ACL2 looks for
<code>"acl2-customization.lisp"</code> on your home directory.  If ACL2 does
not find that file either, then no customization occurs and <code><a href="LP.html">lp</a></code>
enters the standard ACL2 read-eval-print loop.<p>

If the customization file exists, it is loaded with <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> using the
usual default values for the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> specials (see <a href="LD.html">ld</a>).  Thus, if an
error is encountered, no subsequent forms in the file will be
evaluated.<p>

To create a customization file it is recommended that you first give
it a name other than <code>"acl2-customization.lisp"</code> so that ACL2 does
not try to include it prematurely when you next enter <code><a href="LP.html">lp</a></code>.  Then,
while in the uncustomized <code><a href="LP.html">lp</a></code>, explicitly invoke <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> on your evolving
(but renamed) customization file until all forms are successfully
evaluated.  The same procedure is recommended if for some reason
ACL2 cannot successfully evaluate all forms in your customization
file:  rename your customization file so that ACL2 does not try to
<code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> it automatically and then debug the new file by explicit calls to
<code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>.<p>

When you have created a file that can be loaded with <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> without
error and that you wish to be your customization file, name it
<code>"acl2-customization.lisp"</code> and put it on the current directory or
in your home directory.  The first time after starting up ACL2 that
you invoke <code>(lp)</code>, ACL2 will automatically load the
<code>"acl2-customization.lisp"</code> file from the cbd (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>) if
there is one, and otherwise will load it from your home directory.<p>

Note that if you certify a book after the (automatic) loading of an
<code>acl2-customization</code> file, the forms in that file <strong>will be part of the</strong>
<strong>portcullis</strong> of the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> you certify!  That is, the forms in your
customization file at certification time will be loaded whenever
anybody uses the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> you are certifying.  Since customization
files generally contain idiosyncratic <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s, you may not want
yours to be part of the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> you create for others.  Thus, if you
have a customization file then you may want to invoke <code>:ubt 1</code> before
certifying any <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.<p>

The conventions concerning ACL2 customization are liable to change
as we get more experience with the interaction between
customization, certification of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> for others, and routine
undoing.  For example, at the moment it is regarded as a <strong>feature</strong> of
customization that it can be undone but it might be regarded as a
bug if you accidentally undo your customization.
