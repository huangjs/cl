<h3>ACL2-PC::ADD-ABBREVIATION</h3>(primitive)
<code>   </code>add an abbreviation
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>

Example:  <code>(add-abbreviation v (* x y))</code> causes future occurrences of
<code>(* x y)</code> to be printed as <code>(? v)</code>, until (unless) a corresponding
invocation of <code>remove-abbreviations</code> occurs.  In this case we say that
<code>v</code> ``abbreviates'' <code>(* x y)</code>.
<p>

<pre>
General Form:
(add-abbreviation var &amp;optional raw-term)
</pre>

Let <code>var</code> be an abbreviation for <code>raw-term</code>, if <code>raw-term</code> is supplied,
else for the current subterm.  Note that <code>var</code> must be a variable that
does not already abbreviate some term.<p>

A way to think of abbreviations is as follows.  Imagine that
whenever an abbreviation is added, say <code>v</code> abbreviates <code>expr</code>, an entry
associating <code>v</code> to <code>expr</code> is made in an association list, which we will
call ``<code>*abbreviations-alist*</code>''.  Then simply imagine that <code>?</code> is a
function defined by something like:

<pre>
(defun ? (v)
  (let ((pair (assoc v *abbreviations-alist*)))
    (if pair (cdr pair)
      (error ...))))
</pre>

Of course the implementation isn't exactly like that, since the
``constant'' <code>*abbreviations-alist*</code> actually changes each time an
<code>add-abbreviation</code> instruction is successfully invoked.  Nevertheless,
if one imagines an appropriate redefinition of the ``constant''
<code>*abbreviations-alist*</code> each time an <code>add-abbreviation</code> is invoked, then
one will have a clear model of the meaning of such an instruction.<p>

The effect of abbreviations on output is that before printing a
term, each subterm that is abbreviated by a variable <code>v</code> is first
replaced by <code>(? v)</code>.<p>

The effect of abbreviations on input is that every built-in
proof-checker command accepts abbreviations wherever a term is
expected as an argument, i.e., accepts the syntax <code>(? v)</code> whenever <code>v</code>
abbreviates a term.  For example, the second argument of
<code>add-abbreviation</code> may itself use abbreviations that have been defined
by previous <code>add-abbreviation</code> instructions.<p>
