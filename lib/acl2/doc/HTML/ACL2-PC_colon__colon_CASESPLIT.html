<h3>ACL2-PC::CASESPLIT</h3>(primitive)
<code>   </code>split into two cases

<pre>
Example:
(casesplit (&lt; x y)) -- assuming that we are at the top of the
                       conclusion, add (&lt; x y) as a new top-level
                       hypothesis in the current goal, and create a
                       subgoal identical to the current goal except
                       that it has (not (&lt; x y)) as a new top-level
                       hypothesis
<p>
General Form:
(casesplit expr &amp;optional use-hyps-flag do-not-flatten-flag)
</pre>

When the current subterm is the entire conclusion, this instruction
adds <code>expr</code> as a new top-level hypothesis, and create a subgoal
identical to the existing current goal except that it has the
negation of <code>expr</code> as a new top-level hypothesis.  See also <code>claim</code>.
The optional arguments control the use of governors and the
``flattening'' of new hypotheses, as we now explain.<p>

The argument <code>use-hyps-flag</code> is only of interest when there are
governors.  (To read about governors, see the documentation for the
command <code>hyps</code>).  In that case, if <code>use-hyps-flag</code> is not supplied or is
<code>nil</code>, then the description above is correct; but otherwise, it is not
<code>expr</code> but rather it is <code>(implies govs expr)</code> that is added as a new
top-level hypothesis (and whose negation is added as a top-level
hypothesis for the new goal), where <code>govs</code> is the conjunction of the
governors.<p>

If <code>do-not-flatten-flag</code> is supplied and not <code>nil</code>, then that is
all there is to this command.  Otherwise (thus this is the default),
when the claimed term (first argument) is a conjunction (<code>and</code>) of
terms and the <code>claim</code> instruction succeeds, then each (nested)
conjunct of the claimed term is added as a separate new top-level
hypothesis.  Consider the following example, assuming there are no
governors.

<pre>
(casesplit (and (and (&lt; x y) (integerp a)) (equal r s)) t)
</pre>

Three new top-level hypotheses are added to the current goal, namely
<code>(&lt; x y)</code>, <code>(integerp a)</code>, and <code>(equal r s)</code>.  In that case, only
one hypothesis is added to create the new goal, namely the negation
of <code>(and (&lt; x y) (integerp a) (equal r s))</code>.  If the negation of this
term had been <code>claim</code>ed, then it would be the other way around:  the
current goal would get a single new hypothesis while the new goal
would be created by adding three hypotheses.<p>
