<h3>ACL2-PC::CLAIM</h3>(atomic macro)
<code>   </code>add a new hypothesis
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
(claim (&lt; x y))   -- attempt to prove (&lt; x y) from the current
                     top-level hypotheses and if successful, then
                     add (&lt; x y) as a new top-level hypothesis in
                     the current goal
(claim (&lt; x y)
       :otf-flg t
       :hints (("Goal" :induct t)))
                  -- as above, but call the prover using the
                     indicated values for the otf-flg and hints
(claim (&lt; x y) 0) -- as above, except instead of attempting to
                     prove (&lt; x y), create a new subgoal with the
                     same top-level hypotheses as the current goal
                     that has (&lt; x y) as its conclusion
(claim (&lt; x y) :hints :none)
                  -- same as immediately above
<p>
General Form:
(claim expr &amp;rest rest-args)
</pre>

This command creates a new subgoal with the same top-level
hypotheses as the current goal but with a conclusion of <code>expr</code>.  If
<code>rest-args</code> is a non-empty list headed by a non-keyword, then there
will be no proof attempted for the new subgoal.  With that possible
exception, <code>rest-args</code> should consist of keyword arguments.  The
keyword argument <code>:do-not-flatten</code> controls the ``flattening'' of new
hypotheses, just as with the <code>casesplit</code> command (as described in its
documentation).  The remaining <code>rest-args</code> are used with a call the
<code>prove</code> command on the new subgoal, except that if <code>:hints</code> is a non-<code>nil</code>
atom, then the prover is not called -- rather, this is the same as
the situation described above, where <code>rest-args</code> is a non-empty list
headed by a non-keyword.<p>

<strong>Notes:</strong>  (1) Unlike the <code>casesplit</code> command, the <code>claim</code>
command is completely insensitive to governors. (2) It is allowed to
use abbreviations in the hints.  (3) The keyword :<code>none</code> has the
special role as a value of :<code>hints</code> that is shown clearly in an
example above.
