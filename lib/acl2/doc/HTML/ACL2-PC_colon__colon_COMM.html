<code>   </code>display instructions from the current interactive session
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
comm
(comm 10)
<p>
General Form:
(comm &amp;optional n)
</pre>

Prints out instructions in reverse order.  This is actually the same
as <code>(commands n t)</code> -- or, <code>(commands nil t)</code> if <code>n</code> is not supplied.  As
explained in the documentation for <code>commands</code>, the final argument of <code>t</code>
causes suppression of instructions occurring between so-called
``matching bookends,'' which we now explain.<p>

A ``begin bookend'' is an instruction of the form

<pre>
(COMMENT :BEGIN x . y).
</pre>

Similarly, an ``end bookend'' is an instruction of the form

<pre>
(COMMENT :END x' . y').
</pre>

The ``name'' of the first bookend is <code>x</code> and the ``name'' of the
second bookend is <code>x'</code>.  When such a pair of instructions occurs in
the current state-stack, we call them ``matching bookends'' provided
that they have the same name (i.e. <code>x</code> equals <code>x'</code>) and if no other
begin or end bookend with name <code>x</code> occurs between them.  The idea now
is that <code>comm</code> hides matching bookends together with the instructions
they enclose.  Here is a more precise explanation of this
``hiding''; probably there is no value in reading on!<p>

A <code>comm</code> instruction hides bookends in the following manner.  (So does
a <code>comment</code> instruction when its second optional argument is supplied
and non-<code>nil</code>.)  First, if the first argument <code>n</code> is supplied and not
<code>nil</code>, then we consider only the last <code>n</code> instructions from the
state-stack; otherwise, we consider them all.  Now the resulting
list of instructions is replaced by the result of applying the
following process to each pair of matching bookends:  the pair is
removed, together with everything in between the begin and end
bookend of the pair, and all this is replaced by the ``instruction''

<pre>
("***HIDING***" :COMMENT :BEGIN name ...)
</pre>

where <code>(comment begin name ...)</code> is the begin bookend of the pair.
Finally, after applying this process to each pair of matching
bookends, each begin bookend of the form <code>(comment begin name ...)</code>
that remains is replaced by

<pre>
("***UNFINISHED***" :COMMENT :BEGIN name ...) .
