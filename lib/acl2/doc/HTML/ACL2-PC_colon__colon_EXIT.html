<code>   </code>exit the interactive proof-checker
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
exit                        -- exit the interactive proof-checker
(exit append-associativity) -- exit and create a defthm
                               event named append-associativity
<p>
General Forms:<p>

exit --  Exit without storing an event.<p>

(exit event-name &amp;optional rule-classes do-it-flg)
Exit, and store an event.
</pre>

The command <code>exit</code> returns you to the ACL2 loop.  At a later time,
<code>(verify)</code> may be executed to get back into the same proof-checker
state, as long as there hasn't been an intervening use of the
proof-checker (otherwise see <code>save</code>).<p>

When given one or more arguments as shown above, <code>exit</code> still returns
you to the ACL2 loop, but first, if the interactive proof is
complete, then it attempts create a <code>defthm</code> event with the specified
<code>event-name</code> and <code>rule-classes</code> (which defaults to <code>(:rewrite)</code> if not
supplied).  The event will be printed to the terminal, and then
normally the user will be queried whether an event should really be
created.  However, if the final optional argument <code>do-it-flg</code> is
supplied and not <code>nil</code>, then an event will be made without a query.<p>

For example, the form

<pre>
(exit top-pop-elim (:elim :rewrite) t)
</pre>

causes a <code>defthm</code> event named <code>top-pop-elim</code> to be created with
rule-classes <code>(:elim :rewrite)</code>, without a query to the user (because
of the argument <code>t</code>).<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  it is permitted for <code>event-name</code> to be <code>nil</code>.  In that case, the
name of the event will be the name supplied during the original call
of <code>verify</code>.  (See the documentation for <code>verify</code> and <code>commands</code>.)  Also
in that case, if <code>rule-classes</code> is not supplied then it defaults to
the rule-classes supplied in the original call of <code>verify</code>.<p>

<code>Comments</code> on ``success'' and ``failure''.  An <code>exit</code> instruction will
always ``fail'', so for example, if it appears as an argument of a
<code>do-strict</code> instruction then none of the later (instruction) arguments
will be executed.  Moreover, the ``failure'' will be ``hard'' if an
event is successfully created or if the instruction is simply <code>exit</code>;
otherwise it will be ``soft''.  See the documentation for <code>sequence</code>
for an explanation of hard and soft ``failures''.  An obscure but
potentially important fact is that if the ``failure'' is hard, then
the error signal is a special signal that the top-level interactive
loop can interpret as a request to exit.  Thus for example, a
sequencing command that turns an error triple <code>(mv erp val state)</code>
into <code>(mv t val state)</code> would never cause an exit from the interactive
loop.<p>

If the proof is not complete, then <code>(exit event-name ...)</code> will not
cause an exit from the interactive loop.  However, in that case it
will print out the original user-supplied goal (the one that was
supplied with the call to <code>verify</code>) and the current list of
instructions.
