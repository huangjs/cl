<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
(forwardchain 2) ; Second hypothesis should be of the form
                 ; (IMPLIES hyp concl), and the result is to replace
                 ; that hypothesis with concl.

<p>
General Forms:
(forwardchain hypothesis-number)
(forwardchain hypothesis-number hints)
(forwardchain hypothesis-number hints quiet-flg)
</pre>
<p>

This command replaces the hypothesis corresponding to given index,
which should be of the form <code>(IMPLIES hyp concl)</code>, with its
consequent <code>concl</code>.  In fact, the given hypothesis is dropped, and
the replacement hypothesis will appear as the final hypothesis after
this command is executed.<p>

The prover must be able to prove the indicated hypothesis from the
other hypotheses, or else the command will fail.  The <code>:hints</code>
argument is used in this prover call, and should have the usual
syntax of hints to the prover.<p>

Output is suppressed if <code>quiet-flg</code> is supplied and not <code>nil</code>.
