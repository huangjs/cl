<pre>
Example:
(generalize 
 ((and (true-listp x) (true-listp y)) 0)
 ((append x y) w))
<p>
General Form:
(generalize &amp;rest substitution)
</pre>

Generalize using the indicated substitution, which should be a
non-empty list.  Each element of that list should be a two-element
list of the form <code>(term variable)</code>, where <code>term</code> may use abbreviations.
The effect of the instruction is to replace each such term in the
current goal by the corresponding variable.  This replacement is
carried out by a parallel substitution, outside-in in each
hypothesis and in the conclusion.  More generally, actually, the
``variable'' (second) component of each pair may be <code>nil</code> or a number,
which causes the system to generate a new name of the form <code>_</code> or <code>_n</code>,
with <code>n</code> a natural number; more on this below.  However, when a
variable is supplied, it must not occur in any goal of the current
proof-checker state.<p>

When the ``variable'' above is <code>nil</code>, the system will treat it as the
variable <code>|_|</code> if that variable does not occur in any goal of the
current proof-checker state.  Otherwise it treats it as <code>|_0|</code>, or
<code>|_1|</code>, or <code>|_2|</code>, and so on, until one of these is not among the
variables of the current proof-checker state.  If the ``variable''
is a non-negative integer <code>n</code>, then the system treats it as <code>|_n|</code>
unless that variable already occurs among the current goals, in
which case it increments n just as above until it obtains a new
variable.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  The same variable may not occur as the variable component of
two different arguments (though <code>nil</code> may occur arbitrarily many
times, as may a positive integer).
