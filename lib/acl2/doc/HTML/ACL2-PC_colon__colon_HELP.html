<h3>ACL2-PC::HELP</h3>(macro)
<code>   </code>proof-checker help facility
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:<p>

(help rewrite) -- partial documentation on the rewrite command; the
                  rest is available using more or more!<p>

(help! rewrite) -- full documentation on the rewrite command<p>

help, help!     -- this documentation (in part, or in totality,
                   respectively)
<p>
General Forms:
(help &amp;optional command)
(help! &amp;optional command)
more
more!
</pre>

The proof checker supports the same kind of documentation as does
ACL2 proper.  The main difference is that you need to type

<pre>
(help command)
</pre>

in a list rather than <code>:doc command</code>.  So, to get all the
documentation on <code>command</code>, type <code>(help! command)</code> inside the
interactive loop, but to get only a one-line description of the
command together with some examples, type <code>(help command)</code>.  In the
latter case, you can get the rest of the help by typing <code>more!</code>; or
type <code>more</code> if you don't necessarily want all the rest of the help at
once.  (Then keep typing <code>more</code> if you want to keep getting more of
the help for that command.)<p>

To summarize:  as with ACL2, you can type either of the following:

<pre>
more, more!
-- to obtain more (or, all the rest of) the documentation last
   requested by help (or, outside the proof-checker's loop, :doc)
</pre>

It has been arranged that the use of <code>(help command)</code> will tell you
just about everything you could want to know about <code>command</code>, almost
always by way of examples.  For more details about a command, use
<code>help!</code>, <code>more</code>, or <code>more!</code>.<p>

We use the word ``command'' to refer to the name itself, e.g.
<code>rewrite</code>.  We use the word ``instruction'' to refer to an input to
the interactive system, e.g. <code>(rewrite foo)</code> or <code>(help split)</code>.  Of
course, we allow commands with no arguments as instructions in many
cases, e.g. <code>rewrite</code>.  In such cases, <code>command</code> is treated identically
to <code>(command)</code>.
