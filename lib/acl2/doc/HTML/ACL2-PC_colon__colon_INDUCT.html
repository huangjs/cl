<h3>ACL2-PC::INDUCT</h3>(atomic macro)
<code>   </code>generate subgoals using induction
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
induct, (induct t)
   -- induct according to a heuristically-chosen scheme, creating
      a new subgoal for each base and induction step
(induct (append (reverse x) y))
   -- as above, but choose an induction scheme based on the term
      (append (reverse x) y) rather than on the current goal
<p>
General Form:
(induct &amp;optional term)
</pre>

Induct as in the corresponding <code>:induct</code> hint given to the theorem
prover, creating new subgoals for the base and induction steps.  If
term is <code>t</code> or is not supplied, then use the current goal to determine
the induction scheme; otherwise, use that term.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  As usual, abbreviations are allowed in the term.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  <code>Induct</code> actually calls the <code>prove</code> command with all processes
turned off.  Thus, you must be at top of the goal for an <code>induct</code>
instruction.
