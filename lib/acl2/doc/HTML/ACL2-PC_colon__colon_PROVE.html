<h3>ACL2-PC::PROVE</h3>(primitive)
<code>   </code>call the ACL2 theorem prover to prove the current goal
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
prove -- attempt to prove the current goal
(prove :otf-flg t
       :hints (("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar)))
      -- attempt to prove the current goal, with the indicated hints
         and with OTF-FLG set
<p>
General Form:
(prove &amp;rest rest-args)
</pre>

Attempt to prove the current goal, where <code>rest-args</code> is as in the
keyword arguments to <code>defthm</code> except that only <code>:hints</code> and <code>:otf-flg</code> are
allowed.  The command succeeds exactly when the corresponding <code>defthm</code>
would succeed, except that it is all right for some goals to be
given ``bye''s.  Each goal given a ``bye'' will be turned into a new
subgoal.  (See <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> for an explanation of <code>:by</code> hints.)<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  Use <code>(= t)</code> instead if you are not at the top of the
conclusion.  Also note that if there are any hypotheses in the
current goal, then what is actually attempted is a proof of
<code>(implies hyps conc)</code>, where <code>hyps</code> is the conjunction of the
top-level hypotheses and <code>conc</code> is the goal's conclusion.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  It is allowed to use abbreviations in the hints.
