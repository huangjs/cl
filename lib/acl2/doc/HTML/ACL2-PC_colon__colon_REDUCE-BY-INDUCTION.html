<h3>ACL2-PC::REDUCE-BY-INDUCTION</h3>(macro)
<code>   </code>call the ACL2 prover without induction, after going into
<code>   </code>induction
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
reduce-by-induction
  -- attempt to prove the current goal after going into induction,
     with no further inductions<p>

(reduce-by-induction ("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar))
  -- attempt to prove the current goal after going into induction,
     with no further inductions, using the indicated hints
<p>
General Form:
(reduce-by-induction &amp;rest hints)
</pre>

A subgoal will be created for each goal that would have been
pushed for proof by induction in an ordinary proof, except that the
proof begins with a top-level induction.<p>

Notice that unlike <code>prove</code>, the arguments to <code>reduce-by-induction</code> are
spread out, and are all hints.  See also <code>prove</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>bash</code>.<p>

<strong>Note</strong>:  Induction and the various processes will be used to the
extent that they are ordered explicitly in the <code>:induct</code> and <code>:do-not</code>
hints.
