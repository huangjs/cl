<h3>ACL2-PC::REDUCE</h3>(atomic macro)
<code>   </code>call the ACL2 theorem prover's simplifier
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
reduce -- attempt to prove the current goal without using induction
(reduce ("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar))
       -- attempt to prove the current goal without using
          induction, with the indicated hints
<p>
General Form:
(reduce &amp;rest hints)
</pre>

Attempt to prove the current goal without using induction, using the
indicated hints (if any).  A subgoal will be created for each goal
that would have been pushed for proof by induction in an ordinary
proof.<p>

Notice that unlike <code>prove</code>, the arguments to <code>reduce</code> are spread out,
and are all hints.<p>

<code>Reduce</code> is similar to <code>bash</code> in that neither of these allows induction.
But <code>bash</code> only allows simplification, while <code>reduce</code> allows processes
<code>eliminate-destructors</code>, <code>fertilize</code>, <code>generalize</code>, and
<code>eliminate-irrelevance</code>.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  Induction will be used to the extent that it is ordered
explicitly in the hints.
