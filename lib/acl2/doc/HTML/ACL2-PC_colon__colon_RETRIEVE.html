Must be used from <code>outside</code> the interactive proof-checker loop.  If
name is supplied and not <code>nil</code>, this causes re-entry to the
interactive proof-checker loop in the state at which <code>save</code> was last
executed for the indicated name.  (See documentation for <code>save</code>.)  If
<code>name</code> is <code>nil</code> or is not supplied, then the user is queried regarding
which proof-checker state to re-enter.  The query is omitted,
however, if there only one proof-checker state is present that was
saved with <code>save</code>, in which case that is the one that is used.  See
also <code>unsave</code>.
