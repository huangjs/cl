<code>   </code>simplify the current subterm
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>

<pre>
Examples:
S  -- simplify the current subterm
(S :backchain-limit 2 :normalize t :expand (append x z))
   -- simplify the current subterm, but during the rewriting
      process first ``normalize'' it by pushing IFs to the
      top-level, and also force the term (append x z) to be
      expanded during the rewriting process
<p>
General Form:
(s &amp;key rewrite normalize backchain-limit repeat in-theory hands-off
        expand)
</pre>

Simplify the current subterm according to the keyword parameters
supplied.  First if-normalization is applied (unless the <code>normalize</code>
argument is <code>nil</code>), i.e., each subterm of the form
<code>(f ... (if test x y) ...)</code>  is replaced by the term
<code>(if test (f ... x ...) (f ... y ...))</code>  except, of course, when
<code>f</code> is <code>if</code> and the indicated <code>if</code> subterm is in the second or
third argument position.  Then rewriting is applied (unless the
rewrite argument is <code>nil</code>).  Finally this pair of actions is
repeated -- until the rewriting step causes no change in the term.
A description of each parameter follows.

<pre>
:rewrite -- default t
</pre>

When non-<code>nil</code>, instructs the system to use ACL2's rewriter (or,
something close to it) during simplification.

<pre>
:normalize -- default t
</pre>

When non-<code>nil</code>, instructs the system to use if-normalization (as
described above) during simplification.

<pre>
:backchain-limit -- default 0
</pre>

Sets the number of recursive calls to the rewriter that are
allowed for backchaining.  Even with the default of 0, some
reasoning is allowed (technically speaking, type-set reasoning is
allowed) in the relieving of hypotheses.

<pre>
:repeat -- default 0
</pre>

Sets the number of times the current term is to be rewritten.  If
this value is <code>t</code>, then the default is used (as specified by the
constant <code>*default-s-repeat-limit*</code>).

<pre>
:in-theory, :hands-off, :expand
</pre>

These have their usual meaning; see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  if conditional rewrite rules are used that cause case splits
because of the use of <code>force</code>, then appropriate new subgoals will be
created, i.e., with the same current subterm (and address) but with
each new (forced) hypothesis being negated and then used to create a
corresponding new subgoal.  In that case, the current goal will have
all such new hypotheses added to the list of top-level hypotheses.
