Each instruction in the list <code>instruction-list</code> is run, and the
instruction ``succeeds'' if every instruction in <code>instruction-list</code>
``succeeds''.  However, it might ``succeed'' even if some
instructions in the list ``fail''; more generally, the various
arguments control a number of aspects of the running of the
instructions.  All this is explained in the paragraphs below.  First
we embark on a general discussion of the instruction interpreter,
including the notions of ``succeed'' and ``fail''.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong>  The arguments are <strong>not</strong> evaluated, except (in a sense) for
<code>success-expr</code>, as described below.<p>

Each primitive and meta instruction can be thought of as returning
an error triple (in the standard ACL2 sense), say <code>(erp val state)</code>.
An instruction (primitive or meta) ``succeeds'' if <code>erp</code> is <code>nil</code> and
<code>val</code> is not <code>nil</code>; otherwise it ``fails''.  (When we use the words
``succeed'' or ``fail'' in this technical sense, we'll always
include them in double quotes.)  If an instruction ``fails,'' we say
that that the failure is ``soft'' if <code>erp</code> is <code>nil</code>; otherwise the
failure is ``hard''.  The <code>sequence</code> command gives the user control
over how to treat ``success'' and ``failure'' when sequencing
instructions, though we have created a number of handy macro
commands for this purpose, notably <code>do-all</code>, <code>do-strict</code> and <code>protect</code>.<p>

Here is precisely what happens when a <code>sequence</code> instruction is run.
The instruction interpreter is run on the instructions supplied in
the argument <code>instruction-list</code> (in order).  The interpreter halts the
first time there is a hard ``failure.'' except that if <code>strict-flg</code> is
supplied and not <code>nil</code>, then the interpreter halts the first time
there is any ``failure.''  The error triple <code>(erp val state)</code> returned
by the <code>sequence</code> instruction is the triple returned by the last
instruction executed (or, the triple <code>(nil t state)</code> if
<code>instruction-list</code> is <code>nil</code>), except for the following provision.  If
<code>success-expr</code> is supplied and not <code>nil</code>, then it is evaluated with the
state global variables <code>erp</code> and <code>val</code> (in ACL2 package) bound to the
corresponding components of the error triple returned (as described
above).  At least two values should be returned, and the first two
of these will be substituted for <code>erp</code> and <code>val</code> in the triple finally
returned by <code>sequence</code>.  For example, if <code>success-expr</code> is <code>(mv erp val)</code>,
then no change will be made to the error triple, and if instead it
is <code>(mv nil t)</code>, then the <code>sequence</code> instruction will ``succeed''.<p>

That concludes the description of the error triple returned by a
<code>sequence</code> instruction, but it remains to explain the effects of the
arguments <code>protect-flg</code> and <code>no-prompt-flg</code>.<p>

If <code>protect-flg</code> is supplied and not <code>nil</code> and if also the instruction
``fails'' (i.e., the error component of the triple is not <code>nil</code> or the
value component is <code>nil</code>), then the state is reverted so that the
proof-checker's state (including the behavior of <code>restore</code>) is set
back to what it was before the <code>sequence</code> instruction was executed.
Otherwise, unless <code>no-restore-flg</code> is set, the state is changed so
that the <code>restore</code> command will now undo the effect of this <code>sequence</code>
instruction (even if there were nested calls to <code>sequence</code>).<p>

Finally, as each instruction in <code>instruction-list</code> is executed, the
prompt and that instruction will be printed, unless the global state
variable <code>print-prompt-and-instr-flg</code> is unbound or <code>nil</code> and the
parameter <code>no-prompt-flg</code> is supplied and not <code>nil</code>.
