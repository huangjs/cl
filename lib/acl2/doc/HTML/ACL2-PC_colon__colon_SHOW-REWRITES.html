<pre>
Example:
show-rewrites
<p>
General Form:
(show-rewrites &amp;optional rule-id enabled-only-flg)
</pre>

Display rewrite rules whose left-hand side matches the current subterm.  This
command shows how the <code>rewrite</code> command can be applied.  If <code>rule-id</code> is
supplied and is a name (non-<code>nil</code> symbol) or a rune, then only the
corresponding rewrite rule(s) will be displayed, while if <code>rule-id</code> is a
positive integer <code>n</code>, then only the <code>n</code>th rule that would be in the list
is displayed.  In each case, the display will point out when a rule is
currently disabled (in the interactive environment), except that if
<code>enabled-only-flg</code> is supplied and not <code>nil</code>, then disabled rules will
not be displayed at all.  Finally, among the free variables of any rule (those
occurring in the rule that do not occur in the left-hand side of its
conclusion), those that would remain free if the rule were applied will be
displayed.  See also the documentation for <code>rewrite</code>.
