Print hypotheses and the current subterm.  The printing of
hypotheses (and perhaps governors) are controlled as in the <code>hyps</code>
command; see its documentation.<p>

Historical note:  The name <code>th</code> is adapted from the Gypsy Verification
Environment, where <code>th</code> abbreviates the command <code>theorem</code>, which
says to print information on the current goal.
