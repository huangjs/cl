<h3>ACL2-PC::TYPE-ALIST</h3>(macro)
<code>   </code>display the type-alist from the current context
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
(type-alist t t) ; display type-alist based on both conclusion and governors
type-alist       ; same as (type-alist nil t) -- governors only
(type-alist nil) ; same as (type-alist nil t) -- governors only
(type-alist t)   ; same as (type-alist t nil) -- conclusion only
(type-alist nil nil) ; display type-alist without considering
                     ; conclusion or governors
<p>
General Form:
(type-alist &amp;optional concl-flg govs-flg)
</pre>

where if <code>govs-flg</code> is omitted, it defaults to <code>(not concl-flg)</code>.<p>

Display the current assumptions as a type-alist.  Note that this
display includes the result of forward chaining.<p>

There are two basic reasons contemplated for using this command.<p>

1. The theorem prover has failed (either outside the proof-checker or using a
proof-checker command such as <code>bash</code> or <code>reduce</code> and you want to
debug by getting an idea of what the prover knows about the context.
<blockquote><p>

a. You really are interested in the context for the current term.  Include
hypotheses and governors (i.e., accounting for tests of surrounding
<code>if</code>-expressions that must be true or false) but not the current conclusion
(which the theorem prover's heuristics would generally ignore for contextual
information).  Command:<br>

<code>(type-alist nil t)</code> ; equivalently, <code>type-alist</code> or <code>(type-alist nil)</code><p>

b. You are not thinking in particular about the current term; you just want
to get an idea of the context that the prover would build at the top-level,
for forward-chaining.  Incorporate the conclusion but not the governors.
Command:<br>

<code>(type-alist t nil)</code> ; equivalently, <code>(type-alist t)</code></blockquote>
<p>

2. You intend to use one of the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">proof-checker-commands</a> that does
simplification, such as <code>s</code> or <code>x</code>, and you want to see the context.
Then include the surrounding <code>if</code>-term governors but not the goal's
conclusion.  Command:<br>

<code>(type-alist nil t)</code> ; equivalently, <code>type-alist</code> or <code>(type-alist nil)</code><p>

See <a href="TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> (also see <a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>) for information about
ACL2's type system, which can assist in understanding the output of the
<code>type-alist</code> command.
