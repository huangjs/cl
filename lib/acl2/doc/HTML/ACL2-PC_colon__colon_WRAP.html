<h3>ACL2-PC::WRAP</h3>(atomic macro)
<code>   </code>execute the indicated instructions and combine all the new goals
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
(wrap induct) ; induct, then replace first new goal by the conjunction of all
              ; the new goals, and drop all new goals after the first
<p>
General Form:
(wrap &amp;rest instrs)
</pre>

First the instructions in <code>instrs</code> are executed, as in <code>do-all</code>.  If this
``fails'' then no additional action is taken.  Otherwise, the current goal
after execution of <code>instrs</code> is conjoined with all ``new'' goals, in the
sense that their names are not among the names of goals at the time
<code>instrs</code> was begun.  This conjunction becomes the new current goal and
those ``new'' goals are dropped.<p>

See the code for the proof-checker command wrap-induct for an example of the
use of <code>wrap</code>.
