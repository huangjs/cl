<h3>ACL2-PC::X</h3>(atomic macro)
<code>   </code>expand and (maybe) simplify function call at the current subterm
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
x --  expand and simplify.
</pre>

For example, if the current subterm is (append a b), then after <code>x</code>
the current subterm will probably be (cons (car a) (append (cdr a)
b)) if (consp a) and (true-listp a) are among the top-level
hypotheses and governors.  If there are no top-level hypotheses and
governors, then after <code>x</code> the current subterm will probably be:

<pre>
(if (true-listp x)
    (if x
        (cons (car x) (append (cdr x) y))
      y)
  (apply 'binary-append (list x y))).
<p>
General Form:
(X &amp;key
   rewrite normalize backchain-limit in-theory hands-off expand)
</pre>

Expand the function call at the current subterm, and simplify
using the same conventions as with the <code>s</code> command (see documentation
for <code>s</code>).<p>

Unlike <code>s</code>, it is permitted to set both <code>:rewrite</code> and <code>:normalize</code> to
<code>nil</code>, which will result in no simplification; see <code>x-dumb</code>.<p>

<strong>Note</strong> (obscure):  On rare occasions the current address may be
affected by the use of <code>x</code>.  For example, suppose we have the
definition

<pre>
(defun g (x) (if (consp x) x 3))
</pre>

and then we enter the proof-checker with

<pre>
(verify (if (integerp x) (equal (g x) 3) t)) .
</pre>

Then after invoking the instruction <code>(dive 2 1)</code>, so that the
current subterm is <code>(g x)</code>, followed by the instruction <code>x</code>, we would
expect the conclusion to be <code>(if (integerp x) (equal 3 3) t)</code>.
However, the system actually replaces <code>(equal 3 3)</code> with <code>t</code> (because we
use the ACL2 term-forming primitives), and hence the conclusion is
actually <code>(if (integerp x) (equal 3 3) t)</code>.  Therefore, the current
address is put at <code>(2)</code> rather than <code>(2 1)</code>.  In such cases, a warning
``<code>NOTE</code>'' will be printed to the terminal.<p>

The other primitive commands to which the above ``truncation'' note
applies are <code>equiv</code>, <code>rewrite</code>, and <code>s</code>.
