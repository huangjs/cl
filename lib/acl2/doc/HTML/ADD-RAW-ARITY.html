<h3>ADD-RAW-ARITY</h3>add arity information for raw mode
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="SET-RAW-MODE.html">SET-RAW-MODE</a>
</pre><p>

Technical note: This macro is a no-op, and is not necessary, when ACL2 is
built with #-acl2-mv-as-values.<p>

Users of raw mode (see <a href="SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>) can use arbitrary raw Lisp functions
that are not known inside the usual ACL2 loop.  In such cases, ACL2 may not
know how to display a multiple value returned by ACL2's <code><a href="MV.html">mv</a></code> macro.  The
following example should make this clear.

<pre>
ACL2 P&gt;(defun foo (x y) (mv y x))
FOO
ACL2 P&gt;(foo 3 4)<p>

Note: Unable to compute number of values returned by this evaluation
because function FOO is not known in the ACL2 logical world.  Presumably
it was defined in raw Lisp or in raw mode.  Returning the first (perhaps
only) value for calls of FOO.
4
ACL2 P&gt;(add-raw-arity foo 2)
 RAW-ARITY-ALIST
ACL2 P&gt;(foo 3 4)
(4 3)
ACL2 P&gt;
</pre>

The first argument of <code>add-raw-arity</code> should be a symbol, representing the
name of a function, macro, or special form, and the second argument should
either be a non-negative integer (denoting the number of values returned by
ACL2) or else the symbol <code>:LAST</code>, meaning that the number of values
returned by the call is the number of values returned by the last
argument.
<p>
The current arity assignments can be seen by evaluating
<code>(@ raw-arity-alist)</code>.  See <a href="REMOVE-RAW-ARITY.html">remove-raw-arity</a> for how to undo a call of
<code>add-raw-arity</code>.
