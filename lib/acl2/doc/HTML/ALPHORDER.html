<h2>ALPHORDER</h2>total order on atoms

<code>Alphorder</code> is a non-strict total order, a ``less than or equal,'' on
atoms.  By ``non-strict total order'' we mean a function that always
returns <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> and satisfies the following properties.
<blockquote><p>

o Antisymmetry:  <code>XrY &amp; YrX -&gt; X=Y</code><p>

o Transitivity:  <code>XrY &amp; YrZ -&gt; XrZ</code><p>

o Trichotomy:  <code>XrY v YrX</code><p>

</blockquote>
Also see <a href="LEXORDER.html">lexorder</a>, which extends <code>alphorder</code> to all objects.<p>

<code>(Alphorder x y)</code> has a guard of <code>(and (atom x) (atom y))</code>.
<p>
Within a single type: rationals are compared arithmetically, complex
rationals are compared lexicographically, characters are compared
via their char-codes, and strings and symbols are compared with
alphabetic ordering.  Across types, rationals come before complexes,
complexes come before characters, characters before strings, and
strings before symbols.  We also allow for ``bad atoms,'' i.e.,
atoms that are not legal Lisp objects but make sense in the ACL2
logic; these come at the end, after symbols.
