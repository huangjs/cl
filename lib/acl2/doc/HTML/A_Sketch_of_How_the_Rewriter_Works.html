<h2>A Sketch of How the Rewriter Works</h2>
<p>
Below we show the first target term, extracted from the
current conjecture.  Below it we show the associativity rule.<p>

The variables of the rewrite rule are <b>instantiated</B> so that the
<b>left-hand side</B> of the rule matches the target:<p>


<pre>
     variable          term from target
       a                     x1
       b                     x2
       c                     (app x3 x4)
</pre>
<p>

Then the target is <b>replaced</B> by the instantiated <b>right-hand side</B>
of the rule.<p>

Sometimes rules have <b>hypotheses</B>.  To make a long story short, 
if the rule has hypotheses, then after matching the left-hand side,
the rewriter instantiates the hypotheses and rewrites them recursively.
This is called <b>backchaining</B>.  If they all rewrite to true, then
the target is replaced as above.<p>

book <b>A Computational Logic</B>, Academic Press, 1979.
