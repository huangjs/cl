<h2>A Tiny Warning Sign</h2>
<p>
<img src=warning.gif><p>

 This warning sign, which usually appears as ``<img src=twarning.gif>'',
 indicates that the link it marks takes you into ACL2's online
 documentation.<p>

 The documentation is a vast graph of documented topics intended to
 help the <em>user</em> of ACL2 rather than the <em>potential user</em>.  If
 you are exploring ACL2's home page to learn about the system,
 perhaps you should go back rather than follow the link marked with
 this sign.  But you are welcome to explore the online documentation
 as well.  Good luck.
