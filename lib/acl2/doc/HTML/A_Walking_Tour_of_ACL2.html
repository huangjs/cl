<h2>A Walking Tour of ACL2</h2>
<p>

On this tour you will learn a little more about the ACL2 logic, the theorem
prover, and the user interface.<p>

This time we will stick with really simple things, such as the
associativity of list concatenation.<p>

We assume you have taken the Flying Tour but that you did not necessarily
follow all the ``off-tour'' links.  So this tour may revisit some pages
you've seen.  Just click on the Walking Tour icon at the bottom of each
page.<p>

On this tour you will see many more links marked <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>.  We would
like to <b>discourage</B> you from following these links right
now.  However we <b>encourage</B> you to <b>note them</B>.  Basically, the
<a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> sign here illustrates the documentation and introduces you to
its main entry points.  Once you have started to <b>use</B> ACL2 you can
take the Walking Tour again but pursue more of the indicated links.<p>
