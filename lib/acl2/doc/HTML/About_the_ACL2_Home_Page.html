<h2>About the ACL2 Home Page</h2>
<p>
The ACL2 Home Page is integrated into the ACL2 online documentation.
Over 1.5 megabytes of text is available here.<p>

The vast majority of the text
is user-level documentation.  For example, to find out about <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>
<a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> rules you could click on the word ``<a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>.''
<b>But before you do that</B> remember that you must then use your browser's
<b>back</B> commands to come back here.<p>

The tiny warning signs <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> mark pointers that lead out of the
introductory-level material and into the user documentation.  If you are
taking the Flying Tour, we advise you to <b>avoid</B> following such pointers the
first time; it is easy to get lost in the full documentation unless
you are pursuing the answer to a specific question.  If you do wander down
these other paths, remember you can <b>back</B> out to a page containing the
Flying Tour icon to resume the tour.<p>

At the end of the tour you will have a chance to return to
<a href="A_Flying_Tour_of_ACL2.html">The Flight Plan</a> where you can revisit the main stops of
the Flying Tour and explore the alternative paths more fully.<p>

Finally, every page contains two icons at the bottom.  The ACL2 icon leads
you back to the ACL2 Home Page.  The Index icon allows you to browse an
alphabetical listing of all the topics in ACL2's online documentation.<p>
