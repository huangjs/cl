<h2>About the Admission of Recursive Definitions</h2>

You can't just add any formula as an axiom or definition and expect
the logic to stay sound!  The purported ``definition'' of <code>APP</code>
must have several properties to be admitted to the logic as a new
axiom
<p>
The key property a recursive definition must have is that the recursion
terminate.  This, along with some syntactic criteria, ensures us that there
exists a function satisfying the definition.<p>

Termination must be proved before the definition is admitted.  This is
done in general by finding a measure of the arguments of the function and
a well-founded relation such that the arguments ``get smaller'' every time
a recursive branch is taken.<p>

For <code>app</code> the measure is the ``size'' of the first argument, <code>x</code>,
as determined by the primitive function <code><a href="ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>.  The
well-founded relation used in this example is <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>
<a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>, which is the standard ordering on the ordinals less than
``epsilon naught.''  These particular choices for <code>app</code> were made
``automatically'' by ACL2.  But they are in fact determined by
various ``default'' settings.  The user of ACL2 can change the
defaults or specify a ``hint'' to the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> command to
specify the measure and relation.<p>
