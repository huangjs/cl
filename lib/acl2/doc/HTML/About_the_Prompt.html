<h2>About the Prompt</h2>

The string ``<code>ACL2 !&gt;</code>'' is the ACL2 prompt.
<p>
The prompt tells the user that an ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>is expected.  In
addition, the prompt tells us a little about the current state of
the ACL2 command interpreter.  We explain the prompt briefly below.
But first we talk about the command interpreter.<p>

An ACL2 command is generally a Lisp expression to be evaluated.
There are some unusual commands (such as :<a href="Q.html">q</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> for <b>quitting</B>
ACL2) which cause other behavior.  But most commands are read,
evaluated, and then have their results printed.  Thus, we call the
command interpreter a ``read-eval-print loop.''  The ACL2 command
interpreter is named <code><a href="LD.html">LD</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> (after Lisp's ``load'').<p>

A command like <b>(defun app (x y) ...)</B> causes ACL2 to evaluate the
<a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> function on <b>app</B>, <b>(x y)</B> and <b>...</B>.  When
that command is evaluated it prints some information to the terminal
explaining the processing of the proposed definition.  It returns
the symbol <code>APP</code> as its value, which is printed by the command
interpreter.  (Actually, <code>defun</code> is not a function but a <a href="DEFMACRO.html">macro</a>
which expands to a form that involves <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>, a necessary
precondition to printing output to the terminal and to ``changing''
the set of axioms.  But we do not discuss this further here.)<p>

The <code>defun</code> command is an example of a special kind of command
called an ``event.''  <a href="EVENTS.html">Events</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> are those commands that
change the ``logical world'' by adding such things as axioms or
theorems to ACL2's data base.  See <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>.  But not
every command is an event command.<p>

A command like <b>(app '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6 7))</B> is an example of a
non-event.  It is processed the same general way:  the function
<b>app</B> is applied to the indicated arguments and the result is
printed.  The function <b>app</B> does not print anything and does not
change the ``world.''<p>

A third kind of command are those that display information about the
current logical world or that ``backup'' to previous versions of the
world.  Such commands are called ``<a href="HISTORY.html">history</a>'' <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> commands.<p>

What does the ACL2 prompt tell us about the read-eval-print loop?
The prompt ``<code>ACL2 !&gt;</code>'' tells us that the command will be read
with <code><a href="CURRENT-PACKAGE.html">current-package</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> set to <code>"ACL2"</code>, that guard checking
(see <a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a>) is on (``<code>!</code>''), and that we are at
the top-level (there is only one ``<code>&gt;</code>'').
