<h2>BOOK-EXAMPLE</h2>how to create, certify, and use a simple book
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BOOKS.html">BOOKS</a>
</pre><p>

Suppose you have developed a sequence of admissible <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> which you
want to turn into a book.  We call this ``publishing'' the book.
This note explains how to do that.
<p>
A key idea of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> is that they are ``incremental'' in the
sense that when you include a book in a host logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, the
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> is incrementally extended by the results established in that
book.  This is allowed only if every name defined by the incoming
book is either new or is already identically defined.
See <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>.  This is exactly the same problem faced
by a programmer who wishes to provide a utility to other people: how
can he make sure he doesn't create name conflicts?  The solution, in
Common Lisp, is also the same: use packages.  While <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> and
packages have a very tenuous formal connection (every book must
start with an <code><a href="IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></code>), the creation of a book is intimately
concerned with the package issue.  Having motivated what would
otherwise appear as an unnecessary fascination with packages below,
we now proceed with a description of how to publish a book.<p>

Just to be concrete, let's suppose you have already gotten ACL2 to
accept the following sequence of <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s, starting in the ACL2
initial <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.

<pre>
   (defpkg "ACL2-MY-BOOK"
           (union-eq *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*
                     *acl2-exports*))
   (in-package "ACL2-MY-BOOK")
   (defun app (x y)
     (if (consp x) (cons (car x) (app (cdr x) y)) y))
   (defun rev (x)
     (if (consp x) (app (rev (cdr x)) (list (car x))) nil))
   (defthm rev-app-hack
     (equal (rev (app a (list x))) (cons x (rev a))))
   (defthm rev-rev 
     (implies (acl2::true-listp x) (equal (rev (rev x)) x)))
</pre>

Observe that the first form above defines a package (which imports
the symbols defined in CLTL such as <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code> and <code><a href="CONS.html">cons</a></code> and the
symbols used to <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> ACL2 such as <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>).  The
second form selects that package as the current one.  All subsequent
forms are read into that package.  The remaining forms are just
event forms: <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>s and <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>s in this case.<p>

Typically you would have created a file with Emacs containing these
forms and you will have submitted each of them interactively to ACL2
to confirm that they are all admissible.  That interactive
verification should start in ACL2's initial <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> -- although
you might, of course, start your sequence of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> with some
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>s to build a more elaborate <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.<p>

The first step towards publishing a book containing the results
above is to create a file that starts with the <code><a href="IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></code> and
then contains the rest of the forms.  Let's call that file
<code>"my-book.lisp"</code>.  The name is unimportant, except it must end
with <code>".lisp"</code>.  If there are <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that you do not wish to be
available to the user of the book -- e.g., lemmas you proved on your
way toward proving the main ones -- you may so mark them by
enclosing them in <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> forms.  See <a href="LOCAL.html">local</a>.  Let us suppose
you wish to hide <code>rev-app-hack</code> above.  You may also add standard Lisp
comments to the file.  The final content of <code>"my-book.lisp"</code>
might be:

<pre>
 ; This book contains my app and rev functions and the theorem
 ; that rev is its own inverse.<p>

   (in-package "ACL2-MY-BOOK")
   (defun app (x y)
     (if (consp x) (cons (car x) (app (cdr x) y)) y))
   (defun rev (x)
     (if (consp x) (app (rev (cdr x)) (list (car x))) nil))<p>

 ; The following hack is not exported.
   (local (defthm rev-app-hack
     (equal (rev (app a (list x))) (cons x (rev a)))))<p>

   (defthm rev-rev 
     (implies (acl2::true-listp x) (equal (rev (rev x)) x)))
</pre>

The file shown above <strong>is</strong> the book.  By the time this note is
done you will have seen how to certify that the book is correct, how
to compile it, and how to use it in other host <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s.  Observe that
the <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> is not in the book.  It cannot be: Common Lisp
compilers disagree on how to treat new package definitions appearing
in files to be compiled.<p>

Since a book is just a source file typed by the user, ACL2 provides
a mechanism for checking that the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> are all admissible and then
marking the file as checked.  This is called certification.  To
certify <code>"my-book.lisp"</code> you should first get into ACL2 with an
initial <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Then, define the package needed by the book, by
typing the following <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> to the ACL2 <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(defpkg "ACL2-MY-BOOK"
               (union-eq *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*
                         *acl2-exports*))
</pre>

Then execute the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(certify-book "my-book" 1 t) ; the `t' is in fact the default
</pre>

Observe that you do not type the <code>".lisp"</code> part of the file
name.  For purposes of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>, the book's name is <code>"my-book"</code> and
by the time all is said and done, there will be several extensions
in addition to the <code>".lisp"</code> extension associated with it.<p>

The <code>1</code> tells <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> that you acknowledge that there is
one command in this ``certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>'' (namely the <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>).
To use the book, any prospective host <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> must be extended by
the addition of whatever <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s occurred before certification.  It
would be a pity to certify a book in a <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> containing junk because
that junk will become the ``<a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>'' guarding entrance to
the book.  The <code>t</code> above tells <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> that you wish to
compile <code>"my-book.lisp"</code> also.  <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></code> makes many checks
but by far the most important and time-consuming one is that it
``proves'' every event in the file.<p>

When <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is done it will have created two new files.
The first will be called <code>"my-book.cert"</code> and contains the
``<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>'' attesting to the admissibility of the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in
<code>"my-book.lisp"</code>.  The <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> contains the <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> and any
other forms necessary to construct the certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  It also
contains various check sums used to help you keep track of which
version of <code>"my-book.lisp"</code> was certified.<p>

The second file created by <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is the compiled version
of <code>"my-book.lisp"</code> and will have a name that is assigned by the
host compiler (e.g., <code>"my-book.o"</code> in AKCL, <code>"my-book.lbin"</code>
or <code>"my-book.sbin"</code> in Lucid).  <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></code> will also load
this object file.  When <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is done, you may throw away
the logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> it created, for example by executing the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> <code>:u</code>.<p>

To use the book later in any ACL2 session, just execute the event
<code>(include-book "my-book")</code>.  This will do the necessary
<code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>, load the non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in <code>"my-book.lisp"</code> and
then load the compiled code for the non-local functions defined in
that file.  Checks are made to ensure that the <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file
exists and describes the version of <code>"my-book.lisp"</code> that is
read.  The compiled code is loaded if and only if it exists and has
a later write date than the source file.<p>

Since <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is itself an event, you may put such forms
into other <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  Thus it is possible for the inclusion of a single
book to lead to the inclusion of many others.  The check sum
information maintained in <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s helps deal with the
version control problem of the referenced <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  I.e., if this
version of <code>"my-book"</code> is used during the certification of
<code>"your-book"</code>, then the <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for <code>"your-book"</code> includes
the check sum of this version of <code>"my-book"</code>.  If a later
<code>(include-book "your-book")</code> finds a version of <code>"my-book"</code>
with a different check sum, an error is signalled.  But check sums
are not perfect and the insecurity of the host file system prevents
ACL2 from guaranteeing the logical soundness of an <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>
event, even for a book that appears to have a valid <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>
(they can be forged, after all).  (See <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for further
discussion.)<p>

This concludes the example of how to create, certify and use a book.
If you wish, you could now review the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for book-related
topics (see <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>) and browse through them.  They'll probably
make sense in this context.  Alternatively, you could continue the
``guided tour'' through the rest of the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.
See <a href="BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>, following the pointer given at the conclusion.
