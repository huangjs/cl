<h2>BOOK-MAKEFILES</h2>makefile support provided with the ACL2 distribution
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BOOKS.html">BOOKS</a>
</pre><p>

This topic describes the ACL2 methodology for using makefiles to assist in
the automation of the certification of collections of ACL2 <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  We
assume here a familiarity with Unix/Linux <code>make</code>.  We also assume that you
are using GNU <code>make</code> rather than some other flavor of <code>make</code>.
<p>
ACL2's regression suite is run using <code>Makefile</code>s that include
<code>books/Makefile-generic</code>.  You can look at existing <code>Makefile</code>s to
understand how to create your own <code>Makefile</code>s.  Here are the seven steps to
follow to create a <code>Makefile</code> for a directory that contains books to be
certified, and certify them using that <code>Makefile</code>.  Below these steps we
conclude with discussion of other capabilties provided by
<code>books/Makefile-generic</code>.<p>

1. Include the file <code>books/Makefile-generic</code>.  For example, if you look at
<code>books/misc/Makefile</code> then you'll see that it starts with this line:

<pre>
include ../Makefile-generic
</pre>

Note that <code>../</code> should be replaced by the appropriate path to
<code>books/Makefile-generic</code>.  AND PLEASE NOTE:  This <code>include</code> line should
precede the lines mentioned below.<p>

2. Define the <code>ACL2</code> variable.  For example, file
<code>books/arithmetic-3/pass1/Makefile</code> starts as follows.

<pre>
include ../../Makefile-generic
ACL2 = ../../../saved_acl2
</pre>

Note that you will need to provide the appropriate path to your ACL2
executable.<p>

3. (Optional; usually skipped.)  Set the <code>INHIBIT</code> variable if you want to
see more than the summary output.  For example, if you want to see the same
output as you would normally see at the terminal, put this line in your
Makefile after the <code>include</code> and <code>ACL2</code> lines.

<pre>
INHIBIT = (assign inhibit-output-lst (list (quote proof-tree)))
</pre>

For other values to use for <code>INHIBIT</code>, see <a href="SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> and see
the original setting of <code>INHIBIT</code> in <code>books/Makefile-generic</code>.<p>

4. Specify the books to be certified.  If every file with extension <code>.lisp</code>
is a book that you want to certify, you can skip this step.  Otherwise, put a
line in your <code>Makefile</code> after the ones above that specifies the books to be
certified.  The following example, from
<code>books/finite-set-theory/osets/Makefile</code>, should make this clear.

<pre>
BOOKS = computed-hints fast instance map membership outer primitives \
        quantify set-order sets sort
</pre>
  <p>

5. Create <code>.acl2</code> files for books that are to be certified in other than
the initial ACL2 world (see <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>).  For example, if you look in
<code>books/arithmetic/equalities.acl2</code> you will see <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> forms followed
by a <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> command, because it was determined that <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>
forms were necessary in the certification world in order to certify the
<code>equalities</code> book.  In general, for each <code>&lt;book-name&gt;.lisp</code> whose
certification requires a non-initial certification world, you will need a
corresponding <code>&lt;book-name&gt;.acl2</code> file that ends with the appropriate
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> command.  Of course, you can also use <code>.acl2</code> files with
initial certification worlds, for example if you want to pass optional
arguments to <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>.<p>

You also have the option of creating a file <code>cert.acl2</code> that has a special
role.  When file <code>&lt;book-name&gt;.lisp</code> is certified, if there is no file
<code>&lt;book-name&gt;.acl2</code> but there is a file <code>cert.acl2</code>, then <code>cert.acl2</code>
will be used as <code>&lt;book-name&gt;.acl2</code> would have been used, as described in
the preceding paragraph, except that the appropriate <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>
command will be generated automatically -- no <code>certify-book</code> command
should occur in <code>cert.acl2</code>.<p>

It is actually allowed to put raw lisp forms in a <code>.acl2</code> file (presumably
preceded by <code>:q</code> or <code>(value :q)</code> and followed by <code>(lp)</code>).  But this is
not recommended; we make no guarantees about certification performed any time
after raw Lisp has been entered in the ACL2 session.<p>

6. Run the following command:

<pre>
make dependencies
</pre>

This will generate dependency information.  If you try it in <code>books/misc/</code>,
the result should agree with what you find in <code>books/misc/Makefile</code>.  If
you run this in the directory you are developing, you will want to insert the
output at the end of your <code>Makefile</code>.<p>

7. Run <code>make</code>.  This will generate a <code>&lt;book-name&gt;.out</code> file for each
<code>&lt;book-name&gt;.lisp</code> file being certified, which is the result of redirecting
ACL2's standard output.  Note that <code>make</code> will stop at the first failure,
but you can use <code>make -i</code> to force make to continue past failures.  You can
also use the <code>-j</code> option to speed things up if you have a multi-core
machine.<p>

That concludes the basic instructions for creating a <code>Makefile</code> in a
directory including books.  Here are some other capabilities offered by
<code>books/Makefile-subdirs</code>.<p>

<strong>Subdirectory support.</strong>  There is support for the case that there are no
books in the current directory, but there are subdirectories that include
books (or themselves have no books but contain subdirectories with books,
etc.)  For example, file <code>books/arithmetic-3/Makefile</code> has the following
contents.

<pre>
DIRS = pass1 bind-free floor-mod
include ../Makefile-subdirs
</pre>

This indicates that we are to run <code>make</code> in subdirectories <code>pass1/</code>,
<code>bind-free/</code>, and <code>floor-mod</code> of the current directory
(namely, <code>books/arithmetic-3/</code>).  Use <code>Makefile-psubdirs</code> instead of
<code>Makefile-subdirs</code> if certitification of a book in a subdirectory never
depends on certification of a book in a different subdirectory, because then
<code>make</code>'s <code>-j</code> option can allow subdirectories to be processed in
parallel.<p>

<strong>Cleaning up.</strong>  We note that there is a <code>clean</code> target.  Thus,

<pre>
make clean
</pre>

will remove all <code>.cert</code> files, files resulting from compilation, and other
``junk''; see the full list under ``<code>clean:</code>'' in
<code>books/Makefile-generic</code>.<p>

<strong>Compilation support.</strong>  Finally, <code>books/Makefile-generic</code> provides
support for compiling books that are already certified.  For example, suppose
that you have certified books in GCL, resulting in compiled files with the
<code>.o</code> extension.  Now suppose you would like to compile the books for
Allegro Common Lisp, whose compiled files have the <code>.fasl</code> extension.  The
following command will work if you have included <code>books/Makefile-generic</code>
in your <code>Makefile</code>.

<pre>
make fasl
</pre>

In general, the compiled file extension for a Lisp supported by ACL2 will be
a target name for building compiled files for all your books (after
certifying the books, if not already up-to-date on certification).
