<h2>BOOK-NAME</h2>conventions associated with book names
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BOOKS.html">BOOKS</a>

<pre>
Examples:
"list-processing"
"/usr/home/smith/my-arith"
</pre>

Book names are string constants that can be elaborated into file
names.  We elaborate book names by concatenating the ``connected
book directory'' (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>) string on the left and some
``extension,'' such as <code>".lisp"</code>, on the right.  However, the
connected book directory is not added if the book name itself
already represents an absolute file name.  Furthermore,
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> and <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> temporarily reset the connected
book directory to be the directory of the book being processed.
This allows <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> forms to use file names without explicit
mention of the enclosing book's directory.  This in turn allows
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> (together with those that they include, using
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>) to be moved between directories while maintaining
their certification and utility.<p>

You may wish to read elsewhere for details of ACL2 file name
conventions (see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>), for a discussion of the filename
that is the result of the elaboration described here
(see <a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>), and for details of the concept of the
connected book directory (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>).  For details of how
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> (see <a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>) and <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>
(see <a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>) use these concepts, see below.
<p>
Often a book name is simply the familiar name of the file.
(See <a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> for discussion of the notions of
``directory string,'' ``familiar name,'' and ``extension''.  These
concepts are not on the guided tour through <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> and you
should read them separately.)  However, it is permitted for book
names to include a directory or part of a directory name.  Book
names never include the extension, since ACL2 must routinely tack
several different extensions onto the name during <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.
For example, <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> uses the <code>".lisp"</code>, <code>".cert"</code> and
possibly the <code>".o"</code> or <code>".lbin"</code> extensions of the book name.<p>

Book names are elaborated into full file names by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>
and <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>.  This elaboration is sensitive to the
``connected book directory.'' The connected book directory is an
absolute filename string (see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>) that is part of the
ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  (You may wish to see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a> and to
see <a href="SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a> -- note that these are not on the guided tour).
If a book name is an absolute filename string, ACL2 elaborates it
simply by appending the desired extension to the right.
If a book name is a relative filename string, ACL2 appends the
connected book directory on the left and the desired extension on
the right.<p>

Note that it is possible that the book name includes some partial
specification of the directory.  For example, if the connected book
directory is <code>"/usr/home/smith/"</code> then the book name
<code>"project/task-1/arith"</code> is a book name that will be elaborated
to

<pre>
"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp".
</pre>
<p>

Observe that while the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in this <code>"arith"</code> book are being
processed the connected book directory will temporarily be set to

<pre>
"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/".
</pre>

Thus, if the book requires other <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>, e.g.,

<pre>
(include-book "naturals")
</pre>

then it is not necessary to specify the directory on which they
reside provided that directory is the same as the superior book.<p>

This inheritance of the connected book directory and its use to
elaborate the names of inferior <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> makes it possible to move
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> and their inferiors to new directories, provided they maintain
the same relative relationship.  It is even possible to move with
ease whole collections of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> to different filesystems that use
a different operating system than the one under which the original
certification was performed.<p>

The <code>".cert"</code> extension of a book, if it exists, is presumed to
contain the most recent <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for the book.
See <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> (or, if you are on the guided tour, wait until
the tour gets there).<p>
