This documentation topic is about ACL2 input files.  However, there are two
traditional (paper) books published about ACL2:  a textbook and a case
studies book.  Further information is available by following links from the
ACL2 home page, <code>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/</code>.  Now, on to
the real content of this topic:<p>

A ``book'' is a file of ACL2 <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that have been certified as
admissible.  Using <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> you can construct a new logical
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> by assuming the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in any number of mutually compatible
books.  Relevant documented topics are listed below.  Following this list
is a ``guided tour'' through the topics.

<em>Introduction.</em><p>

A ``book'' is a file of ACL2 forms.  Books are prepared entirely by
the user of the system, i.e., they are ``source'' files not
``object'' files.  Some of the forms in a book are marked <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>
and the others are considered ``non-local.''<p>

<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></code> lets you load a book into any ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  If
completed without error, the inclusion of a book extends the logic
of the host <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> by the addition of just the non-local <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in
the book.  You may extend the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> by successively including a
variety of books to obtain the desired collection of definitions and
rules.  Unless name conflicts occur (which are detected and
signalled) inclusion of a book is consistency preserving provided
the book itself is consistent as discussed later.  However,
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> merely assumes the validity of the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in a book;
if you include a book that contains an inconsistency (e.g., an
inadmissible definition) then the resulting theory is inconsistent.<p>

It is possible to ``certify'' a book, with <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>,
guaranteeing that the error-free inclusion of the certified forms
will produce a consistent extension of a consistent logic.
Certification processes both the <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> and non-local forms, so
you can mark as <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> those <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> you need for certification
that you want to hide from users of the book (e.g., hacks, crocks,
and kludges on the way to a good set of <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rules).
Certification can also ``compile'' a book, thereby speeding up the
execution of the functions defined within it.  The desire to compile
books is largely responsible for the restrictions we put on the
forms allowed in books.<p>

Extensive <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> is available on the various aspects of
books.  We recommend that you read it all before using books.  It
has been written so as to make sense when read in a certain linear
sequence, called the ``guided tour'', though in general you may
browse through it randomly.  If you are on the guided tour, you
should next read the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> on book-example
(see <a href="BOOK-EXAMPLE.html">book-example</a>).
