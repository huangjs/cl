<h2>BREAK-LEMMA</h2>a quick introduction to breaking rewrite rules in ACL2
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">BREAK-REWRITE</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
:brr t                          ; if you haven't done that yet
:monitor (:rewrite lemma12) t   ; to install a break point on the
                                ; rule named (:rewrite lemma12)
</pre>

<p>
ACL2 does not support Nqthm's <code>break-lemma</code> but supports a very
similar and more powerful break facility.  Suppose some proof is
failing; apparently some particular rule is not being used and you
wish to learn why.  Then you need the ACL2 <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> facility.
See <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> and all of its associated <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> topics for
details.  The following basic steps are required.<p>

(1) To enable the ``break rewrite'' feature, you must first execute

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:brr t
</pre>

at the top-level of ACL2.  Equivalently, evaluate <code>(brr t)</code>.
<a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">Break-rewrite</a> stays enabled until you disable it with <code>(brr nil)</code>.
When <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> is enabled the ACL2 rewriter will run slower than
normal but you will be able to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the attempts to apply
specified rules.<p>

(2) Decide what <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s (see <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>) you wish to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>.  For
example, you might want to know why <code>(:rewrite lemma12 . 2)</code> is not
being used in the attempted proof.  That, by the way, is the name of
the second rewrite rule generated from the event named <code>lemma12</code>.<p>

The command

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite lemma12 . 2) t
</pre>

will install an ``unconditional'' break point on that rule.  The
``<code>t</code>'' at the end of the command means it is unconditional, i.e., a
break will occur every time the rule is tried.  ACL2 supports
conditional breaks also, in which case the <code>t</code> is replaced by an
expression that evaluates to non-<code>nil</code> when you wish for a break to
occur.  See <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>.  The above keyword command is, of course,
equivalent to

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(monitor '(:rewrite lemma12 . 2) t)
</pre>

which you may also type.  You may install breaks on as many rules
as you wish.  You must use <code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code> on each rule.  You may also
change the break condition on a rule with <code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code>.  Use <code><a href="UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></code>
(see <a href="UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a>) to remove a rule from the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed
rules.<p>

(3) Then try the proof again.  When a <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rule is tried by the
rewriter you will enter an interactive break, called <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>.
See <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for a detailed description.  Very simply,
<a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> lets you inspect the context of the attempted
application both before and after the attempt.  When <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>
is entered it will print out the ``target'' term being rewritten.
If you type <code>:go</code> <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> will try the rule and then exit,
telling you (a) whether the rule was applied, (b) if so, how the
target was rewritten, and (c) if not, why the rule failed.  There
are many other commands.  See <a href="BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a>.<p>

(4) When you have finished using the <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> feature you
should disable it to speed up the rewriter.  You can disable it with

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:brr nil
</pre>

The list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules and their break conditions persists
but is ignored.  If you enable <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> later, the list of
<a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules will be displayed and will be used again by rewrite.<p>

You should disable the <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> feature whenever you are not
intending to use it, even if the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules is empty,
because the rewriter is slowed down as long as <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> is
enabled.<p>
