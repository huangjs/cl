<h1>BREAK-REWRITE</h1>the read-eval-print loop entered to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> rewrite rules
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="acl2-doc-major-topics.html">ACL2 Documentation</a>
</pre><p>

ACL2 allows the user to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the application of rewrite rules.
When <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules are about to be tried by the rewriter, an
interactive break occurs and the user is allowed to watch and, in a
limited sense, control the attempt to apply the rule.  This
interactive loop, which is technically just a call of the standard
top-level ACL2 read-eval-print loop, <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>, on a ``<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>''
(see <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>), is called ``break-rewrite.''  While in
break-rewrite, certain keyword commands are available for accessing
information about the context in which the lemma is being tried.
These keywords are called break-rewrite ``commands.''<p>

To abort from inside break-rewrite at any time, execute
sharpsign-period (<code>#.</code>).<p>

As explained in the documentation for <code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code>, it is possible to
cause the ACL2 rewriter to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the attempted application of
selected rules.  When such a rule is about to be tried, the rewriter
evaluates its break condition and if the result is non-<code>nil</code>,
break-rewrite is entered.<p>

Break-rewrite permits the user to inspect the current <a href="STATE.html">state</a> by
evaluating break-rewrite commands.  Type <code>:</code><code><a href="HELP.html">help</a></code> in break-rewrite to
see what the break-rewrite commands are.  However, break-rewrite is
actually just a call of the general ACL2 read-eval-print loop, <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>,
on a certain <a href="STATE.html">state</a> and the break-rewrite commands are simply aliases
provided by the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>-special <code><a href="LD-KEYWORD-ALIASES.html">ld-keyword-aliases</a></code>.  See <a href="LD.html">ld</a> for
details about this read-eval-print loop.  Thus, with a few
exceptions, anything you can do at the ACL2 top-level can be done
within break-rewrite.  For example, you can evaluate arbitrary
expressions, use the keyword command hack, access <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>,
print <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, and even define functions and prove theorems.
However, the ``certain <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' upon which <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> was called is a
``<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' (see <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>) because break-rewrite is not
allowed to have any effect upon the behavior of rewrite.  What this
means, very roughly but understandably, is that break-rewrite
operates on a copy of the <a href="STATE.html">state</a> being used by rewrite and when
break-rewrite exits the <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> closes and the <a href="STATE.html">state</a> ``produced''
by break-rewrite disappears.  Thus, break-rewrite lets you query the
state of the rewriter and even do experiments involving proofs,
etc., but these experiments have no effect on the ongoing proof
attempt.<p>

When you first enter break-rewrite a simple herald is printed such
as:

<pre>
(3 Breaking (:rewrite lemma12) on (delta a (+ 1 j)):
</pre>

The integer after the open parenthesis indicates the depth of
nested break-rewrite calls.  In this discussion we use <code>3</code>
consistently for this integer.  Unless you abort or somehow enter
unbalanced parentheses into the script, the entire session at a
given depth will be enclosed in balanced parentheses, making it easy
to skip over them in Emacs.<p>

You then will see the break-rewrite <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>:

<pre>
3 ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>

The leading integer is, again, the depth.  Because breaks often
occur recursively it is convenient always to know the level with
which you are interacting.<p>

You may type arbitrary commands as in the top-level ACL2 loop.  For
example, you might type:

<pre>
3 ACL2 !&gt;:help
</pre>

or

<pre>
3 ACL2 !&gt;:pe lemma12
</pre>

More likely, upon entering break-rewrite you will determine the
context of the attempted application.  Here are some useful
commands:

<pre>
3 ACL2 &gt;:target           ; the term being rewritten
3 ACL2 &gt;:unify-subst      ; the unifying substitution
3 ACL2 &gt;:path             ; the stack of goals pursued by the rewriter
                          ; starting at the top-level clause being simplified
                          ; and ending with the current application
</pre>

At this point in the interaction the system has not yet tried to
apply the <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rule.  That is, it has not tried to establish
the hypotheses, considered the heuristic cost of backchaining,
rewritten the right-hand side of the conclusion, etc.  When you are
ready for it to try the rule you can type one of several different
``proceed'' commands.  The basic proceed commands are <code>:ok</code>, <code>:go</code>, and
<code>:eval</code>.

<pre>
:ok
</pre>

exits break-rewrite without further interaction.  When
break-rewrite exits it prints ``<code>3)</code>'', closing the parenthesis that
opened the level <code>3</code> interaction.

<pre>
:go
</pre>

exits break-rewrite without further interaction, but prints out
the result of the application attempt, i.e., whether the application
succeeded, if so, what the <code>:target</code> term was rewritten to, and if not
why the rule was not applicable.

<pre>
:eval
</pre>

causes break-rewrite to attempt to apply the rule but interaction
at this level of break-rewrite resumes when the attempt is complete.
When control returns to this level of break-rewrite a message
indicating the result of the application attempt (just as in <code>:go</code>) is
printed, followed by the <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a> for additional user input.<p>

Generally speaking, <code>:ok</code> and <code>:go</code> are used when the break in question
is routine or uninteresting and <code>:eval</code> is used when the break is one
that the user anticipates is causing trouble.  For example, if you
are trying to determine why a lemma isn't being applied to a given
term and the <code>:target</code> of the current break-rewrite is the term in
question, you would usually <code>:eval</code> the rule and if break-rewrite
reports that the rule failed then you are in a position to determine
why, for example by carefully inspecting the <code>:type-alist</code> of
governing assumptions or why some hypothesis of the rule could not
be established.<p>

It is often the case that when you are in break-rewrite you wish to
change the set of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s.  This can be done by using
<code>:</code><code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></code> as noted above.  For example, you might want
to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> a certain rule, say <code>hyp-reliever</code>, just when it is being
used while attempting to apply another rule, say <code>main-lemma</code>.
Typically then you would <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> <code>main-lemma</code> at the ACL2 top-level,
start the proof-attempt, and then in the break-rewrite in which
<code>main-lemma</code> is about to be tried, you would install a <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> on
<code>hyp-reliever</code>.  If during the ensuing <code>:eval</code> <code>hyp-reliever</code> is broken
you will know it is being used under the attempt to apply
<code>main-lemma</code>.<p>

However, once <code>hyp-reliever</code> is being <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed it will be <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed
even after <code>main-lemma</code> has been tried.  That is, if you let the proof
attempt proceed then you may see many other breaks on <code>hyp-reliever</code>,
breaks that are not ``under'' the attempt to apply <code>main-lemma</code>.  One
way to prevent this is to <code>:eval</code> the application of <code>main-lemma</code> and
then <code>:</code><code><a href="UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></code> <code>hyp-reliever</code> before exiting.  But this case arises
so often that ACL2 supports several additional ``flavors'' of
proceed commands.<p>

<code>:Ok!</code>, <code>:go!</code>, and <code>:eval!</code> are just like their counterparts
(<code>:ok</code>, <code>:go</code>, and <code>:eval</code>, respectively), except that while
processing the rule that is currently broken no <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s are
<a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed.  When consideration of the current rule is complete,
the set of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s is restored to its original
setting.<p>

<code>:Ok$</code>, <code>:go$</code>, and <code>:eval$</code> are similar but take an additional argument
which must be a list of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s.  An example usage of <code>:eval$</code> is

<pre>
3 ACL2 !&gt;:eval$ ((:rewrite hyp-reliever))
</pre>

These three commands temporarily install unconditional breaks on
the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s listed, proceed with the consideration of the currently
broken rule, and then restore the set of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules to its
original setting.<p>

Thus, there are nine ways to proceed from the initial entry into
break-rewrite although we often speak as though there are two, <code>:ok</code>
and <code>:eval</code>, and leave the others implicit.  We group <code>:go</code> with <code>:ok</code>
because in all their flavors they exit break-rewrite without further
interaction (at the current level).  All the flavors of <code>:eval</code>
require further interaction after the rule has been tried.<p>

To abort a proof attempt and return to the top-level of ACL2 you may
at any time type <code>#.</code> (that is, number-sign followed by a period)
followed by a carriage return.<p>

We now address ourselves to the post-<code>:eval</code> interaction with
break-rewrite.  As noted, that interaction begins with
break-rewrite's report on the results of applying the rule: whether
it worked and either what it produced or why it failed.  This
information is also printed by certain keyword commands available
after <code>:eval</code>, namely <code>:wonp</code>, <code>:rewritten-rhs</code>, and <code>:failure-reason</code>.  In
addition, by using <code><a href="BRR_at_.html">brr@</a></code> (see <a href="BRR_at_.html">brr@</a>) you can obtain this
information in the form of ACL2 data objects.  This allows the
development of more sophisticated ``break conditions'';
see <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> for examples.  In this connection we point out the
macro form <code>(ok-if term)</code>.  See <a href="OK-IF.html">ok-if</a>.  This command exits
break-rewrite if <code>term</code> evaluates to non-<code>nil</code> and otherwise does not
exit.  Thus it is possible to define macros that provide other kinds
of exits from break-rewrite.  The only way to exit break-rewrite
after <code>:eval</code> is <code>:ok</code> (or, equivalently, the use of <code><a href="OK-IF.html">ok-if</a></code>).<p>

ACL2 users who wish to know more about break-rewrite so that they
can develop more convenient ways to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> rules are encouraged to
speak to J Moore.<p>

The rest of this <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> discusses a few implementation
details of break-rewrite and may not be interesting to the typical
user.<p>

There is no ACL2 function named break-rewrite.  It is an illusion
created by appropriate calls to two functions named <code>brkpt1</code> and
<code>brkpt2</code>.  As previously noted, break-rewrite is <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> operating on a
<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.  One might therefore wonder how break-rewrite can
apply a rule and then communicate the results back to the rewriter
running in the external <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.  The answer is that it cannot.
Nothing can be communicated through a <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>.  In fact, <code>brkpt1</code> and
<code>brkpt2</code> are each calls of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> running on <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>s.  <code>Brkpt1</code>
implements the pre-<code>:eval</code> break-rewrite and <code>brkpt2</code> implements the
post-<code>:eval</code> break-rewrite.  The rewriter actually calls <code>brkpt1</code> before
attempting to apply a rule and calls <code>brkpt2</code> afterwards.  In both
cases, the rewriter passes into the <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> the relevant
information about the current context.  Logically <code>brkpt1</code> and <code>brkpt2</code>
are no-ops and <code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> ignores the <code>nil</code> they return.  But while
control is in them the execution of <code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> is suspended and cannot
proceed until the break-rewrite interactions complete.<p>

This design causes a certain anomoly that might be troubling.
Suppose that inside break-rewrite before <code>:evaling</code> a rule (i.e., in
the <code>brkpt1</code> <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>) you define some function, <code>foo</code>.  Suppose
then you <code>:eval</code> the rule and eventually control returns to
break-rewrite (i.e., to <code>brkpt2</code> on a <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a> with the results
of the application in it).  You will discover that <code>foo</code> is no longer
defined!  That is because the <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a> created during your
<code>pre-:eval</code> interaction is lost when we exit the <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> to resume
the proof attempt.  The post-<code>:eval</code> <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a> is in fact
identical to the initial pre-<code>:eval</code> <a href="STATE.html">state</a> (except for the results of
the application) because <code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> did not change the external <a href="STATE.html">state</a>
and both <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>s are copies of it.<p>

There is a lot more to know about break-rewrite, most of which is
fairly easy to learn from looking at the code, since it is all
expressed in ACL2.  Feel free to ask questions of J Moore.
