<p>
<a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">Break-rewrite</a> is just a call of the standard ACL2 read-eval-print
loop, <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>, on a ``<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>'' <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.  Thus, you may execute most
commands you might normally execute at the top-level of ACL2.
However, all <a href="STATE.html">state</a> changes you cause from within <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> are
lost when you exit or <code>:eval</code> the rule.  You cannot modify <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s from
within the break.  See <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for
more details and see <a href="LD.html">ld</a> for general information about the
standard ACL2 read-eval-print loop.
