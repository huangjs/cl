<h2>CBD</h2>connected book directory string

The connected book directory is a nonempty string that specifies a
directory as an absolute pathname.  (See <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a> for a
discussion of file naming conventions.)  When <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is given
a relative book name it elaborates it into a full book name,
essentially by appending the connected book directory string to the
left and <code>".lisp"</code> to the right.  (For details,
see <a href="BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a> and also see <a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>.)  Furthermore,
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> temporarily sets the connected book directory to the
directory string of the resulting full book name so that references
to inferior <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> in the same directory may omit the directory.
See <a href="SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a> for how to set the connected book directory string.

General Form:
(cbd)

This is a macro that expands into a term involving the single free
variable <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  It returns the connected book directory string.<p>

The connected book directory (henceforth called the ``<code>cbd</code>'') is
used by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> to elaborate the supplied book name into a
full book name (see <a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>).  For example, if the <code>cbd</code>
is <code>"/usr/home/smith/"</code> then the elaboration of the <a href="BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>
<code>"project/task-1/arith"</code> (to the <code>".lisp"</code> extension) is
<code>"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp"</code>.  That
<a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> is what <a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> opens to read the
source text for the book.<p>

The <code>cbd</code> may be changed using <code><a href="SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a></code> (see <a href="SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a>).
Furthermore, during the processing of the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in a book,
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> sets the <code>cbd</code> to be the directory string of the
<a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> of the book.  Thus, if the <code>cbd</code> is
<code>"/usr/home/smith/"</code> then during the processing of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> by

<pre>
(include-book "project/task-1/arith")
</pre>

the <code>cbd</code> will be set to <code>"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/"</code>.
Note that if <code>"arith"</code> recursively includes a subbook, say
<code>"naturals"</code>, that resides on the same directory, the
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event for it may omit the specification of that
directory.  For example, <code>"arith"</code> might contain the event

<pre>
  (include-book "naturals").
</pre>

In general, suppose we have a superior book and several inferior
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> which are included by <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in the superior book.  Any
inferior book residing on the same directory as the superior book
may be referenced in the superior without specification of the
directory.<p>

We call this a ``relative'' as opposed to ``absolute'' naming.  The
use of relative naming is preferred because it permits <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>
(and their accompanying inferiors) to be moved between directories
while maintaining their <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s and utility.  Certified
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> that reference inferiors by absolute file names are unusable
(and rendered uncertified) if the inferiors are moved to new
directories.<p>

<em>Technical Note and a Challenge to Users:</em><p>

After elaborating the book name to a full book name, <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>
opens a channel to the file to process the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in it.  In some
host Common Lisps, the actual file opened depends upon a notion of
``connected directory'' similar to our connected book directory.
Our intention in always elaborating book names into absolute
filename strings (see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a> for terminology) is to
circumvent the sensitivity to the connected directory.  But we may
have insufficient control over this since the ultimate file naming
conventions are determined by the host operating system rather than
Common Lisp (though, we do check that the operating system
``appears'' to be one that we ``know'' about).  Here is a question,
which we'll pose assuming that we have an operating system that
calls itself ``Unix.''  Suppose we have a file name, filename, that
begins with a slash, e.g., <code>"/usr/home/smith/..."</code>.  Consider two
successive invocations of CLTL's

<pre>
(open filename :direction :input)
</pre>

separated only by a change to the operating system's notion of
connected directory.  Must these two invocations produce streams to
the same file?  A candidate string might be something like
<code>"/usr/home/smith/*/usr/local/src/foo.lisp"</code> which includes some
operating system-specific special character to mean ``here insert
the connected directory'' or, more generally, ``here make the name
dependent on some non-ACL2 aspect of the host's state.''  If such
``tricky'' name strings beginning with a slash exist, then we have
failed to isolate ACL2 adequately from the operating system's file
naming conventions.  Once upon a time, ACL2 did not insist that the
<code>cbd</code> begin with a slash and that allowed the string
<code>"foo.lisp"</code> to be tricky because if one were connected to
<code>"/usr/home/smith/"</code> then with the empty <code>cbd</code> <code>"foo.lisp"</code>
is a full book name that names the same file as
<code>"/usr/home/smith/foo.lisp"</code>.  If the actual file one reads is
determined by the operating system's state then it is possible for
ACL2 to have two distinct ``full book names'' for the same file, the
``real'' name and the ``tricky'' name.  This can cause ACL2 to
include the same book twice, not recognizing the second one as
redundant.
