<h2>CERTIFICATE</h2>how a book is known to be admissible and where its <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s reside
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BOOKS.html">BOOKS</a>
</pre><p>

A book, say <code>"arith"</code>, is said to have a ``certificate'' if there
is a file named <code>"arith.cert"</code>.  Certificates are created by the
function <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> and inspected by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  Check
sums are used to help ensure that certificates are legitimate and
that the corresponding book has not been modified since
certification.  But because the file system is insecure and check
sums are not perfect it is possible for the inclusion of a book to
cause inconsistency even though the book carries an impeccable
certificate.<p>

The certificate includes the version number of the certifying ACL2.
A book is considered uncertified if it is included in an ACL2
with a different <a href="VERSION.html">version</a> number.
<p>
The presence of a ``valid'' certificate file for a book attests to
two things: all of the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> of the book are admissible in a
certain extension of the initial ACL2 logic, and the non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> of the book are independent of the <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> ones
(see <a href="LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a>).  In addition, the certificate
contains the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s used to construct the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> in which
certification occurred.  Among those <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s, of course, are the
<code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s defining the packages used in the book.  When a book is
included into a host <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, that <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> is first extended
by the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s listed in the certificate for the book.  Unless that
causes an error due to name conflicts, the extension ensures that
all the packages used by the book are identically defined in the
host <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.<p>

<em>Security:</em><p>

Because the host file system is insecure, there is no way ACL2 can
guarantee that the contents of a book remain the same as when its
certificate was written.  That is, between the time a book is
certified and the time it is used, it may be modified.  Furthermore,
certificates can be counterfeited.  Check sums (see <a href="CHECK-SUM.html">check-sum</a>)
are used to help detect such problems.  But check sums provide
imperfect security: two different files can have the same check sum.<p>

Therefore, from the strictly logical point of view, one must
consider even the inclusion of certified <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> as placing a burden
on the user:
<blockquote><p>

The non-erroneous inclusion of a certified book is consistency
preserving provided (a) the objects read by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> from the
certificate were the objects written there by a <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> and
(b) the forms read by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> from the book itself are the
forms read by the corresponding <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>.<p>

</blockquote>
We say that a given execution of <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is ``certified''
if a certificate file for the book is present and well-formed and
the check sum information contained within it supports the
conclusion that the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> read by the <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> are the ones
checked by <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>.  When an uncertified <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>
occurs, warnings are printed or errors are caused.  But even if no
warning is printed, you must accept burdens (a) and (b) if you use
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  These burdens are easier to live with if you protect your
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> so that other users cannot write to them, you abstain from
running concurrent ACL2 jobs, and you abstain from counterfeiting
certificates.  But even on a single user uniprocessor, you can shoot
yourself in the foot by using the ACL2 <a href="IO.html">io</a> primitives to fabricate an
inconsistent book and the corresponding certificate.<p>

Note that part (a) of the burden described above implies, in
particular, that there are no guarantees when a certificate is
copied.  When <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> are renamed (as by copying them), it is
recommended that their certificates be removed and the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> be
recertified.  The expectation is that recertification will go
through without a hitch if relative <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>s are used.
See <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>, which is not on the guided tour.<p>

Certificates essentially contain two parts, a <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> and a
<a href="KEEP.html">keep</a>.  There is a third part, an <code>expansion-alist</code>, in order
to record expansions if <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code> has been used, but the user
need not be concerned with that level of detail.<p>

See <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> to continue the guided tour through <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.
