<h2>CERTIFY-BOOK</h2>how to produce a <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for a book
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BOOKS.html">BOOKS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
(certify-book "my-arith" 3)      ;certify in a world with 3 commands
(certify-book "my-arith")        ;certify in a world with 0 commands
(certify-book "my-arith" 0 nil)  ;as above, but do not compile
(certify-book "my-arith" 0 t)    ;as above, but compile
(certify-book "my-arith" 0 :all) ;as above, but compile exececutable
                                   ;  counterparts too
(certify-book "my-arith" t)      ;certify from world of old certificate
<p>
General Form:
(certify-book book-name k compile-flg
              :defaxioms-okp t/nil        ; [default nil]
              :skip-proofs-okp t/nil      ; [default nil]
              :save-expansion :save/t/nil ; [default nil]
              :ttags ttags                ; [default nil]
              )
</pre>

where <code>book-name</code> is a book name (see <a href="BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>), <code>k</code> is
either <code>t</code> or an integer used to indicate your approval of the
``certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.''  <code>Compile-flg</code> indicates whether you
wish to compile the (functions in the) book.  <code>Compile-flg</code>
defaults to <code>t</code>, meaning to compile; <code>nil</code> means do not compile.<p>

The second argument <code>k</code> is optional as well; it defaults to <code>0</code>.<p>

Two keyword arguments, <code>:defaxioms-okp</code> and <code>:skip-proofs-okp</code>, determine
how the system handles the inclusion of <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> events and
<code><a href="SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></code> events, respectively, in the book.  The value <code>t</code> allows
such events, but prints a warning message.  The value <code>nil</code> is the default,
and causes an error if such an event is found.<p>

The keyword argument <code>:ttags</code> may normally be omitted.  A few constructs,
used for example if you are building your own system based on ACL2, may
require it.  See <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> for an explanation of this argument.<p>

To advanced users only: in the rare case that you are willing to add to
compilation time in return for compiling the executable counterparts of
functions defined in the book, you may supply a value of <code>:all</code> for
<code>compile-flg</code>.  This setting is useful for compiling a book whose functions
are called during macroexpansion, because evaluation during macroexpansion is
done in a ``safe mode'' that avoids calling raw Lisp functions
(see <a href="GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>).<p>

The keyword argument <code>:save-expansion</code> controls whether or not a so-called
``book expansion'' file is written, obtained by appending the string
"@expansion.lsp" to the end of the book name.  See <a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> for
discussion of the book expansion; in a nutshell, <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code> calls
generate forms that replace them in the book expansion.  Book expansion is
skipped if <code>compile-flg</code> and <code>:save-expansion</code> are both <code>nil</code>.
Otherwise, the values of <code>nil</code> and <code>t</code> for <code>:save-expansion</code> cause the
book expansion to be created only when a <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code> form occurs in a
book (i.e., only if there is some expansion), or if at least one executable
counterpart is to be compiled (see preceding paragraph).  If the book
expansion is created, then it is deleted after compilation if
<code>:save-expansion</code> is <code>nil</code>.  Finally, if <code>:save-expansion</code> is
<code>:save</code>, then the book expansion file is created in all cases, and is not
deleted.<p>

For a general discussion of books, see <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  <code>Certify-book</code>
is akin to what we have historically called a ``proveall'': all the
forms in the book are ``proved'' to guarantee their admissibility.
More precisely, <code>certify-book</code> (1) reads the forms in the book,
confirming that the appropriate packages are defined in the
certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>; (2) does the full admissibility checks on
each form (proving termination of recursive functions, proving
theorems, etc.), checking as it goes that each form is an embedded
event form (see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>); (3) rolls the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>
back to the initial certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> and does an
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> of the book to check for <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> incompatibilities
(see <a href="LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a>); (4) writes a <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>
recording not only that the book was certified but also recording
the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s necessary to recreate the certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> (so
the appropriate packages can be defined when the book is included in
other <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s) and the check sums of all the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> involved
(see <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>); (5) compiles the book if so directed (and
then loads the object file in that case).  The result of executing a
<code>certify-book</code> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> is the creation of a single new event, which
is actually an <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event.  If you don't want its
included <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in your present <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, simply execute <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT.html">ubt</a></code>
<code>:here</code> afterwards.<p>

<code>Certify-book</code> requires that the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>
(see <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>) be <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> when certification is
attempted.  If the mode is not <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>, an error is signalled.<p>

An error will occur if <code>certify-book</code> has to deal with any
uncertified book other than the one on which it was called.  For
example, if the book being certified includes another book, that
subbook must already have been certified.<p>

Certification occurs in some logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, called the
``certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.'' That <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> must contain the <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s
needed to read and execute the forms in the book.  The <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s
necessary to recreate that <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> from the ACL2 initial
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> will be copied into the <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> created for the
book.  Those <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s will be re-executed whenever the book is
included, to ensure that the appropriate packages (and all other
names used in the certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>) are correctly defined.  The
certified book will be more often usable if the certification
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> is kept to a minimal extension of the ACL2 initial
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Thus, before you call <code>certify-book</code> for the first
time on a book, you should get into the initial ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>
(e.g., with <code>:ubt 1</code> or just starting a new version of ACL2),
<code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> the desired packages, and then invoke <code>certify-book</code>.<p>

The <code>k</code> argument to <code>certify-book</code> must be either a nonnegative integer
or else one of the symbols <code>t</code> or <code>?</code> in the <code>ACL2</code> package.  If <code>k</code>
is an integer, then it must be the number of <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s that have been
executed after the initial ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> to create the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> in which
<code>certify-book</code> was called.  One way to obtain this number is by doing
<code>:pbt :start</code> to see all the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s back to the first one.<p>

If <code>k</code> is <code>t</code> it means that <code>certify-book</code> should use the same
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> used in the last certification of this book.  <code>K</code> may be <code>t</code>
only if you call <code>certify-book</code> in the initial ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> and there is
a <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> on file for the book being certified.  (Of course, the
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> is probably invalid.)  In this case, <code>certify-book</code> reads
the old <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> to obtain the <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s and
executes them to recreate the certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.<p>

Finally, <code>k</code> may be <code>?</code>, in which case there is no check made on the
certification world.  That is, if <code>k</code> is <code>?</code> then no action related to
the preceding two paragraphs is performed, which can be a nice convenience
but at the cost of eliminating a potentially valuable check that the
certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> may be as expected.<p>

If you have a certified book that has remained unchanged for some
time you are unlikely even to remember the appropriate <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s
for it.  If you begin to change the book, don't throw away its
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file just because it has become invalid!  It is an
important historical document until the book is re-certified.<p>

When <code>certify-book</code> is directed to produce a compiled file, it
calls the Common Lisp function <code>compile-file</code> on the original source
file.  This creates a compiled file with an extension known to ACL2,
e.g., if the book is named <code>"my-book"</code> then the source file is
<code>"my-book.lisp"</code> and the compiled file under AKCL will be
<code>"my-book.o"</code> while under Lucid it will be <code>"my-book.lbin"</code> or
<code>"my-book.sbin".</code>  The compiled file is then loaded.  When
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is used later on <code>"my-book"</code> it will
automatically load the compiled file, provided the compiled file has
a later write date than the source file.  The only effect of such
<a href="COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> and loading is that the functions defined in the
book execute faster.  See <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> for a discussion of the issues.<p>

When <code>certify-book</code> is directed not to produce a compiled file, it
will delete any existing compiled file for the book, so as not to
mislead <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> into loading the now outdated compiled file.<p>

After execution of a <code>certify-book</code> form, the value of
<code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> is restored to what it was immediately before
that <code>certify-book</code> form was executed.
See <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.<p>
