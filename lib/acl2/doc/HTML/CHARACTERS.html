<h2>CHARACTERS</h2>characters in ACL2
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">PROGRAMMING</a>
</pre><p>

ACL2 accepts 256 distinct characters, which are the characters
obtained by applying the function <code><a href="CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a></code> to each integer from <code>0</code>
to <code>255</code>.  Among these, Common Lisp designates certain ones as
<em>standard characters</em>, namely those of the form <code>(code-char n)</code>
where <code>n</code> is from <code>33</code> to <code>126</code>, together with <code>#\Newline</code> and <code>#\Space</code>.  The
actual standard characters may be viewed by evaluating the
<code><a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></code> <code>*standard-chars*</code>.
<p>
To be more precise, Common Lisp does not specify the precise
relationship between <code><a href="CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a></code> and the standard characters.
However, we check that the underlying Common Lisp implementation
uses a particular relationship that extends the usual ASCII coding
of characters.  We also check that Space, Tab, Newline, Page, and
Rubout correspond to characters with respective <code><a href="CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></code>s <tt>32</tt>, <tt>9</tt>,
<tt>10</tt>, <tt>12</tt>, and <tt>127</tt>.<p>

<code><a href="CODE-CHAR.html">Code-char</a></code> has an inverse, <code><a href="CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></code>.  Thus, when <code><a href="CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></code> is
applied to an ACL2 character, <code>c</code>, it returns a number <code>n</code> between <code>0</code> and
<code>255</code> inclusive such that <code>(code-char n)</code> = <code>c</code>.<p>

The preceding paragraph implies that there is only one ACL2
character with a given character code.  CLTL allows for
``attributes'' for characters, which could allow distinct characters
with the same code, but ACL2 does not allow this.<p>

<em>The Character Reader</em><p>

ACL2 supports the `<code>#\</code>' notation for characters provided by Common
Lisp, with some restrictions.  First of all, for every character <code>c</code>,
the notation

<pre>
#\c
</pre>

may be used to denote the character object <code>c</code>.  That is, the user may
type in this notation and ACL2 will read it as denoting the
character object <code>c</code>.  In this case, the character immediately
following <code>c</code> must be one of the following ``terminating characters'':
a Tab, a Newline, a Page character, a space, or one of the
characters:

<pre>
"  '  (  )  ;  `  ,
</pre>

Other than the notation above, ACL2 accepts alternate notation for
five characters.

<pre>
#\Space
#\Tab
#\Newline
#\Page
#\Rubout
</pre>
<p>

Again, in each of these cases the next character must be from among
the set of ``terminating characters'' described in the
single-character case.  Our implementation is consistent with
IS0-8859, even though we don't provide <code>#\</code> syntax for entering
characters other than that described above.<p>

Finally, we note that it is our intention that any object printed by
ACL2's top-level-loop may be read back into ACL2.  Please notify the
implementors if you find a counterexample to this claim.
