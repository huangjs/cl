<h2>CHECKPOINT-FORCED-GOALS</h2>Cause forcing goals to be checkpointed in proof trees
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">PROOF-TREE</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example forms:
(checkpoint-forced-goals t)
(checkpoint-forced-goals nil)
</pre>

Also see <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.
<p>
By default, goals are not marked as checkpoints by a proof tree
display (as described elsewhere; see <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>)
merely because they <a href="FORCE.html">force</a> some hypotheses, thus possibly
contributing to a forcing round.  However, some users may want such
behavior, which will occur once the command <code>(checkpoint-forced-goals</code>
<code>t</code>) has been executed.  To return to the default behavior, use the
command <code>(checkpoint-forced-goals nil)</code>.
