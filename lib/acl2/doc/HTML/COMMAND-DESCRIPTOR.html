<h2>COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR</h2>an object describing a particular <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> typed by the user
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:<p>

:max      ; the command most recently typed by the user
:x        ; synonymous with :max
(:x -1)   ; the command before the most recent one
(:x -2)   ; the command before that
:x-2      ; synonymous with (:x -2)
5         ; the fifth command typed by the user
1         ; the first command typed by the user
0         ; the last command of the system initialization
-1        ; the next-to-last initialization command
:min      ; the first command of the initialization
:start    ; the last command of the initial ACL2 logical world
fn        ; the command that introduced the logical name fn
(:search (defmacro foo-bar))
          ; the first command encountered in a search from :max to
          ; 0 that either contains defmacro and foo-bar in the 
          ; command form or contains defmacro and foo-bar in some 
          ; event within its block.

<p>
The recorded <a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> of your interactions with the top-level ACL2
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop is marked by the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s you typed that changed the
logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Each such <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> generated one or more <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>,
since the only way for you to change the logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> is to execute
an event function.  See <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> and see <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  We divide
<a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> into ``<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> blocks,'' grouping together each <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>
changing <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> and its <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  A ``<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor'' is an
object that can be used to describe a particular <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> in the
<a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> of the ongoing session.<p>

Each <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> is assigned a unique integer called its ``<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>
number'' which indicates the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>'s position in the chronological
ordering of all of the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s ever executed in this session
(including those executed to initialize the system).  We assign the
number 1 to the first <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> you type to ACL2.  We assign 2 to the
second and so on.  The non-positive integers are assigned to
``prehistoric'' <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s, i.e., the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s used to initialize the
ACL2 system: 0 is the last <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> of the initialization, -1 is the
one before that, etc.<p>

The legal <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors are described below.  We use <code>n</code> to
denote any integer, <code>sym</code> to denote any logical name
(see <a href="LOGICAL-NAME.html">logical-name</a>), and <code>cd</code> to denote, recursively, any <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>
descriptor.

 command                   command
descriptor                described<p>

:max   -- the most recently executed command (i.e., the one with
          the largest command number)
:x     -- synonymous with :max
:x-k   -- synonymous with (:x -k), if k is an integer and k&gt;0
:min   -- the earliest command (i.e., the one with the smallest
          command number and hence the first command of the system
          initialization)
:start -- the last command when ACL2 starts up
n      -- command number n  (If n is not in the
          range :min&lt;=n&lt;=:max, n is replaced by the nearest of :min
          and :max.)
sym    -- the command that introduced the logical name sym
(cd n) -- the command whose number is n plus the command number of
          the command described by cd
(:search pat cd1 cd2)
          In this command descriptor, pat must be either an atom or
          a true list of atoms and cd1 and cd2 must be command
          descriptors.  We search the interval from cd1 through cd2
          for the first command that matches pat.  Note that if cd1
          occurs chronologically after cd2, the search is
          ``backwards'' through history while if cd1 occurs
          chronologically before cd2, the search is ``forwards''.  A
          backwards search will find the most recent match; a
          forward search will find the chronologically earliest
          match.  A command matches pat if either the command form
          itself or one of the events in the block contains pat (or
          all of the atoms in pat if pat is a list).
(:search pat)
          the command found by (:search pat :max 0), i.e., the most
          recent command matching pat that was part of the user's
          session, not part of the system initialization.
