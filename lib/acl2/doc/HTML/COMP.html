<h2>COMP</h2>compile some ACL2 functions
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
:comp t          ; compile all uncompiled ACL2 functions
(comp t)         ; same as above, but can be put into a book
(comp :exec)     ; compile all uncompiled logic (``*1*'') definitions
:comp foo        ; compile the defined function foo
:comp (:raw foo) ; compile the raw Lisp version of the defined function foo
                   but not the corresponding logic definition
:comp (foo bar)  ; compile the defined functions foo and bar
:comp (foo (:raw bar))  ; compile the defined functions foo and bar, but for
                        ; bar do not compile the corresponding logic definition<p>

General Form:
:comp specifier
where specifier is one of the following:<p>

  t                     compile all user-defined ACL2 functions that are
                          currently uncompiled (redefined built-in functions
                          are not recompiled)
  :exec                 same as t, except that only logic versions are
                          compiled (see below), not raw Lisp definitions
  :raw                  same as t, except that only raw Lisp definitions are
                          compiled, not logic version (see below)
  (name-1 ... name-k)   a non-empty list of names of functions defined by
                          DEFUN in ACL2, except that each name-i can be of
                          the form (:raw sym) or (:exec sym), where sym is
                        the name of such a function
  name                  same as (name)
</pre>
<p>

When you define a function in ACL2, you are really causing two definitions to
be made ``under the hood'' in Common Lisp: the definition is submitted
explicitly to raw Lisp, but so is a corresponding ``logic definition''.  If
guards have not been verified, then only the logic definition will be
evaluated; see <a href="GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>, in particular the section titled
``Guards and evaluation V: efficiency issues''.<p>

Thus, if you are not verifying <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s and you want the benefit of Lisp
compilation for speed and space efficiency, then you may want to place the
form <code>(comp :exec)</code> in your <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.<p>

Generally it is not necessary to place the form <code>(comp t)</code>, or the form
<code>(comp :raw)</code>, in a book, because <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> compiles the raw Lisp
definitions anyhow, by default.  But you may wish to put <code>(comp t)</code> or
<code>(comp fn1 fn2 ... fnk)</code> in a book when such a form precedes expensive
calls of functions, for example for proofs involving calls of functions on
large constants, or to support computationally expensive macroexpansion.<p>

As suggested by the examples above, if a function specifier is of the form
<code>(:raw fn)</code>, then <code>fn</code> will be compiled in raw Common Lisp but its
corresponding logic definition will not be compiled; and for <code>(:exec fn)</code>,
it's the other way around.<p>

The use of <code>:comp</code> creates various files whose names start with
``<code>TMP*</code>'', but then deletes them.  If you want to keep these files around
for some reason, evaluate <code>(assign keep-tmp-files t)</code>.

Also see <a href="SET-COMPILE-FNS.html">set-compile-fns</a> for a way to compile each function as it is
defined.  But note that <code>set-compile-fns</code> is ignored during
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.<p>
