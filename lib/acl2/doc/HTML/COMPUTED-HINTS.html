<pre>
General Form of :hints:
(hint1 hint2 ... hintk)
</pre>

Each element, hinti, must be either a common hint or a computed
hint.
<p>
A common hint is of the form

<pre>
(goal-spec :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)
</pre>
<p>

where <code>goal-spec</code> is as specified in <a href="GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a> and each
<code>:keyi</code> and <code>vali</code> is as specified in <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

A computed hint is either a function symbol, <code>fn</code>, of three, four
or seven arguments or is any term whose only free variables are among
<code>ID</code>, <code>CLAUSE</code>, <code>WORLD</code>, <code>STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP</code>,
<code>HIST</code>, <code>PSPV</code>, and <code>CTX</code>.
The function symbol case is treated as an abbreviation of the term
<code>(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD)</code>,
<code>(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP)</code>, or
<code>(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP HIST PSPV CTX)</code>
as appropriate for the arity of <code>fn</code>.  (Note that
this tells you which argument of <code>fn</code> is which.)  In the discussion 
below we assume all computed hints are of the term form.  Indeed, we
almost assume all computed hints are of the 3 and 4 argument forms.
We only comment briefly on the 7 argument form in
<a href="USING-COMPUTED-HINTS-8.html">using-computed-hints-8</a>.<p>

The evaluation of the term (in a context in which its variables are
bound as described below) should be either <code>nil</code>, indicating that
the hint is not applicable to the clause in question, or else the
value is an alternating list of <code>:keyi</code> <code>vali</code> ``pairs.''
Except possibly for the first keyword, the <code>:keyi</code> <code>vali</code> pairs
should be as specified in <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.  That is, those elements of the
result should be hint settings as you might have typed in a common
hint.  The first keyword is allowed to be <code>:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</code>.
Its value should be <code>nil</code>, <code>t</code>, or a list of terms.  If this
keyword is not present, the default value of <code>nil</code> is provided.<p>

The evaluation of a hint term is done with guard checking turned off
(see <a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>); e.g., the form <code>(car 23)</code> in a
computed hint returns <code>nil</code> as per the axioms.<p>

When a non-<code>nil</code> value is returned, the keyword/value pairs (other
than the optional <code>:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</code>) are used as the
hint for the subgoal in question.  Thus, your job as the programmer
of computed hints is to generate the list of keys and values you
would have typed had you supplied a common hint for the subgoal. (In
particular, any theory expressions in it are evaluated with respect
to the global current-theory, not whatever theory is active at the
subgoal in question.)  If the generated list of keywords and values
is illegal, an error will be signaled and the proof attempt will be
aborted.<p>

The purpose of the <code>:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</code> keyword and its
value, <code>chr</code>, is to change the list of hints.  If <code>chr</code> is <code>nil</code>,
then the hint which was applied is removed from the list of hints that
is passed down to the children of the subgoal in question.  This is
the default.  If <code>chr</code> is <code>t</code>, then the hint is left in list of
hints.  This means that the same hint may act on the children of the
subgoal.  Otherwise, <code>chr</code> must be a list of terms, each of which
is treated as a computed hint.  The hint which was applied is deleted
from the list of hints and the hints in <code>chr</code> are added to the list
of hints passed to the children of the subgoal.  The ability to compute
new hints and pass them down allows strange and wonderful behavior.<p>

For these purposes, the goals produced by induction and the top-level
goals of forcing rounds are not considered children; all original hints
are available to them.<p>

After a computed hint is applied to a goal and before the goal is
processed, the remaining applicable computed hints are applied.
For hint settings, such as <code>:USE</code>, that modify the goal, the effect
of more than one applicable hint just compounds.  But for hint settings,
such as <code>:IN-THEORY</code> that determine the context of the subsequent
goal processing, only the last applicable hint is effective.<p>

It remains only to describe the bindings of the four variables.<p>

Suppose the theorem prover is working on some clause, clause, named
by some <code><a href="GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a></code>, e.g., "Subgoal *1/2'''" in some logical
world, world.  Corresponding to the printed <code>goal-spec</code> is an
internal data structure called a ``clause identifier'' id.
See <a href="CLAUSE-IDENTIFIER.html">clause-identifier</a>.<p>

In the case of a common hint, the hint applies if the goal-spec of
the hint is the same as the goal-spec of the clause in question.<p>

In the case of a computed hint, the variable <code>ID</code> is bound to the
clause id, the variable <code>CLAUSE</code> is bound to the (translated form
of the) clause, and the variable <code>WORLD</code> is bound to the current
ACL2 world.  The variable <code>STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP</code> is bound
to <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.  It is bound to <code>t</code> only if the clause 
is known to be stable under simplification.  That is, the simplifier
has been applied to the clause and did not change it.  Such a clause
is sometimes known as a ``simplification checkpoint.''  It is
frequently useful to inject hints (e.g., to enable a rule or provide
a <code>:use</code> hint) only when the goal in question has stabilized.  If
a hint is provided, the processing of the clause starts over with
simplification.<p>
