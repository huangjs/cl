<h2>CONSTRAINT</h2>restrictions on certain functions introduced in <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

Suppose that a given theorem, <code>thm</code>, is to be functionally instantiated
using a given functional substitution, <code>alist</code>.  (See <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>, or
for an example, see <a href="FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION-EXAMPLE.html">functional-instantiation-example</a>.)  What is the set of
proof obligations generated?  It is the set obtained by applying <code>alist</code> to
all terms, <code>tm</code>, such that (a) <code>tm</code> mentions some function symbol in the
domain of <code>alist</code>, and (b) either (i) <code>tm</code> arises from the ``constraint''
on a function symbol ancestral in <code>thm</code> or in some <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> or (ii)
<code>tm</code> is the body of a <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code>.  Here, a function symbol is
``ancestral'' in <code>thm</code> if either it occurs in <code>thm</code>, or it occurs in the
definition of some function symbol that occurs in <code>thm</code>, and so on.<p>

The remainder of this note explains what we mean by ``constraint''
in the words above.
<p>
In a certain sense, function symbols are introduced in essentially
two ways.  The most common way is to use <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> (or when there is
mutual recursion, <code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> or <code><a href="DEFUNS.html">defuns</a></code>).  There is also
a mechanism for introducing ``witness functions'';
see <a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.  The documentation for these <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> describes
the axioms they introduce, which we will call here their
``definitional axioms.''  These definitional axioms are generally
the constraints on the function symbols that these axioms introduce.<p>

However, when a function symbol is introduced in the scope of an
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event, its constraints may differ from the
definitional axioms introduced for it.  For example, suppose that a
function's definition is <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> to the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>; that is,
suppose the function is introduced in the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of the
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>.  Then its constraints include, at the least, those
non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> theorems and definitions in the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> that
mention the function symbol.<p>

Actually, it will follow from the discussion below that if the
<a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> is empty for an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, then the constraint on
each of its new function symbols is exactly the definitional axiom
introduced for it.  Intuitively, we view such <code>encapsulates</code> just
as we view <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  But the general case, where the
<a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> is not empty, is more complicated.<p>

In the discussion that follows we describe in detail exactly which
constraints are associated with which function symbols that are
introduced in the scope of an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event.  In order to
simplify the exposition we make two cuts at it.  In the first cut we
present an over-simplified explanation that nevertheless captures
the main ideas.  In the second cut we complete our explanation by
explaining how we view certain <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> as being ``lifted'' out of the
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, resulting in a possibly smaller <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>,
which becomes the target of the algorithm described in the first
cut.<p>

At the end of this note we present an example showing why a more
naive approach is unsound.<p>

Finally, before we start our ``first cut,'' we note that constrained
functions always have <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of T.  This makes sense when one
considers that a constrained function's ``<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>'' only appears in
the context of a <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>, which is skipped.  Note also that any
information you want ``exported'' outside an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event must
be there as an explicit definition or theorem.  For example, even if
a function <code>foo</code> has output type <code>(mv t t)</code> in its <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>, the system
will not know <code>(true-listp (foo x))</code> merely on account of this
information.  Thus, if you are using functions like <code>foo</code>
(constrained <code><a href="MV.html">mv</a></code> functions) in a context where you are verifying
<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s, then you should probably provide a <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rule
for the constrained function, for example, the <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code>
rule <code>(true-listp (foo x))</code>.<p>

<em>First cut at constraint-assigning algorithm.</em>  Quite simply, the
formulas introduced in the scope of an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> are conjoined,
and each function symbol introduced by the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> is
assigned that conjunction as its constraint.<p>

Clearly this is a rather severe algorithm.  Let us consider two
possible optimizations in an informal manner before presenting our
second cut.<p>

Consider the (rather artificial) event below.  The function
<code>before1</code> does not refer at all, even indirectly, to the
locally-introduced function <code>sig-fn</code>, so it is unfortunate to
saddle it with constraints about <code>sig-fn</code>.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))<p>

 (defun before1 (x)
   (if (consp x)
       (before1 (cdr x))
     x))<p>

 (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))<p>

 (defthm sig-fn-prop
   (consp (sig-fn x)))
 )
</pre>

We would like to imagine moving the definition of <code>before1</code> to just
in front of this <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, as follows.

<pre>
(defun before1 (x)
  (if (consp x)
      (before1 (cdr x))
    x))<p>

(encapsulate
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))<p>

 (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))<p>

 (defthm sig-fn-prop
   (consp (sig-fn x)))
 )
</pre>

Thus, we will only assign the constraint <code>(consp (sig-fn x))</code>, from
the theorem <code>sig-fn-prop</code>, to the function <code>sig-fn</code>, not to the
function <code>before1</code>.<p>

More generally, suppose an event in an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event does not
mention any function symbol in the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>,
nor any function symbol that mentions any such function symbol, and
so on.  (We might say that no function symbol from the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> is
an ``ancestor'' of any function symbol occurring in the event.)
Then we imagine moving the event, so that it appears in front of the
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>.  We don't actually move it, but we pretend we do when
it comes time to assign constraints.  Thus, such definitions only
introduce definitional axioms as the constraints on the function
symbols being defined, and such theorems introduce no constraints.<p>

Once this first optimization is performed, we have in mind a set of
``constrained functions.''  These are the functions introduced in
the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> that would remain after moving some of them out,
as indicated above.  Consider the collection of all formulas
introduced by the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, except the definitional axioms, that
mention these constrained functions.  So for example, in the event
below, no such formula mentions the function symbol <code>after1</code>.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))<p>

 (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))<p>

 (defthm sig-fn-prop
   (consp (sig-fn x)))<p>

 (defun after1 (x)
   (sig-fn x))
 )
</pre>

We can see that there is really no harm in imagining that we move
the definition of <code>after1</code> out of the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, to just after
the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>.<p>

Many subtle aspects of this rearrangement process have been omitted.
For example, suppose the function <code>fn</code> uses <code>sig-fn</code>, the latter
being a function in the signature of the encapsulation.  Suppose a
formula about <code>fn</code> is proved in the encapsulation.  Then from the
discussion above <code>fn</code> is among the constrained functions of the
encapsulate:  it cannot be moved before the encapsulate and it cannot
be moved after the encapsulation.  But why is <code>fn</code> constrained?
The reason is that the theorem proved about <code>fn</code> may impose or express
constraints on <code>sig-fn</code>.  That is, the theorem proved about <code>fn</code>
may depend upon properties of the witness used for <code>sig-fn</code>.
Here is a simple example:

<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))<p>

 (local (defun sig-fn (x) (declare (ignore x)) 0))<p>

 (defun fn (lst)
   (if (endp lst)
       t
       (and (integerp (sig-fn (car lst)))
            (fn (cdr lst)))))<p>

 (defthm fn-always-true
   (fn lst)))
</pre>

In this example, there are no explicit theorems about <code>sig-fn</code>, i.e.,
no theorems about it explicitly.  One might therefore conclude that
it is completely unconstrained.  But the witness we chose for it always
returns an integer.  The function <code>fn</code> uses <code>sig-fn</code> and we prove that
<code>fn</code> always returns true.  Of course, the proof of this theorem
depends upon the properties of the witness for <code>sig-fn</code>, even though
those properties were not explicitly ``called out'' in theorems proved
about <code>sig-fn</code>. It would be unsound to move <code>fn</code> after
the encapsulate.  It would also be unsound to constrain <code>sig-fn</code> to
satisfy just <code>fn-always-true</code> without including in the constraint
the relation between <code>sig-fn</code> and <code>fn</code>.  Hence both <code>sig-fn</code> and
<code>fn</code> are constrained by this encapsulation and the constraint imposed
on each is the same and states the relation between the two as characterized
by the equation defining <code>fn</code> as well as the property that <code>fn</code> always
returns true.  Suppose, later, one proved a theorem about <code>sig-fn</code> and
wished to functional instantiate it.  Then one must also functionally
instantiate <code>fn</code>, even if it is not involved in the theorem, because
it is only through <code>fn</code> that <code>sig-fn</code> inherits its constrained
properties.<p>

This is a pathological example that illustrate a trap into which one
may easily fall: rather than identify the key properties of the
constrained function the user has foreshadowed its intended
application and constrained those notions.
Clearly, the user wishing to introduce the <code>sig-fn</code> above would be
well-advised to use the following instead:

<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))
 (local (defun sig-fn (x) (declare (ignore x)) 0))
 (defthm integerp-sig-fn
   (integerp (sig-fn x))))

(defun fn (lst)
  (if (endp lst)
      t
    (and (integerp (sig-fn (car lst)))
         (fn (cdr lst)))))

(defthm fn-always-true
   (fn lst)))
</pre>

Note that <code>sig-fn</code> is constrained merely to be an integer.  It is
the only constrained function.  Now <code>fn</code> is introduced after the
encapsulation, as a simple function that uses <code>sig-fn</code>.  We prove
that <code>fn</code> always returns true, but this fact does not constrain
<code>sig-fn</code>.  Future uses of <code>sig-fn</code> do not have to consider
<code>fn</code> at all.<p>

Sometimes it is necessary to introduce a function such as <code>fn</code>
within the <code>encapsulate</code> merely to state the key properties of the
undefined function <code>sig-fn</code>.  But that is unusual and the user
should understand that both functions are being constrained.<p>

Another subtle aspect of encapsulation that has been brushed over so
far has to do with exactly how functions defined within the
encapsulation use the signature functions.  For example, above we
say ``Consider the collection of all formulas introduced by the
encapsulate, <em>except the definitional axioms</em>, that mention these
constrained functions.''  We seem to suggest that a definitional
axiom which mentions a constrained function can be moved out of the
encapsulation and considered part of the ``post-encapsulation''
extension of the logic, if the defined function is not used in any
non-definitional formula proved in the encapsulation.  For example,
in the encapsulation above that constrained <code>sig-fn</code> and introduced
<code>fn</code> within the encapsulation, <code>fn</code> was constrained because we
proved the formula <code>fn-always-true</code> within the encapsulation.  Had
we not proved <code>fn-always-true</code> within the encapsulation, <code>fn</code> could
have been moved after the encapsulation.  But this suggests an
unsound rule because whether such a function can be moved after the
encapsulate depend on whether its <em>admission</em> used properties of the
witnesses!  In particular, we say a function is ``subversive'' if
any of its governing tests or the actuals in any recursive call involve
a function in which the signature functions are ancestral.<p>

Another aspect we have not discussed is what happens to nested
encapsulations when each introduces constrained functions.  We say an
<code>encapsulate</code> event is ``trivial'' if it introduces no constrained
functions, i.e., if its signatures is <code>nil</code>.  Trivial encapsulations
are just a way to wrap up a collection of events into a single event.<p>

From the foregoing discussion we see we are interested in exactly
how we can ``rearrange'' the events in a non-trivial encapsulation
-- moving some ``before'' the encapsulation and others ``after'' the
encapsulation.  We are also interested in which functions introduced by
the encapsulation are ``constrained'' and what the ``constraints'' on
each are.

We may summarize the observations above as follows, after which we
conclude with a more elaborate example.<p>

<em>Second cut at constraint-assigning algorithm.</em>  First, we focus
only on non-trivial encapsulations that neither contain nor are
contained in non-trivial encapsulations.  (Nested non-trivial
encapsulations are not rearranged at all: do not put anything in
such a nest unless you mean for it to become part of the constraints
generated.)  Second, in what follows we only consider the
non-<code>local</code> events of such an <code>encapsulate</code>, assuming that they
satisfy the restriction of using no locally defined function symbols
other than the signature functions.  Given such an <code>encapsulate</code>
event, move, to just in front of it and in the same order, all
definitions and theorems for which none of the signature functions
is ancestral.  Now collect up all formulas (theorems) introduced in
the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> other than definitional axioms.  Add to this
set any of those definitional equations that is either subversive or
defines a function used in a formula in the set.  The
conjunction of the resulting set of formulas is called the
``constraint'' and the set of all the signature functions of the
<code>encapsulate</code> together with all function symbols defined in the
<code>encapsulate</code> and mentioned in the constraint is called the
``constrained functions.''  Assign the constraint to each of the
constrained functions.  Move, to just after the <code>encapsulate</code>, the
definitions of all function symbols defined in the <code>encapsulate</code> that
have been omitted from the constraint.<p>

Implementation note.  In the implementation we do not actually move
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, but we create constraints that pretend that we did.<p>

Here is an example illustrating our constraint-assigning algorithm.
It builds on the preceding examples.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))<p>

 (defun before1 (x)
   (if (consp x)
       (before1 (cdr x))
     x))<p>

 (local (defun sig-fn (x) (cons x x)))<p>

 (defthm sig-fn-prop
   (consp (sig-fn x)))<p>

 (defun during (x)
   (if (consp x)
       x
     (cons (car (sig-fn x))
           17)))<p>

 (defun before2 (x)
   (before1 x))<p>

 (defthm before2-prop
   (atom (before2 x)))<p>

 (defthm during-prop
   (implies (and (atom x)
                 (before2 x))
            (equal (car (during x))
                   (car (sig-fn x)))))<p>

 (defun after1 (x)
   (sig-fn x))<p>

 (defchoose after2 (x) (u)
   (and (&lt; u x) (during x)))
 )
</pre>

Only the functions <code>sig-fn</code> and <code>during</code> receive extra
constraints.  The functions <code>before1</code> and <code>before2</code> are viewed as
moving in front of the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, as is the theorem
<code>before2-prop</code>.  The functions <code>after1</code> and <code>after2</code> are viewed
as being moved past the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>.  Notice that the formula
<code>(consp (during x))</code> is a conjunct of the constraint.  It comes
from the <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rule deduced during the definition
of the function <code>during</code>.  The implementation reports the following.

<pre>
(SIG-FN X) is axiomatized to return one result.<p>

In addition, we export AFTER2, AFTER1, DURING-PROP, BEFORE2-PROP, BEFORE2,
DURING, SIG-FN-PROP and BEFORE1.<p>

The following constraint is associated with both of the functions DURING
and SIG-FN:<p>

(AND (EQUAL (DURING X)
            (IF (CONSP X)
                X (CONS (CAR (SIG-FN X)) 17)))
     (CONSP (DURING X))
     (CONSP (SIG-FN X))
     (IMPLIES (AND (ATOM X) (BEFORE2 X))
              (EQUAL (CAR (DURING X))
                     (CAR (SIG-FN X)))))
</pre>
<p>

We conclude by asking (and to a certain extent, answering) the
following question:  Isn't there an approach to assigning
constraints that avoids over-constraining more simply than our
``second cut'' above?  Perhaps it seems that given an
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, we should simply assign to each locally defined
function the theorems exported about that function.  If we adopted
that simple approach the events below would be admissible.<p>


<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((foo *) =&gt; *))
 (local (defun foo (x) x))
 (defun bar (x)
   (foo x))
 (defthm bar-prop
   (equal (bar x) x)
   :rule-classes nil))<p>

(defthm foo-id
  (equal (foo x) x)
  :hints (("Goal" :use bar-prop)))<p>

; The following event is not admissible in ACL2.<p>

(defthm ouch!
  nil
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints
  (("Goal" :use
    ((:functional-instance foo-id
                           (foo (lambda (x) (cons x x))))))))
</pre>

Under the simple approach we have in mind, <code>bar</code> is constrained to
satisfy both its definition and <code>bar-prop</code> because <code>bar</code> mentions
a function declared in the signature list of the encapsulation.  In
fact, <code>bar</code> is so-constrained in the ACL2 semantics of
encapsulation and the first two events above (the <code>encapsulate</code> and
the consequence that <code>foo</code> must be the identity function) are
actually admissible.  But under the simple approach to assigning
constraints, <code>foo</code> is unconstrained because no theorem about it is
exported.  Under that approach, <code>ouch!</code> is proveable because <code>foo</code>
can be instantiated in <code>foo-id</code> to a function other than the
identity function.<p>

It's tempting to think we can fix this by including definitions, not
just theorems, in constraints.  But consider the following slightly
more elaborate example.  The problem is that we need to include as
a constraint on <code>foo</code> not only the definition of <code>bar</code>, which
mentions <code>foo</code> explicitly, but also <code>abc</code>, which has <code>foo</code> as an
ancestor.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 (((foo *) =&gt; *))
 (local (defun foo (x) x))
 (local (defthm foo-prop
          (equal (foo x) x)))
 (defun bar (x)
   (foo x))
 (defun abc (x)
   (bar x))
 (defthm abc-prop
   (equal (abc x) x)
   :rule-classes nil))<p>

(defthm foo-id
  (equal (foo x) x)
  :hints (("Goal" :use abc-prop)))<p>

; The following event is not admissible in ACL2.<p>

(defthm ouch!
  nil
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints
  (("Goal" :use
    ((:functional-instance foo-id
                           (foo (lambda (x) (cons x x)))
                           (bar (lambda (x) (cons x x))))))))
