<h2>CURRENT-PACKAGE</h2>the package used for reading and printing

<code>Current-package</code> is an <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> special (see <a href="LD.html">ld</a>).  The accessor is
<code>(current-package state)</code> and the updater is
<code>(set-current-package val state)</code>, or more conventionally,
<code>(in-package val)</code>.  The value of <code>current-package</code> is actually
the string that names the package.  (Common Lisp's ``package''
objects do not exist in ACL2.)  The current package must be known to
ACL2, i.e., it must be one of the initial packages or a package
defined with <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> by the user.
<p>
When printing symbols, the package prefix is displayed if it is not
the <code>current-package</code> and may be optionally displayed otherwise.
Thus, if <code>current-package</code> is <code>"ACL2"</code> then the symbol <code>'ACL2::SYMB</code> may
be printed as <code>SYMB</code> or <code>ACL2::SYMB</code>, while <code>'MY-PKG::SYMB</code> must be
printed as <code>MY-PKG::SYMB</code>.  But if <code>current-package</code> is <code>"MY-PKG"</code> then
the former symbol must be printed as <code>ACL2::SYMB</code> while the latter may
be printed as <code>SYMB</code>.<p>

In Common Lisp, <code>current-package</code> also affects how objects are read
from character streams.  Roughly speaking, read and print are
inverses if the <code>current-package</code> is fixed, so reading from a stream
produced by printing an object must produce an equal object.<p>

In ACL2, the situation is more complicated because we never read
objects from character streams, we only read them from object
``streams'' (channels).  Logically speaking, the objects in such a
channel are fixed regardless of the setting of <code>current-package</code>.
However, our host file systems do not support the idea of Lisp
object files and instead only support character files.  So when you
open an object input channel to a given (character file) we must
somehow convert it to a list of ACL2 objects.  This is done by a
<i>deus ex machina</i> (``a person or thing that appears or is introduced
suddenly and unexpectedly and provides a contrived solution to an
apparently insoluble difficulty,'' Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary).  Roughly speaking, the <i>deus ex machina</i> determines what
sequence of calls to <code>read-object</code> will occur in the future and what
the <code>current-package</code> will be during each of those calls, and then
produces a channel containing the sequence of objects produced by an
analogous sequence of Common Lisp reads with <code>*current-package*</code> bound
appropriately for each.<p>

A simple rule suffices to make sane file <a href="IO.html">io</a> possible:  before you
read an object from an object channel to a file created by printing
to a character channel, make sure the <code>current-package</code> at read-time
is the same as it was at print-time.
