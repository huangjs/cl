The logic of ACL2 is based on Common Lisp.<p>

Common Lisp is the standard list processing programming language.
It is documented in:  Guy L. Steele, <b>Common Lisp The Language</B>,
Digital Press, 12 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, 1990.  See
also http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html.<p>

ACL2 formalizes only a subset of Common Lisp.  It includes such
familiar Lisp functions as <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> for creating
and manipulating list structures, various arithmetic primitives such
as <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>expt</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>intern</code> and <code>symbol-name</code> for
creating and manipulating symbols.  Control primitives include
<code>cond</code>, <code>case</code> and <code>if</code>, as well as function call, including
recursion.  New functions are defined with <code>defun</code> and macros with
<code>defmacro</code>.  See <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> for a list of the Common
Lisp primitives supported by ACL2.<p>

ACL2 is a very small subset of full Common Lisp.  ACL2 does not
include the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), higher order
functions, circular structures, and other aspects of Common Lisp
that are <b>non-applicative</B>.  Roughly speaking, a language is
applicative if it follows the rules of function application.  For
example, <code>f(x)</code> must be equal to <code>f(x)</code>, which means, among other
things, that the value of <code>f</code> must not be affected by ``global
variables'' and the object <code>x</code> must not change over time.<p>
