<h2>Common Lisp as a Modeling Language</h2>
<p>
<img src=common-lisp.gif><p>

In ACL2 we have adopted Common Lisp as the basis of our modeling language.
If you have already read our brief note on Common Lisp and recall
the example of <code>app</code>, please proceed.  Otherwise
click <a href="Common_Lisp.html">here</a> for an exceedingly brief introduction to
Common Lisp and then come <b>back</B> here.<p>

In Common Lisp it is very easy to write systems of formulas that
manipulate discrete, inductively constructed data objects.  In building
a model you might need to formalize the notion of sequences and define
such operations as concatenation, length, whether one is a permutation
of the other, etc.  It is easy to do this in Common Lisp.  Furthermore,
if you have a Common Lisp ``theory of sequences'' you can <b>run</B>
the operations and relations you define.  That is, you can execute
the functions on concrete data to see what results your formulas produce.<p>

If you define the function <code>app</code> as shown above and then type

<pre>
(app '(A B) '(C D E))
</pre>

in any Common Lisp, the answer will be computed and will be
<code>(A B C D E)</code>.<p>

The <b>executable</B> nature of Common Lisp and thus of ACL2 is very handy
when producing models.  <p>

But executability is not enough for a modeling language because the purpose
of models is to permit analysis.  <p>
