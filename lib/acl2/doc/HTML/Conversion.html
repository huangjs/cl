<h2>Conversion to Uppercase</h2>

When symbols are read by Common Lisp they are converted to upper case.
Note carefully that this remark applies to the characters in <em>symbols</em>.
The characters in strings are not converted upper case.
<p>
To type a symbol containing lower case characters you can enclose the
symbol in vertical bars, as in <code>|AbC|</code> or you can put a ``backslash''
before each lower case character you wish to preserve, as in <code>A\bC</code>.
<code>|AbC|</code> and <code>A\bC</code> are two different ways of writing the same
symbol (just like 2/4 and 1/2 are two different ways of writing the
same rational).  The symbol has three characters in its name, the
middle one of which is a lower case b.
