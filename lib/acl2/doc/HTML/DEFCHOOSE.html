General Form:
(defchoose fn 
           (bound-var1 ... bound-varn)
           (free-var1 ... free-vark)
           body
           :doc doc-string
           :strengthen b),
</pre>

where <code>fn</code> is the symbol you wish to define and is a new symbolic
name (see <a href="NAME.html">name</a>), <code>(bound-var1 ... bound-varn)</code> is a list of
distinct `bound' variables (see below), <code>(free-var1 ... free-vark)</code>
is the list of formal parameters of <code>fn</code> and is disjoint from the
bound variables, and <code>body</code> is a term.  The use of <code>lambda-list</code>
keywords (such as <code>&amp;optional</code>) is not allowed.  The <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
string argument, <code>:doc doc-string</code>, is optional; for a description of the
form of <code>doc-string</code> see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>.  The <code>:strengthen</code> keyword argument
is optional; if supplied, it must be <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.<p>

The system treats <code>fn</code> very much as though it were declared in the
<a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event, with a single axiom exported as
described below.  If you supply a <code>:use</code> hint (see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>), <code>:use fn</code>, it
will refer to that axiom.  No rule (of class <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or otherwise;
see <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>) is created for <code>fn</code>.<p>

<code>Defchoose</code> is only executed in <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>;
see <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>.  Also see <a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a>.<p>

In the most common case, where there is only one bound variable, it is
permissible to omit the enclosing parentheses on that variable.  The effect
is the same whether or not those parentheses are omitted.  We describe this
case first, where there is only one bound variable, and then address the
other case.  Both cases are discussed assuming <code>:strengthen</code> is <code>nil</code>,
which is the default.  We deal with the case <code>:strengthen t</code> at the end.<p>

The effect of the form

<pre>
(defchoose fn bound-var (free-var1 ... free-vark)
  body)
</pre>

is to introduce a new function symbol, <code>fn</code>, with formal parameters
<code>(free-var1 ... free-vark)</code>.  Now consider the following axiom, which
states that <code>fn</code> picks a value of <code>bound-var</code> so that the body will be
true, if such a value exists:

<pre>
(1)   (implies body
               (let ((bound-var (fn free-var1 ... free-vark)))
                 body))
</pre>

This axiom is ``clearly conservative'' under the conditions expressed above:
the function <code>fn</code> simply picks out a ``witnessing'' value of <code>bound-var</code>
if there is one.  For a rigorous statement and proof of this conservativity
claim, see <a href="CONSERVATIVITY-OF-DEFCHOOSE.html">conservativity-of-defchoose</a>.<p>

Next consider the case that there is more than one bound variable, i.e.,
there is more than one bound-var in the following.

<pre>
(defchoose fn 
           (bound-var1 ... bound-varn)
           (free-var1 ... free-vark)
           body)
</pre>

Then <code>fn</code> returns a multiple value with <code>n</code> componenets, and formula (1)
above is expressed using <code><a href="MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></code> as follows:

<pre>
(implies body
         (mv-let (bound-var1 ... bound-varn)
                 (fn free-var1 ... free-vark)
                 body))
</pre>
<p>

We now discuss the case that <code>:strengthen t</code> is supplied.  For simplicity
we return to our first example, with a single free variable, <code>y</code>.  The idea
is that if we pick the ``smallest'' witnessing <code>bound-var</code> for two
different free variables <code>y</code> and <code>y1</code>, then either those two witnesses
are the same, or else one is less than the other, in which case the smaller
one is a witness for its free variable but not for the other.  (See comments
in source function <code>defchoose-constraint-extra</code> for more details.)  Below,
<code>body1</code> is the result of replacing <code>y</code> by <code>y1</code> in <code>body</code>.

<pre>
(2)   (or (equal (fn y) (fn y1))
          (let ((bound-var (fn y)))
            (and body
                 (not body1)))
          (let ((bound-var (fn y1)))
            (and body1
                 (not body))))
</pre>

An important application of this additional axiom is to be able to define a
``fixing'' function that picks a canonical representative of each equivalence
class, for a given equivalence relation.  The following events illustrate
this point.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 ((equiv (x y) t))
 (local (defun equiv (x y) (equal x y)))
 (defequiv equiv))<p>

(defchoose efix (x) (y)
  (equiv x y)
  :strengthen t)<p>

(defthm equiv-implies-equal-efix-1
  (implies (equiv y y1)
           (equal (efix y) (efix y1)))
  :hints (("Goal" :use efix))
  :rule-classes (:congruence))<p>

(defthm efix-fixes
  (equiv (efix x) x)
  :hints (("Goal" :use ((:instance efix (y x))))))
</pre>
<p>

If there is more than one bound variable, then (2) is modified in complete
analogy to (1) to use <code><a href="MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></code> in place of <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code>.<p>

Comment for logicians:  As we point out in the documentation for
<code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code>, <code>defchoose</code> is ``appropriate,'' by which we mean that
it is conservative, even in the presence of <code>epsilon-0</code> induction.
For a proof, See <a href="CONSERVATIVITY-OF-DEFCHOOSE.html">conservativity-of-defchoose</a>.
