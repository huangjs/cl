<h2>DEFPKG</h2>define a new symbol package
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>

Example:
(defpkg "MY-PKG"
        (union-eq *acl2-exports*
                  *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))

<li><h3><a href="HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE.html">HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE</a> -- handling <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that are <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>
</h3>
</li>

<li><h3><a href="HIDDEN-DEFPKG.html">HIDDEN-DEFPKG</a> -- handling defpkg events that are local
</h3>
</li>

</ul>

General Form:
(defpkg "name" term doc-string)
</pre>
<p>

where <code>"name"</code> is a non-empty string consisting of standard characters
(see <a href="STANDARD-CHAR-P.html">standard-char-p</a>), none of which is lower case, that names the package
to be created; <code>term</code> is a variable-free expression that evaluates to a
list of symbols, where no two distinct symbols in the list may have the same
<code><a href="SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></code>, to be imported into the newly created package; and
<code><a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a></code> is an optional <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string; see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>.
The name of the new package must be ``new'': the host lisp must not contain
any package of that name.  There are two exceptions to this newness rule,
discussed at the end of this documentation.<p>

(There is actually an additional argument, book-path, that is used for error
reporting but has no logical content.  Users should generally ignore this
argument, as well as the rest of this sentence: a book-path will be specified
for <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> events added by ACL2 to the <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of a book's
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>; see <a href="HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE.html">hidden-death-package</a>.)<p>

<code>Defpkg</code> forms can be entered at the top-level of the ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>
loop.  They should not occur in <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> (see <a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>).<p>

After a successful <code>defpkg</code> it is possible to ``intern'' a string
into the package using <code><a href="INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a></code>.  The result
is a symbol that is in the indicated package, provided the imports
allow it.  For example, suppose <code>'my-pkg::abc</code> is a symbol whose
<code><a href="SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></code> is <code>"MY-PKG"</code>.  Suppose further that
the imports specified in the <code>defpkg</code> for <code>"MY-PKG"</code> do not include
a symbol whose <code><a href="SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></code> is <code>"XYZ"</code>.  Then

<pre>
(intern-in-package-of-symbol "XYZ" 'my-pkg::abc)
</pre>

returns a symbol whose <code><a href="SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></code> is <code>"XYZ"</code> and whose
<code><a href="SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></code> is <code>"MY-PKG"</code>.  On the other hand, if
the imports to the <code>defpkg</code> does include a symbol with the name 
<code>"XYZ"</code>, say in the package <code>"LISP"</code>, then

<pre>
(intern-in-package-of-symbol "XYZ" 'my-pkg::abc)
</pre>

returns that symbol (which is uniquely determined by the restriction
on the imports list above).  See <a href="INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a>.<p>

<code>Defpkg</code> is the only means by which an ACL2 user can create a new
package or specify what it imports.  That is, ACL2 does not support
the Common Lisp functions <code>make-package</code> or <code>import</code>.  Currently, ACL2
does not support exporting at all.<p>

The Common Lisp function <code><a href="INTERN.html">intern</a></code> is weakly supported by ACL2.
See <a href="INTERN.html">intern</a>.<p>

We now explain the two exceptions to the newness rule for package
names.  The careful experimenter will note that if a package is
created with a <code>defpkg</code> that is subsequently undone, the host lisp
system will contain the created package even after the undo.
Because ACL2 hangs onto <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s after they have been undone, e.g., to
implement <code>:</code><code><a href="OOPS.html">oops</a></code> but, more importantly, to implement error recovery,
we cannot actually destroy a package upon undoing it.  Thus, the
first exception to the newness rule is that <code>name</code> is allowed to be
the name of an existing package if that package was created by an
undone <code>defpkg</code> and the newly proposed set of imports is identical to the
old one.  See <a href="PACKAGE-REINCARNATION-IMPORT-RESTRICTIONS.html">package-reincarnation-import-restrictions</a>.  This
exception does not violate the spirit of the newness rule, since one
is disinclined to believe in the existence of undone packages.  The
second exception is that <code>name</code> is allowed to be the name of an
existing package if the package was created by a <code>defpkg</code> with
identical set of imports.  That is, it is permissible to execute
``redundant'' <code>defpkg</code> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s.  The redundancy test is based on the
values of the two import forms (comparing them after sorting and removing
duplicates), not on the forms themselves.<p>

Finally, we explain why we require the package name to contain standard
characters, none of which is lower case.  We have seen at least one
implementation that handled lower-case package names incorrectly.  Since we
see no need for lower-case characters in package names, which can lead to
confusion anyhow (note for example that <code>foo::bar</code> is a symbol whose
<code><a href="SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></code> is <code>"FOO"</code>, not <code>"foo"</code>), we simply
disallow them.  Since the notion of ``lower case'' is only well-specified in
Common Lisp for standard characters, we restrict to these.
