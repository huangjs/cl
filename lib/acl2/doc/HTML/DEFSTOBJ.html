<pre>
Example:
(defstobj st
          (reg :type (array (unsigned-byte 31) (8))
               :initially 0)
          (p-c :type (unsigned-byte 31) 
               :initially 555)
          halt                  ; = (halt :type t :initially nil)
          (mem :type (array (unsigned-byte 31) (64))
               :initially 0 :resizable t))<p>

General Form:
(defstobj name 
          (field1 :type type1 :initially val1 :resizable b1)
          ...
          (fieldk :type typek :initially valk :resizable bk)
          :renaming alist
          :doc doc-string
          :inline inline-flag)
</pre>

where <code>name</code> is a new symbol, each <code>fieldi</code> is a symbol, each
<code>typei</code> is either a <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> or <code>(ARRAY</code> <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> <code>(max))</code>,
each <code>vali</code> is an object satisfying <code>typei</code>, and each <code>bi</code> is <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.
Each pair <code>:initially vali</code> and <code>:resizable bi</code> may be omitted; more
on this below.  The <code>alist</code> argument is optional and allows the user
to override the default function names introduced by this event.
The <code><a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a></code> is also optional.  The <code>inline-flag</code> Boolean argument
is also optional and declares to ACL2 that the generated access and update
functions for the stobj should be implemented as macros under the hood (which
has the effect of inlining the function calls).  We describe further
restrictions on the <code>fieldi</code>, <code>typei</code>, <code>vali</code>, and on
<code>alist</code> below.  We recommend that you read about
single-threaded objects (stobjs) in ACL2 before proceeding;
see <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.<p>

The effect of this event is to introduce a new single-threaded
object (i.e., a ``<a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>''), named <code>name</code>, and the associated
recognizers, creator, accessors, updaters, constants, and, for
fields of <code>ARRAY</code> type, length and resize functions.

<p>
<em>The Single-Threaded Object Introduced</em><p>

The <code>defstobj</code> event effectively introduces a new global
variable, named <code>name</code>, which has as its initial logical value
a list of <code>k</code> elements, where <code>k</code> is the number of ``field
descriptors'' provided.  The elements are listed in the same order
in which the field descriptors appear.  If the <code>:type</code> of a field
is <code>(ARRAY type-spec (max))</code> then the corresponding element of
the stobj is initially a list of length <code>max</code> containing the value,
<code>val</code>, specified by <code>:initially val</code>.  Otherwise, the <code>:type</code>
of the field is a <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> and the corresponding element of
the stobj is the specified initial value <code>val</code>.  (The actual
representation of the stobj in the underlying Lisp may be quite
different; see <a href="STOBJ-EXAMPLE-2.html">stobj-example-2</a>.  For the moment we
focus entirely on the logical aspects of the object.)<p>

In addition, the <code>defstobj</code> event introduces functions for
recognizing and creating the stobj and for recognizing, accessing,
and updating its fields.  For fields of <code>ARRAY</code> type, length and
resize functions are also introduced.  Constants are introduced that
correspond to the accessor functions.<p>

<em>Restrictions on the Field Descriptions in Defstobj</em><p>

Each field descriptor is of the form:

<pre>
(fieldi :TYPE typei :INITIALLY vali)
</pre>

Note that the type and initial value are given in ``keyword
argument'' format and may be given in either order.  The <code>typei</code>
and <code>vali</code> ``arguments'' are not evaluated.  If omitted, the type
defaults to <code>t</code> (unrestricted) and the initial value defaults to
<code>nil</code>.<p>

Each <code>typei</code> must be either a <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> or else a list of
the form <code>(ARRAY type-spec (max))</code>.  The latter forms are said to
be ``array types.''  Examples of legal <code>typei</code> are:

<pre>
(INTEGERP 0 31)
(SIGNED-BYTE 31)
(ARRAY (SIGNED-BYTE 31) (16))
</pre>
<p>

The <code>typei</code> describes the objects which are expected to occupy
the given field.  Those objects in <code>fieldi</code> should satisfy
<code>typei</code>.  We are more precise below about what we mean by
``expected.''  We first present the restrictions on <code>typei</code> and
<code>vali</code>.<p>

Non-Array Types<p>

When <code>typei</code> is a <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> it restricts the contents,
<code>x</code>, of <code>fieldi</code> according to the ``meaning'' formula given in
the table for <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code>.  For example, the first <code>typei</code>
above restricts the field to be an integer between 0 and 31,
inclusive.  The second restricts the field to be an integer between
-2^30 and (2^30)-1, inclusive.<p>

The initial value, <code>vali</code>, of a field description may be any ACL2
object but must satisfy <code>typei</code>.  Note that <code>vali</code> is not a
form to be evaluated but an object.  A form that evaluates to
<code>vali</code> could be written <code>'vali</code>, but <code>defstobj</code> does not
expect you to write the quote mark.  For example, the field
description

<pre>
(days-off :initially (saturday sunday))
</pre>

describes a field named <code>days-off</code> whose initial value is the list
consisting of the two symbols <code>SATURDAY</code> and <code>SUNDAY</code>.  In
particular, the initial value is NOT obtained by applying the
function <code>saturday</code> to the variable <code>sunday</code>!  Had we written

<pre>
(days-off :initially '(saturday sunday))
</pre>

it would be equivalent to writing

<pre>
(days-off :initially (quote (saturday sunday)))
</pre>

which would initialize the field to a list of length two, whose first
element is the symbol <code>quote</code> and whose second element is a list
containing the symbols <code>saturday</code> and <code>sunday</code>.<p>

Array Types<p>

When <code>typei</code> is of the form <code>(ARRAY type-spec (max))</code>, the
field is supposed to be a list of items, initially of length <code>max</code>,
each of which satisfies the indicated <code>type-spec</code>.  <code>Max</code> must be a
non-negative integer less than (2^28)-1.  We discuss this limitation
below. Thus,

<pre>
(ARRAY (SIGNED-BYTE 31) (16))
</pre>

restricts the field to be a list of integers, initially of length
16, where each integer in the list is a <code>(SIGNED-BYTE 31)</code>.  We
sometimes call such a list an ``array'' (because it is represented
as an array in the underlying Common Lisp).  The elements of an
array field are indexed by position, starting at 0.  Thus, the
maximum legal index of an array field is <code>max</code>-1.<p>

Note that the <code>ARRAY</code> type requires that the <code>max</code> be enclosed
in parentheses.  This makes ACL2's notation consistent with the
Common Lisp convention of describing the (multi-)dimensionality of
arrays.  But ACL2 currently supports only single dimensional arrays
in stobjs.<p>

For array fields, the initial value <code>vali</code> must be an object satisfying
the <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> of the <code>ARRAY</code> description.  The initial value
of the field is a list of <code>max</code> repetitions of <code>vali</code>.<p>

Array fields can be ``resized,'' that is, their lengths can be
changed, if <code>:resizable t</code> is supplied as shown in the example and
General Form above.  The new length must satisfy the same
restriction as does <code>max</code>, as described above.  Each array field in a
<code>defstobj</code> event gives rise to a length function, which gives the
length of the field, and a resize function, which modifies the
length of the field if <code>:resizable t</code> was supplied with the field when
the <code>defstobj</code> was introduced and otherwise causes an error.<p>

Array resizing is relatively slow, so we recommend using it somewhat
sparingly.<p>

<em>The Default Function Names</em><p>

To recap, in

<pre>
(defstobj name 
          (field1 :type type1 :initially val1)
          ...
          (fieldk :type typek :initially valk)                
          :renaming alist
          :doc doc-string
          :inline inline-flag)
</pre>

<code>name</code> must be a new symbol, each <code>fieldi</code> must be a symbol,
each <code>typei</code> must be a <code><a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a></code> or <code>(ARRAY type-spec (max))</code>,
and each <code>vali</code> must be an object satisfying <code>typei</code>.<p>

Roughly speaking, for each <code>fieldi</code>, a <code>defstobj</code> introduces a
recognizer function, an accessor function, and an updater function.
The accessor function, for example, takes the stobj and returns the
indicated component; the updater takes a new component value and the
stobj and return a new stobj with the component replaced by the new
value.  But that summary is inaccurate for array fields.<p>

The accessor function for an array field does not take the stobj
and return the indicated component array, which is a list of length
<code>max</code>.  Instead, it takes an additional index argument and
returns the indicated element of the array component.  Similarly,
the updater function for an array field takes an index, a new
value, and the stobj, and returns a new stobj with the indicated
element replaced by the new value.<p>

These functions -- the recognizer, accessor, and updater, and also
length and resize functions in the case of array fields -- have
``default names.''  The default names depend on the field name,
<code>fieldi</code>, and on whether the field is an array field or not.  For
clarity, suppose <code>fieldi</code> is named <code>c</code>. The default names are
shown below in calls, which also indicate the arities of the
functions.  In the expressions, we use <code>x</code> as the object to be
recognized by field recognizers, <code>i</code> as an array index, <code>v</code> as
the ``new value'' to be installed by an updater, and <code>name</code> as the
single-threaded object.<p>


<pre>
                 non-array field        array field
recognizer         (cP x)                (cP x)
accessor           (c name)              (cI i name)
updater            (UPDATE-c v name)     (UPDATE-cI i v name)
length                                   (c-LENGTH name)
resize                                   (RESIZE-c k name)
</pre>
<p>

Finally, a recognizer and a creator for the entire single-threaded
object are introduced.  The creator returns the initial stobj, but
may only be used in limited contexts; see <a href="WITH-LOCAL-STOBJ.html">with-local-stobj</a>.  If
the single-threaded object is named <code>name</code>, then the default names
and arities are as shown below.

<pre>
top recognizer     (nameP x)
creator            (CREATE-name)
</pre>
<p>

For example, the event

<pre>
(DEFSTOBJ $S
  (X :TYPE INTEGER :INITIALLY 0)
  (A :TYPE (ARRAY (INTEGER 0 9) (3)) :INITIALLY 9))
</pre>

introduces a stobj named <code>$S</code>.  The stobj has two fields, <code>X</code> and
<code>A</code>.  The <code>A</code> field is an array.  The <code>X</code> field contains an
integer and is initially 0.  The <code>A</code> field contains a list of
integers, each between 0 and 9, inclusively.  Initially, each of the
three elements of the <code>A</code> field is 9.<p>

This event introduces the following sequence of definitions:

<pre>
(DEFUN XP (X) ...)               ; recognizer for X field
(DEFUN AP (X) ...)               ; recognizer of A field
(DEFUN $SP ($S) ...)             ; top-level recognizer for stobj $S
(DEFUN CREATE-$S () ...)         ; creator for stobj $S
(DEFUN X ($S) ...)               ; accessor for X field
(DEFUN UPDATE-X (V $S) ...)      ; updater for X field
(DEFUN A-LENGTH ($S) ...)        ; length of A field
(DEFUN RESIZE-A (K $S) ...)      ; resizer for A field
(DEFUN AI (I $S) ...)            ; accessor for A field at index I
(DEFUN UPDATE-AI (I V $S) ...)   ; updater for A field at index I
</pre>
<p>

<em>Avoiding the Default Function Names</em><p>

If you do not like the default names listed above you may use the
optional <code>:renaming</code> alist to substitute names of your own
choosing.  Each element of <code>alist</code> should be of the form
<code>(fn1 fn2)</code>, where <code>fn1</code> is a default name and <code>fn2</code> is your choice
for that name.<p>

For example

<pre>
(DEFSTOBJ $S
  (X :TYPE INTEGER :INITIALLY 0)
  (A :TYPE (ARRAY (INTEGER 0 9) (3)) :INITIALLY 9)
  :renaming ((X XACCESSOR) (CREATE-$S MAKE$S)))
</pre>

introduces the following definitions   

<pre>
(DEFUN XP (X) ...)               ; recognizer for X field
(DEFUN AP (X) ...)               ; recognizer of A field
(DEFUN $SP ($S) ...)             ; top-level recognizer for stobj $S
(DEFUN MAKE$S () ...)            ; creator for stobj $S
(DEFUN XACCESSOR ($S) ...)       ; accessor for X field
(DEFUN UPDATE-X (V $S) ...)      ; updater for X field
(DEFUN A-LENGTH ($S) ...)        ; length of A field
(DEFUN RESIZE-A (K $S) ...)      ; resizer for A field
(DEFUN AI (I $S) ...)            ; accessor for A field at index I
(DEFUN UPDATE-AI (I V $S) ...)   ; updater for A field at index I
</pre>

Note that even though the renaming alist substitutes ``<code>XACCESSOR</code>''
for ``<code>X</code>'' the updater for the <code>X</code> field is still called
``<code>UPDATE-X</code>.''  That is because the renaming is applied to the
default function names, not to the field descriptors in the
event.<p>

Use of the <code>:renaming</code> alist may be necessary to avoid name
clashes between the default names and and pre-existing function
symbols.<p>

<em>Constants</em><p>

<code>Defstobj</code> events also introduce constant definitions
(see <a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a>).  One constant is introduced for each accessor
function by prefixing and suffixing a `<code>*</code>' character on the function
name.  The value of that constant is the position of the field being
accessed.  For example, if the accessor functions are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>,
in that order, then the following constant definitions are introduced.

<pre>
(defconst *a* 0)
(defconst *b* 1)
(defconst *c* 2)
</pre>

These constants are used for certain calls of <code><a href="NTH.html">nth</a></code> and <code><a href="UPDATE-NTH.html">update-nth</a></code>
that are displayed to the user in proof output.  For example, for
stobj <code>st</code> with accessor functions <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, in that order, the
term <code>(nth '2 st)</code> would be printed during a proof as <code>(nth *c* st)</code>.
Also see <a href="TERM.html">term</a>, in particular the discussion there of untranslated
terms, and see <a href="NTH-ALIASES-TABLE.html">nth-aliases-table</a>.<p>

<em>Inspecting the Effects of a Defstobj</em><p>

Because the stobj functions are introduced as ``sub-events'' of the
<code>defstobj</code> the history commands <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="PC.html">pc</a></code>
will not print the definitions of these functions but will print
the superior <code>defstobj</code> event.  To see the definitions of these
functions use the history command <code>:</code><code><a href="PCB_bang_.html">pcb!</a></code>.<p>

To see an s-expression containing the definitions what constitute the raw
Lisp implementation of the event, evaluate the form

<pre>
(nth 4 (global-val 'cltl-command (w state)))
</pre>

<em>immediately after</em> the <code>defstobj</code> event has been processed.<p>

A <code>defstobj</code> is considered redundant only if the name, field descriptors,
renaming alist, and inline flag are identical to a previously executed
<code>defstobj</code>.  Note that a redundant <code>defstobj</code> does not reset the
<a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a> fields to their initial values.<p>

<em>Inlining and Performance</em><p>

The <code>:inline</code> keyword argument controls whether or not accessor, updater,
and length functions are inlined (as macros under the hood, in raw Lisp).  If
<code>:inline t</code> is provided then these are inlined; otherwise they are not.
The advantage of inlining is potentially better performance; there have been
contrived examples, doing essentially nothing except accessing and updating
array fields, where inlining reduced the time by a factor of 10 or more; and
inlining has sped up realistic examples by a factor of at least 2.  Inlining
may get within a factor of 2 of C execution times for such contrived
examples, and within a few percent of C execution times on realistic
examples.<p>

A drawback to inlining is that redefinition may not work as expected, much as
redefinition may not work as expected for macros: defined functions that call
a macro, or inlined stobj function, will not see a subsequent redefinition of
the macro or inlined function.  Another drawback to inlining is that because
inlined functions are implemented as macros in raw Lisp, tracing
(see <a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a>) will not show their calls.  These drawbacks are avoided by
default, but the user who is not concerned about them is advised to specify
<code>:inline t</code>.
