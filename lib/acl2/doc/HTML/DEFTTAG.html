<h2>DEFTTAG</h2>introduce a trust tag (ttag)
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
General Forms:
(defttag tag-name)
(defttag tag-name :doc doc-string)
</pre>

where <code>tag-name</code> is a symbol.  The <code>:doc doc-string</code> argument is
optional; if supplied, then it must be a valid <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string
(see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>), and the <code>defttag</code> call will generate a corresponding
<code><a href="DEFDOC.html">defdoc</a></code> event.  For the rest of this discussion we ignore the <code>:doc</code>
argument.<p>

<strong>WARNING!</strong>  This event is intended for advanced users who, in essence,
want to build extensions of ACL2.  Anyone who uses this event, even by way of
including books, is placing trust in the correctness of all forms executed in
the scope of that <code>defttag</code> event.  (Thus, it may be a good idea if the
scope of a <code>defttag</code> event, which is the enclosing book or
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event, is kept small.)  The documentation below explains
this issue in detail.<p>

This event introduces or removes a so-called active trust tag (or ``ttag'',
pronounced ``tee tag'').  An active ttag is a non-<code>nil</code> symbol (tag) that
is associated with potentially unsafe acts.  For example, <code><a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></code> can
be used in an unsafe way, for example to overwrite files, or worse
(see <a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> for a frightening example from Bob Boyer).  Therefore, calls
of <code><a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></code> are illegal unless a <code>defttag</code> event has been executed.
If one introduces an active ttag and then writes definitions that calls
<code><a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></code>, presumably in a defensibly ``safe'' way, then responsibility
for those calls is attributed to that ttag.  This attribution (or blame!) is
at the level of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>; a book's <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> contains a list of
ttags that are active in that book, or in a book that is included (possibly
<a href="LOCAL.html">local</a>ly), or in a book included in a book that is included (either
inclusion being potentially <a href="LOCAL.html">local</a>), and so on.  We explain all this in
more detail below.<p>

<code>(Defttag tag-name)</code> is essentially equivalent to

<pre>
(table acl2-defaults-table :ttag tag-name)
</pre>

and hence is <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> to any <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> and <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>
in which it occurs; see <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.  We say more about the scope of
<code>defttag</code> forms below.<p>

Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event summary but
nevertheless executes the above <code><a href="TABLE.html">table</a></code> event and hence changes the ACL2
logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, and is so recorded.  Although no event summary is
printed, it is important to note that the ``TTAG NOTE'', discussed below, is
always printed for a non-nil <code>tag-name</code>.
<p>
<strong>Active ttags.</strong>  Suppose <code>tag-name</code> is a non-<code>nil</code> symbol.  Then
<code>(defttag tag-name)</code> sets <code>tag-name</code> to be the ``active ttag.''  There
must be an active ttag in order for there to be any mention of certain
function and macro symbols, including <code><a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></code>; evaluate the form
<code>(strip-cars *ttag-fns-and-macros*)</code> to see the full list of such symbols.
On the other hand, <code>(defttag nil)</code> removes the active ttag, if any; there
is then no active ttag.  The scope of a <code>defttag</code> form in a book being
certified or included is limited to subsequent forms in the same book before
the next <code>defttag</code> (if any) in that book.  Similarly, if a <code>defttag</code> form
is evaluated in the top-level loop, then its effect is limited to subsequent
forms in the top-level loop before the next <code>defttag</code> in the top-level loop
(if any).  Moreoever, <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is illegal when a ttag is active; of
course, in such a circumstance one can execute <code>(defttag nil)</code> in order to
allow book certification.<p>

<strong>Ttag notes and the ``certifier.''</strong>  When a <code>defttag</code> is executed with
an argument other than <code>nil</code>, output is printed, starting on a fresh line
with:  <code>TTAG NOTE</code>.  For example:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(defttag foo)<p>

TTAG NOTE: Adding ttag FOO from the top level loop.
 FOO
ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>

If the <code>defttag</code> occurs in an included book, the message looks like this.

<pre>
TTAG NOTE (for included book): Adding ttag FOO from file /u/smith/acl2/my-book.lisp.
</pre>

The ``<code>TTAG NOTE</code>'' message is always printed on a single line.  The
intention is that one can search the standard output for all such notes in
order to find all <i>defttag</i> events.  In a sense, <i>defttag</i> events can
allow you to define your own system on top of ACL2 (for example,
see <a href="PROGN_bang_.html">progn!</a>).  So in order for someone else (who we might call the
``certifier'') to be confident that your collection of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> is
meaningful, that certifier should certify all the user-supplied books from
scratch and check either that no <code>:ttags</code> were supplied to
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>, or else look for every <code>TTAG NOTE</code> in the standard
output in order to locate all <code>defttag</code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> with non-<code>nil</code>
tag-name.  In this way, the certifier can in principle decide whether to be
satisfied that those <code>defttag</code> events did not allow inappropriate forms in
the user-supplied books.<p>

<strong>Allowed ttags when certifying and including books.</strong>  A <code>defttag</code> form
may not be evaluated unless its argument is a so-called ``allowed'' ttag.
All ttags are allowed in the interactive top-level loop.  However, during
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> and <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>, the set of allowed ttags is
restricted according to the <code>:ttags</code> keyword argument.  If this argument is
omitted then no ttag is allowed, so a <code>defttag</code> call will fail during book
certification or inclusion in this case.  This restriction applies even to
<code>defttag</code> forms already evaluated in the so-called certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>
at the time <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is called.  But note that <code>(defttag nil)</code> is
always legal.<p>

A <code>:ttags</code> argument of <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> and <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> can have
value <code>:all</code>, indicating that every ttag is allowed, i.e., no restriction
is being placed on the arguments, just as in the interactive top-level loop.
Otherwise, the value is a true list of ttag specifications, each having one
of the following forms, where <code>sym</code> is a non-<code>nil</code> symbol.

<blockquote>
(1) <code>sym</code><p>

(2) <code>(sym)</code><p>

(3) <code>(sym x1 x2 ... xk)</code>, where k &gt; 0 and each <code>xi</code> is a string, except
that one <code>xi</code> may be <code>nil</code>.</blockquote>
<p>

In Case (1), <code>(defttag sym)</code> is allowed to occur in at most one book or
else in the top-level loop (i.e., the certification world for a book under
certification or a book being included).  Case (2) allows <code>(defttag sym)</code>
to occur in an unlimited number of books.  For case (3) the <code>xi</code> specify
where <code>(defttag sym)</code> may occur, as follows.  The case that <code>xi</code> is
<code>nil</code> refers to the top-level loop, while all other <code>xi</code> are filenames,
where the <code>".lisp"</code> extension is optional and relative pathnames are
considered to be relative to the connected book directory (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>).<p>

An error message, as shown below, illustrates how ACL2 enforcess the notion
of allowed ttags.  Suppose that you call <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> with argument
<code>:ttags (foo)</code>, where you have already executed <code>(defttag foo)</code> in the
certification world (i.e., before calling <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>).  Then ACL2
immediately associates the ttag <code>foo</code> with <code>nil</code>, where again, <code>nil</code>
refers to the top-level loop.  If ACL2 then encounters <code>(defttag foo)</code>
inside that book, you will get the following error (using the full book name
for the book, as shown):

<pre>
ACL2 Error in ( TABLE ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE ...):  The ttag FOO associated
with file /u/smith/work/my-book.lisp is not among the set of ttags permitted
in the current context, namely:
  ((FOO NIL)).
See :DOC defttag.
</pre>

In general the structure displayed by the error message, which is
<code>((FOO NIL))</code> in this case, represents the currently allowed ttags with
elements as discussed in (1) through (3) above.  In this case, that list's
unique element is <code>(FOO NIL)</code>, meaning that ttag <code>FOO</code> is only allowed at
the top level (as represented by <code>NIL</code>).<p>

<strong>Associating ttags with books and with the top-level loop.</strong>  When a book
is certified, each form <code>(defttag tag)</code> that is encountered for non-<code>nil</code>
<code>tag</code> in that book or an included book is recorded in the generated
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>, which associates <code>tag</code> with the <a href="FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> of
the book containing that <code>deftag</code>.  If such a <code>defttag</code> form is
encountered outside a book, hence in the <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of the book being
certified or one of its included books, then <code>tag</code> is associated with
<code>nil</code> in the generated <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>.  Note that the notion of
``included book'' here applies to the recursive notion of a book either
included directly in the book being certified or else included in such a
book, where we account even for <a href="LOCAL.html">local</a>ly included books.<p>
