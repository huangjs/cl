<h2>DEFUN-MODE-CAVEAT</h2>functions with <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> of <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> considered unsound
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

Technically speaking, in the current implementation, the execution
of functions having <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> may damage the ACL2 system
in a way that renders it unsound.  See <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> for a
discussion of <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>s.  That discussion describes an imagined
implementation that is slightly different from this one.  This note
explains that the current implementation is open to unsoundness.<p>

For discussion of a different soundness issue that is also related
to function execution, see <a href="GENERALIZED-BOOLEANS.html">generalized-booleans</a>.
<p>
The execution of a function having <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> may violate
Common Lisp <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s on the subroutines used.  (This may be true even
for calls of a function on arguments that satisfy its <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, because
ACL2 has not verified that its <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is sufficient to protect its
subroutines.)  When a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is violated at runtime all bets are off.
That is, no guarantees are made either about the answer being
``right'' or about the continued rationality of the ACL2 system
itself.<p>

For example, suppose you make the following <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>:

<pre><p>

(defun crash (i)
  (declare (xargs :mode :program :guard (integerp i)))
  (car i))
</pre>
<p>

Note that the declared guard does not in fact adequately protect the
subroutines in the body of <code>crash</code>; indeed, satisfying the guard to
<code>crash</code> will guarantee that the <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> expression is in violation
of its guard.  Because this function is admitted in
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>-mode, no checks are made concerning the suitability
of the guard.  Furthermore, in the current ACL2 implementation,
<code>crash</code> is executed directly in Common Lisp.  Thus if you call
<code>crash</code> on an argument satisfying its guard you will cause an
erroneous computation to take place.<p>


<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(crash 7)

Error: Caught fatal error [memory may be damaged]
...
</pre>

There is no telling how much damage is done by this errant
computation.  In some lisps your ACL2 job may actually crash back to
the operating system.  In other lisps you may be able to recover
from the ``hard error'' and resume ACL2 in a damaged but apparently
functional image.<p>

THUS, HAVING A FUNCTION WITH <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">DEFUN-MODE</a> <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">PROGRAM</a></code> IN YOUR SYSTEM
ABSOLVES US, THE ACL2 IMPLEMENTORS, FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
SOUNDNESS OF OUR SYSTEM.<p>

Furthermore<p>

ACL2 DOES NOT YET PROVIDE ANY MEANS OF REGAINING ASSURANCES OF
SOUNDNESS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF A FUNCTION IN <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">PROGRAM</a></code> MODE,
EVEN IF IT IS ULTIMATELY CONVERTED TO <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">LOGIC</a></code> MODE (since its
execution could have damaged the system in a way that makes it
possible to verify its termination and <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s unsoundly).<p>

Finally,<p>

THE VAST MAJORITY OF ACL2 SYSTEM CODE IS IN <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">PROGRAM</a></code> MODE AND SO ALL
BETS ARE OFF FROM BEFORE YOU START!<p>

This hopeless state of current affairs will change, we think.  We
think we have defined our functions ``correctly'' in the sense that
they can be converted, without ``essential'' modification, to
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode.  We think it very unlikely that a mis-guarded
function in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode (whether ours or yours) will cause
unsoundness without some sort of hard lisp error accompanying it.
We think that ultimately we can make it possible to execute your
functions (interpretively) without risk to the system, even when some have
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode.  In that imagined implementation, code using
functions having <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode would run more slowly, but safely.
These functions could be introduced into the logic ex post facto,
whereupon the code's execution would speed up because Common Lisp
would be allowed to execute it directly.  We therefore ask that you
simply pretend that this is that imagined implementation, introduce
functions in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode, use them as convenient and perhaps
ultimately introduce some of them in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode and prove their
properties.  If you use the system this way we can develop (or
dismiss) this style of formal system development.  BUT BE ON THE
LOOKOUT FOR SCREWUPS DUE TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE EXECUTION OF YOUR
FUNCTIONS HAVING <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">PROGRAM</a></code> MODE!
