General Form:
(defun-sk fn (var1 ... varn) body
  &amp;key rewrite doc quant-ok skolem-name thm-name witness-dcls)
</pre>

where <code>fn</code> is the symbol you wish to define and is a new symbolic
name (see <a href="NAME.html">name</a>), <code>(var1 ... varn)</code> is its list of formal
parameters (see <a href="NAME.html">name</a>), and <code>body</code> is its body, which must be
quantified as described below.  The <code>&amp;key</code> argument <code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> is an optional
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string to be associated with <code>fn</code>; for a description
of its form, see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>.  In the case that <code>n</code> is 1, the list
<code>(var1)</code> may be replaced by simply <code>var1</code>.  The other arguments are
explained below.<p>

For a simple example, see <a href="DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">defun-sk-example</a>.  For a more elaborate example,
see <a href="TUTORIAL4-DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">Tutorial4-Defun-Sk-Example</a>.  Also see <a href="QUANTIFIERS.html">quantifiers</a> for an example
illustrating how the use of recursion, rather than explicit quantification
with <code>defun-sk</code>, may be preferable.<p>

Below we describe the <code>defun-sk</code> event precisely.  First, let us
consider the examples above.  The first example, again, is:

<pre>
(defun-sk exists-x-p0-and-q0 (y z)
  (exists x
          (and (p0 x y z)
               (q0 x y z))))
</pre>

It is intended to represent the predicate with formal parameters <code>y</code>
and <code>z</code> that holds when for some <code>x</code>, <code>(and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))</code>
holds.  In fact <code>defun-sk</code> is a macro that adds the following two
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, as shown just below.  The first event guarantees that if
this new predicate holds of <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, then the term shown,
<code>(exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness y z)</code>, is an example of the <code>x</code> that is
therefore supposed to exist.  (Intuitively, we are axiomatizing
<code>exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness</code> to pick a witness if there is one.)
Conversely, the second event below guarantees that if there is any
<code>x</code> for which the term in question holds, then the new predicate does
indeed hold of <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>. 

<pre>
(defun exists-x-p0-and-q0 (y z)
  (declare (xargs :non-executable t))
  (let ((x (exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness y z)))
    (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
(defthm exists-x-p0-and-q0-suff
  (implies (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))
           (exists-x-p0-and-q0 y z)))
</pre>

Now let us look at the third example from the introduction above:

<pre>
(defun-sk forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
  (forall (x y)
          (and (p0 x y z)
               (q0 x y z))))
</pre>

The intention is to introduce a new predicate
<code>(forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)</code> which states that the indicated conjunction
holds of all <code>x</code> and all <code>y</code> together with the given <code>z</code>.  This time, the
axioms introduced are as shown below.  The first event guarantees
that if the application of function <code>forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-witness</code> to
<code>z</code> picks out values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for which the given term
<code>(and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))</code> holds, then the new predicate
<code>forall-x-y-p0-and-q0</code> holds of <code>z</code>.  Conversely, the (contrapositive
of) the second axiom guarantees that if the new predicate holds of
<code>z</code>, then the given term holds for all choices of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> (and that
same <code>z</code>). 

<pre>
(defun forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
  (declare (xargs :non-executable t))
  (mv-let (x y)
          (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-witness z)
          (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
(defthm forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc
  (implies (not (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z)))
           (not (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z))))
</pre>

The examples above suggest the critical property of <code>defun-sk</code>:  it
indeed does introduce the quantified notions that it claims to
introduce.<p>

Notice that the <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event just above, <code>forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc</code>,
may not be of optimal form as a rewrite rule.  Users sometimes find that when
the quantifier is <code>forall</code>, it is useful to state this rule in a form where
the new quantified predicate is a hypothesis instead.  In this case that form
would be as follows:

<pre>
(defthm forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc
  (implies (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)
           (and (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
</pre>

ACL2 will turn this into one <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rule for each conjunct,
<code>(p0 x y z)</code> and <code>(q0 x y z)</code>, with hypothesis
<code>(forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)</code> in each case.  In order to get this effect, use
<code>:rewrite :direct</code>, in this case as follows.

<pre>
(defun-sk forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
  (forall (x y)
          (and (p0 x y z)
               (q0 x y z)))
  :rewrite :direct)
</pre>
<p>

We now turn to a detailed description <code>defun-sk</code>, starting with a
discussion of its arguments as shown in the "General Form" above.<p>

The third argument, <code>body</code>, must be of the form

<pre>
(Q bound-vars term)
</pre>

where:  <code>Q</code> is the symbol <code><a href="FORALL.html">forall</a></code> or <code><a href="EXISTS.html">exists</a></code> (in the "ACL2"
package), <code>bound-vars</code> is a variable or true list of variables
disjoint from <code>(var1 ... varn)</code> and not including <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>, and
<code>term</code> is a term.  The case that <code>bound-vars</code> is a single variable
<code>v</code> is treated exactly the same as the case that <code>bound-vars</code> is
<code>(v)</code>.<p>

The result of this event is to introduce a ``Skolem function,'' whose name is
the keyword argument <code>skolem-name</code> if that is supplied, and otherwise is
the result of modifying <code>fn</code> by suffixing "-WITNESS" to its name.  The
following definition and one of the following two theorems (as indicated) are
introduced for <code>skolem-name</code> and <code>fn</code> in the case that <code>bound-vars</code>
(see above) is a single variable <code>v</code>.  The name of the <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event
may be supplied as the value of the keyword argument <code>:thm-name</code>; if it is
not supplied, then it is the result of modifying <code>fn</code> by suffixing
"-SUFF" to its name in the case that the quantifier is <code><a href="EXISTS.html">exists</a></code>, and
"-NECC" in the case that the quantifier is <code><a href="FORALL.html">forall</a></code>.

<pre>
(defun fn (var1 ... varn)
  (declare (xargs :non-executable t))
  (let ((v (skolem-name var1 ... varn)))
    term))<p>

(defthm fn-suff ;in case the quantifier is EXISTS
  (implies term
           (fn var1 ... varn)))<p>

(defthm fn-necc ;in case the quantifier is FORALL
  (implies (not term)
           (not (fn var1 ... varn))))
</pre>
<p>

In the <code>forall</code> case, however, the keyword pair <code>:rewrite :direct</code> may be
supplied after the body of the <code>defun-sk</code> form, in which case the
contrapositive of the above form is used instead:

<pre>
(defthm fn-necc ;in case the quantifier is FORALL
  (implies (fn var1 ... varn)
           term))
</pre>

This is often a better choice for the "-NECC" rule, provided ACL2 can parse
<code>term</code> as a <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rule.  A second possible value of the
<code>:rewrite</code> argument of <code>defun-sk</code> is <code>:default</code>, which gives the same
behavior as when <code>:rewrite</code> is omitted.  Otherwise, the value of
<code>:rewrite</code> should be the term to use as the body of the <code>fn-necc</code> theorem
shown above; ACL2 will attempt to do the requisite proof in this case.  If
that term is weaker than the default, the properties introduced by
<code>defun-sk</code> may of course be weaker than they would be otherwise.  Finally,
note that the <code>:rewrite</code> keyword argument for <code>defun-sk</code> only makes sense
if the quantifier is <code>forall</code>; it is thus illegal if the quantifier is
<code>exists</code>.  Enough said about <code>:rewrite</code>!<p>

In the case that <code>bound-vars</code> is a list of at least two variables, say
<code>(bv1 ... bvk)</code>, the definition above (with no keywords) is the following
instead, but the theorem remains unchanged.

<pre>
(defun fn (var1 ... varn)
  (declare (xargs :non-executable t))
  (mv-let (bv1 ... bvk)
          (skolem-name var1 ... varn)
          term))
</pre>
<p>

In order to emphasize that the last element of the list, <code>body</code>, is a
term, <code>defun-sk</code> checks that the symbols <code><a href="FORALL.html">forall</a></code> and <code><a href="EXISTS.html">exists</a></code> do
not appear anywhere in it.  However, on rare occasions one might
deliberately choose to violate this convention, presumably because
<code><a href="FORALL.html">forall</a></code> or <code><a href="EXISTS.html">exists</a></code> is being used as a variable or because a
macro call will be eliminating ``calls of'' <code><a href="FORALL.html">forall</a></code> and <code><a href="EXISTS.html">exists</a></code>.
In these cases, the keyword argument <code>quant-ok</code> may be supplied a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  Then <code>defun-sk</code> will permit <code><a href="FORALL.html">forall</a></code> and
<code><a href="EXISTS.html">exists</a></code> in the body, but it will still cause an error if there is
a real attempt to use these symbols as quantifiers.<p>

Note the form <code>(declare (xargs :non-executable t))</code> that appears in each
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> above.  These forms disable certain checks that are required for
execution, in particular the single-threaded use of <code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code>s.  However,
there is a price: calls of these defined functions cannot be evaluated.
Normally that is not a problem, since these notions involve quantifiers.  But
you are welcome to replace this <code><a href="DECLARE.html">declare</a></code> form with your own, as follows:
if you supply a list of <code>declare</code> forms to keyword argument
<code>:witness-dcls</code>, these will become the declare forms in the generated
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>.<p>

<code>Defun-sk</code> is a macro implemented using <code><a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></code>, and hence should
only be executed in <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>; see <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and
see <a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.<p>

If you find that the rewrite rules introduced with a particular use of
<code>defun-sk</code> are not ideal, even when using the <code>:rewrite</code> keyword
discussed above (in the <code>forall</code> case), then at least two reasonable
courses of action are available for you.  Perhaps the best option is to prove
the <code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rules you want.  If you see a pattern for creating rewrite
rules from your <code>defun-sk</code> events, you might want to write a macro that
executes a <code>defun-sk</code> followed by one or more <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> events.  Another
option is to write your own variant of the <code>defun-sk</code> macro, say,
<code>my-defun-sk</code>, for example by modifying a copy of the definition of
<code>defun-sk</code> from the ACL2 sources.<p>

If you want to represent nested quantifiers, you can use more than one
<code>defun-sk</code> event.  For example, in order to represent

<pre>
(forall x (exists y (p x y z)))
</pre>

you can use <code>defun-sk</code> twice, for example as follows.

<pre>
(defun-sk exists-y-p (x z)
  (exists y (p x y z)))<p>

(defun-sk forall-x-exists-y-p (z)
  (forall x (exists-y-p x z)))
</pre>
<p>

Some distracting and unimportant warnings are inhibited during
<code>defun-sk</code>.<p>

Note that this way of implementing quantifiers is not a new idea.  Hilbert
was certainly aware of it 60 years ago!  Also
see <a href="CONSERVATIVITY-OF-DEFCHOOSE.html">conservativity-of-defchoose</a> for a technical argument that justifies the
logical conservativity of the <code><a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></code> event in the sense of the paper
by Kaufmann and Moore entitled ``Structured Theory Development for a
Mechanized Logic'' (Journal of Automated Reasoning 26, no. 2 (2001),
pp. 161-203).
