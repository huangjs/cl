Use <code>(get-doc-string 'name state)</code> to see other examples.<p>

<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">Documentation</a> strings not beginning with ``<code>:Doc-Section</code>'' (case is
irrelevant) are ignored.  See <a href="MARKUP.html">markup</a> for how to supply
formatting information (such as fonts and displayed text) in
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings.
<p>
ACL2 attaches special importance to <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings beginning
with the header ``<code>:Doc-Section</code>'' (or any variant thereof obtained by
changing case).  Any <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string that does not begin with
such a header is considered unformatted and is ignored.  For the
rest of this discussion, we use the phrase ``<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string''
as though it read ``formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string.''<p>

<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">Documentation</a> strings are always processed in the context of some
symbol, <code>name</code>, being defined.  (Indeed, if an event defines no
symbol, e.g., <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code> or <code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code>, then it is not permitted
to have a formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string.)  The string will be
associated with name in the ``<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> data base.'' The data
base is divided into ``sections'' and each section is named by a
symbol.  Among the sections are <code><a href="EVENTS.html">events</a></code>, <code><a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a></code>, <code><a href="HISTORY.html">history</a></code>,
<code><a href="OTHER.html">other</a></code>, and <code><a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">miscellaneous</a></code>.  A complete list of the sections may be
obtained by typing <code>:docs *</code> at the terminal.  You can create new
sections.  The main purpose of sections is simply to partition the
large set of names into smaller subsets whose contents can be
enumerated separately.  The idea is that the user may remember (or
recognize) the relevant section name and then read its contents to
find interesting items.<p>

Within a section are ``<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> tuples'' which associate with
each documented name its <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string and a list of related
documented names, called the ``related names'' of the name.  When
<code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> prints the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for name, it always lists the related
names.<p>

When a formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string is submitted with the defining
event of some name, the section name and an initial set of related
names are parsed from the string.  In addition, the formatted string
contains various ``levels'' of detail that are printed out at
different times.  Finally, it is possible for a string to cause the
newly documented name to be added to the related names of any
previously documented name.  Thus, as new names are introduced they
can be grouped with old ones.<p>

The general form of an ACL2 formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string is

<pre>
":DOC-SECTION &lt;section-name&gt;
  &lt;one-liner&gt;~/
  &lt;notes&gt;~/
  &lt;details&gt;~/
  :CITE &lt;n1&gt;
  ...
  :CITE &lt;nn&gt;
  :CITED-BY &lt;m1&gt;
  ...
  :CITED-BY &lt;mm&gt;"
</pre>

Before we explain this, let it be noted that
<code>(get-doc-string name state)</code> will return the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string
associated with <code>name</code> in the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> data base.  You may
want to call <code>get-doc-string</code> on <code>'</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> and <code>'</code><code><a href="UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></code> just
to see some concrete <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings.  This <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
string, which is rather long, is under <code>'doc-string</code>.<p>

A formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string has five parts: the header and
section-name (terminating in the first <code>#\Newline</code>), the <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;notes&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> (each terminating in a tilde-slash (``<code>~/</code>'')
pair), and a citation part.  These five parts are parsed into six
components.  <code>&lt;section-name&gt;</code> is read as the name of a symbol,
section-name.  <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> are arbitrary
sequences of <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> (ignoring initial white space and not
including the tilde-slash pairs which terminate them).  The <code>&lt;ni&gt;</code> are
read as symbols and assembled into a list called the ``cite''
symbols.  The <code>&lt;mi&gt;</code> are read as symbols and assembled into a list
called the ``cited-by'' symbols.  See the warning below regarding
the hackish nature of our symbol reader.<p>

<code>Section-name</code> must either be a previously documented symbol or else
be <code>name</code>, the symbol being documented.  To open a new section of the
data base, named <code>section-name</code>, you should define the logical name
section-name (as by <code><a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></code> or any other event; also
see <a href="DEFDOC.html">defdoc</a>) and attach to it a <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string for section
section-name.  You might wish to print out the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string
we use for some of our section names, e.g.,
<code>(get-doc-string 'events state)</code>.  By forcing section names to be
documented symbols, we permit sections themselves to have one line
descriptions and discussions, presented by the standard
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> facilities like the facilities <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="MORE-DOC.html">more-doc</a></code> that
may be used at the terminal.<p>

Each of the <code>ni</code>'s and <code>mi</code>'s must be previously documented symbols.<p>

Both <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> must be non-empty, i.e., must contain
some non-whitespace <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>.  <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code> may be empty.  The <code>:cite</code>s
and <code>:cited-by</code>s pairs may be intermingled and may be separated by
either newlines or spaces.  The citation part may be empty.  When
the citation part is empty, the tilde-slash pair terminating the
<code>&lt;details&gt;</code> part may be omitted.  Thus, the simplest form of a
formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string is:

<pre>
":Doc-Section &lt;section-name&gt;
 &lt;one-liner&gt;~/~/
 &lt;details&gt;"
</pre>

Since white space at the front of <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;details&gt;</code> is ignored, we often precede those parts by <code>#\Newline</code>s to
make the strings easier to read in our source files.  We also
typically indent all of the text in the string by starting each line
with a few spaces.  (The Emacs commands for formatting Lisp get
confused if you have arbitrary <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> on the left margin.)  We
assume that every line in <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> starts
with at least as many spaces as <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code> does, i.e., we assume
they are all indented the same amount (or more).  Let <code>d</code> be the
number of spaces separating <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code> from the <code>#\Newline</code>
preceding it.  When the various parts are printed, we ``de-indent''
by stripping out the first d spaces following each <code>#\Newline</code>.<p>

However, we find that when <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> is printed flush against
the left margin it is difficult to distinguish the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
text from previous output.  We therefore prefix each line we print
by a special pad of <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>.  By default, this pad is ``<code>| </code>'' so
that <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> text has a vertical bar running down the left
margin.  But the pad is just the value of the global variable
<code>doc-prefix</code> and you may <code><a href="ASSIGN.html">assign</a></code> it any string you wish.<p>

To add such a string to the data base under the symbol <code>name</code> we make
a new entry in the section-name section of the data base.  The entry
associates <code>name</code> with the string and uses the string's cites list as
the initial value of the related names field.  In addition, we add
<code>name</code> to the related names field of each of the names listed in the
string's cited-by list.  We also add <code>name</code> to the related names field
of its section-name.  Observe that the cites list in a string is
only the initial value of the related names of the names.  Future
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings may add to it via <code>:cited-by</code> or <code>:doc-section</code>.
Indeed, this is generally the case.  We discuss this further below.<p>

When a brief description of <code>name</code> is required (as by <code>:docs **</code>), <code>name</code>
and <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code> are printed.  <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code> is usually printed
starting in column 15 (however see <a href="PRINT-DOC-START-COLUMN.html">print-doc-start-column</a>).
Despite its name, <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code> need not be one line.  It usually is
one line, however.<p>

When you type <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> name at the terminal, the first response will be
to print <code>name</code> and <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code>.  Then <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> prints <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code>, if any.
Then, if <code>name</code> is the name of a section, it prints the <code>&lt;one-liner&gt;</code>s
for each of its related names.  For example, try <code>:doc events</code>.  If
<code>name</code> is not a section name but does have some related names, they
are merely listed but not explained.  Try <code>:doc theory-functions</code>.
<code>:more-doc name</code> prints <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.<p>

Our style is to let each new concept add itself to the related names
of old concepts.  To do otherwise increases the chances that
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> gets outdated because one often forgets to update
supposedly complete lists of the relevant topics when new topics are
invented.  For example, <code>:doc theory-functions</code> lists each available
theory function.  But <code>get-doc-string</code> of <code>'</code><code><a href="THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a></code> just
shows a few examples and has an empty cites list.  From where do we
get the names of the theory functions listed by <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code>?  The answer is
that each theory function has its own <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string and those
strings each specify <code>:cited-by</code> <a href="THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a>.  See for example
<code>get-doc-string</code> of <code>'</code><code><a href="UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></code>.  So by the time the entire system
is assembled, the related names of <code>'</code><code><a href="THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a></code> contains all
the (documented) theory functions.  This makes it easy to add new
theory functions without changing the general discussion in
<code>'</code><code><a href="THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a></code>.<p>

When an event or <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> form is printed, as by <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="PC.html">pc</a></code>, that
contains a formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string, we do not print the
actual <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string (since they are usually large and
distracting).  Instead we print the string:

<pre>
  "Documentation available via :doc"
</pre>

inviting you to use <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="MORE-DOC.html">more-doc</a></code> (or <code>get-doc-string</code>) if you
wish to see the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> at the terminal.<p>

<em>Warning on Reading Symbols from Strings:</em> When we read a symbol, such
as the section-symbol, from a <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string, we use a quick
and dirty imitation of the much more powerful CLTL <code>read</code> program.  In
particular, we scan past any whitespace, collect all the <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>
we see until we get to more whitespace or the end of the string,
convert the <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> to upper case, make a string out of them, and
<code><a href="INTERN.html">intern</a></code> that string.  Thus, if you typed <code>":Doc-Section 123 ..."</code> we
would read the <code>123</code> as the symbol <code>|123|</code>.  Observe that special
<a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>, such as parentheses and escape <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>, are not
afforded their usual reverence by our hack.  Furthermore, the
question arises: in which package do we <code><a href="INTERN.html">intern</a></code> the symbol?  The
answer is, usually, the package containing the name being defined.
I.e., if you are documenting <code>my-pkg::name</code> and you attach a
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string that begins <code>":Doc-Section: Machines ..."</code> then
the section-symbol will be <code>my-pkg::machines</code>.  We recognize two
special cases. If the first character read is a colon, we use the
<code>keyword</code> package.  If the first five <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> read are <code>acl2::</code> then
we <a href="INTERN.html">intern</a> in the <code>"ACL2"</code> package.  Our own section names, e.g.,
<code><a href="EVENTS.html">events</a></code>, are in the <code>"ACL2"</code> package.<p>

In a related area, when you ask for the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of a name,
e.g., when you type <code>:doc name</code> at the terminal, that name is read
with the full ACL2 reader, not the hack just described.  That name
is read into the current package.  Thus, if you are operating
<code><a href="IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></code> <code>"MY-PKG"</code> and type <code>:doc events</code>, what is read is
<code>my-pkg::events</code>.  The data base may not contain an entry for this
symbol.  Before reporting that no <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> exists, we try
<code>acl2::events</code>.<p>

One last note: <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> permits a formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string,
which is associated in the data base with the name of the package.
But the name of the package is a string, not a symbol.  It is
permitted to access the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of a string (i.e., package
name).  But there are no facilities for getting such a <code><a href="STRINGP.html">stringp</a></code> name
into the related names of another name nor of making such <a href="STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
names be section names.  That is because we always read symbols from
strings and never read strings from strings.  I.e., if you did write
<code>"Doc-Section \"MY-PKG\" ..."</code> it would read in as a weird
symbol.
