<h2>DOCS</h2>available <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topics (by section)
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">DOCUMENTATION</a>
</pre><p>

NOTE:  The <code>:docs</code> command only makes sense at the terminal.<p>

When the <code>:docs</code> command is given a <code><a href="STRINGP.html">stringp</a></code> argument it searches the
text produced by <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="MORE-DOC.html">more-doc</a></code> and lists all the
documented topics whose text contains the given string.  For purposes of this
string matching we ignore distinctions of case and the amount and kind (but
not presence) of white space.  We also treat hyphen as whitespace.<p>

However, the following examples show how <code>:docs</code> can be used on other than
string patterns.<p>


<pre>
Examples:
ACL2 !&gt;:docs *           ; lists documentation sections
ACL2 !&gt;:docs **          ; lists all documented topics within all sections
ACL2 !&gt;:docs events      ; lists all topics in section EVENTS
ACL2 !&gt;:docs "compil"    ; lists topics ``apropos''
</pre>

<p>
The data base of formatted <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings is structured into
sections.  Within a section are topics.  Each topic has a one-liner,
some notes, and some detailed discussions.  The <code>:docs</code> command
provides a view of the entire data base.<p>

<code>:docs</code> takes one argument, as described below:

<pre>
arg               effect<p>

*                 list all section headings in the data base
**                list all section headings and all topics within
                  each section
name              list all topics in the section named name (where
                  name is some symbol other than * and **).  This
                  is always the same as :doc name.
pattern           list all topics whose :doc or :more-doc text
                  mentions the string pattern.  For purposes of this
                  string matching we ignore distinctions of case and
                  the amount and kind (but not presence) of white
                  space.  We also treat hyphen as whitespace.
