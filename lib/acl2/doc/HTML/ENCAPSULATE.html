General Form:

<p>

where each <code><a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a></code> is a well-formed signature (see <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>), each
<code>signature</code> describes a different function symbol, and each <code>evi</code> is an
embedded event form (See <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).  There must be at least one
<code>evi</code>.  The <code>evi</code> inside <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> special forms are called ``local''
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> below.  <a href="EVENTS.html">Events</a> that are not <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> are sometimes said
to be ``exported'' by the encapsulation.  We make the further restriction
that no <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> event may be introduced in the scope of an
<code>encapsulate</code> (not even by <code>encapsulate</code> or <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> events
that are among the <code>evi</code>).  Furthermore, no non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event is permitted in the scope of any <code>encapsulate</code>
with a non-empty list of signatures.<p>

To be well-formed, an <code>encapsulate</code> event must have the properties that
each event in the body (including the <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> ones) can be successfully
executed in sequence and that in the resulting theory, each function
mentioned among the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s was introduced via a <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> event
and has the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> listed.  (A utility is provided to assist in
debugging failures of such execution; see <a href="REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a>.)  In addition, the body
may contain no ``local incompatibilities'' which, roughly stated, means that
the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that are not <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> must not syntactically require
symbols defined by <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <code><a href="EVENTS.html">events</a></code>, except for the functions listed
in the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s.  See <a href="LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a>.  Finally, no
non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> recursive definition in the body may involve in its suggested
induction scheme any function symbol listed among the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s.
See <a href="SUBVERSIVE-RECURSIONS.html">subversive-recursions</a>.<p>

The result of an <code>encapsulate</code> event is an extension of the logic
in which, roughly speaking, the functions listed in the
<a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s are constrained to have the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s listed
and to satisfy the non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> theorems proved about them.  In
fact, other functions introduced in the <code>encapsulate</code> event may be
considered to have ``<a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s'' as well.  (See <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>
for details, which are only relevant to functional instantiation.)
Since the <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s were all theorems in the ``ephemeral'' or
``local'' theory, we are assured that the extension produced by
<code>encapsulate</code> is sound.  In essence, the <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> definitions of
the constrained functions are just ``witness functions'' that
establish the consistency of the <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s.  Because those
definitions are <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>, they are not present in the theory
produced by encapsulation.  <code>Encapsulate</code> also exports all rules
generated by its non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, but rules generated by
<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> are not exported.<p>

The <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a> for the first event in an encapsulation is
the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> ``outside'' the encapsulation.  But since
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> changing the <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> are permitted within the body of an
<code>encapsulate</code>, the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> may be changed.  However,
<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> changes occurring within the body of the <code>encapsulate</code>
are not exported.  In particular, the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> after
an <code>encapsulate</code> is always the same as it was before the
<code>encapsulate</code>, even though the <code>encapsulate</code> body might contain
<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> changing <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>.
See <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>.  More generally, after execution of an
<code>encapsulate</code> event, the value of <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> is
restored to what it was immediately before that event was executed.
See <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.<p>

Theorems about the constrained function symbols may then be proved
-- theorems whose proofs necessarily employ only the <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s.
Thus, those theorems may be later functionally instantiated, as with
the <code>:functional-instance</code> lemma instance
(see <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>), to derive analogous theorems about
different functions, provided the constraints (see <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>)
can be proved about the new functions.<p>

Observe that if the <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s list is empty, <code>encapsulate</code> may still
be useful for deriving theorems to be exported whose proofs require
lemmas you prefer to hide (i.e., made <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>).<p>

The order of the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in the vicinity of an <code>encapsulate</code> is
confusing.  We discuss it in some detail here because when logical
names are being used with theory functions to compute sets of rules,
it is sometimes important to know the order in which <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> were
executed.  (See <a href="LOGICAL-NAME.html">logical-name</a> and see <a href="THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a>.)
What, for example, is the set of function names extant in the middle
of an encapsulation?<p>

If the most recent event is <code>previous</code> and then you execute an
<code>encapsulate</code> constraining <code>an-element</code> with two non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in its
body, <code>thm1</code> and <code>thm2</code>, then the order of the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> after the
encapsulation is (reading chronologically forward): <code>previous</code>, <code>thm1</code>,
<code>thm2</code>, <code>an-element</code> (the <code>encapsulate</code> itself).  Actually, between
<code>previous</code> and <code>thm1</code> certain extensions were made to the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> by the
superior <code>encapsulate</code>, to permit <code>an-element</code> to be used as a function
symbol in <code>thm1</code>.<p>

Finally, we note that an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event is redundant if and
only if a syntactically identical <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> has already been
executed under the same <code><a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a></code>.
