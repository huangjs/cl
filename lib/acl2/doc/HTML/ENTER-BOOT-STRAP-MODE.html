<h2>ENTER-BOOT-STRAP-MODE</h2>The first millisecond of the Big Bang

ACL2 functions, e.g., <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code>, that show <code>enter-boot-strap-mode</code> as their
defining <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> are in fact primitives.  It is impossible for the
system to display defining axioms about these symbols.
<p>
<code>Enter-boot-strap-mode</code> is a Common Lisp function but not an ACL2
function.  It magically creates from <code>nil</code> an ACL2 property list <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>
that lets us start the boot-strapping process.  That is, once
<code>enter-boot-strap-mode</code> has created its <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, it is possible to
process the <code><a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></code>s, <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>s, and <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code>s, necessary to bring up
the rest of the system.  Before that <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> is created, the attempt
by ACL2 even to translate a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> form, say, would produce an error
because <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> is undefined.<p>

Several ACL2 functions show <code>enter-boot-strap-mode</code> as their defining
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  Among them are <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code>, <code><a href="CONS.html">cons</a></code>, <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code>, and <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code>.  These functions
are characterized by axioms rather than definitional equations --
axioms that in most cases are built into our code and hence do not
have any explicit representation among the rules and formulas in the
system.
