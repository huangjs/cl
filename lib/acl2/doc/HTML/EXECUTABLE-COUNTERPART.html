<h2>EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART</h2>a rule for computing the value of a function
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>

which may be abbreviated in <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> as

<p>
Every <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> introduces at least two rules used by the theorem
prover.  Suppose <code>fn</code> is the name of a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>'d function.  Then
<code>(:definition fn)</code> is the rune (see <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>) naming the rule that
allows the simplifier to replace calls of <code>fn</code> by its instantiated
body.  <code>(:executable-counterpart fn)</code> is the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> for the rule for how
to evaluate the function on known constants.<p>

When typing <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> it is convenient to know that <code>(fn)</code> is a runic
designator that denotes <code>(:executable-counterpart fn)</code>.
See <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>.<p>

If <code>(:executable-counterpart fn)</code> is <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d, then when applications
of <code>fn</code> to known constants are seen by the simplifier they are
computed out by executing the Common Lisp code for <code>fn</code> (with the
appropriate handling of <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s).  Suppose <code>fact</code> is defined as the
factorial function.  If the executable counterpart <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> of <code>fact</code>,
<code>(:executable-counterpart fact)</code>, is <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d when the simplifier
encounters <code>(fact 12)</code>, then that term will be ``immediately''
expanded to <code>479001600</code>.  Note that even if subroutines of <code>fn</code> have
disabled executable counterparts, <code>fn</code> will call their Lisp code
nonetheless:  once an executable counterpart function is applied, no
subsidiary enable checks are made.<p>

Such one-step expansions are sometimes counterproductive because
they prevent the anticipated application of certain lemmas about the
subroutines of the expanded function.  Such computed expansions can
be prevented by disabling the executable counterpart <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> of the
relevant function.  For example, if <code>(:executable-counterpart fact)</code>
is <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d, <code>(fact 12)</code> will not be expanded by computation.  In this
situation, <code>(fact 12)</code> may be rewritten to <code>(* 12 (fact 11))</code>, using the
rule named <code>(:definition fact)</code>, provided the system's heuristics
permit the introduction of the term <code>(fact 11)</code>.  Note that lemmas
about multiplication may then be applicable (while such lemmas would
be inapplicable to <code>479001600</code>).  In many proofs it is desirable to
<a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a> the executable counterpart <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s of certain functions to
prevent their expansion by computation.
See <a href="EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART-THEORY.html">executable-counterpart-theory</a>.<p>

Finally:  What do we do about functions that are ``constrained''
rather than defined, such as the following?  (See <a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>.)

<pre>
(encapsulate (((foo *) =&gt; *))
             (local (defun foo (x) x)))
</pre>

Does <code>foo</code> have an executable counterpart?  Yes:  since the vast
majority of functions have sensible executable counterparts, it was
decided that <strong>all</strong> functions, even such ``constrained'' ones, have
executable counterparts.  We essentially ``trap'' when such calls
are inappropriate.  Thus, consider for example:

<pre>
(defun bar (x)
  (if (rationalp x)
      (+ x 1)
    (foo x)))
</pre>

If the term <code>(bar '3)</code> is encountered by the ACL2 rewriter during a
proof, and if the <code>:executable-counterpart</code> of <code>bar</code> is <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d, then it
will be invoked to reduce this term to <code>'4</code>.  However, if the term
<code>(bar 'a)</code> is encountered during a proof, then since <code>'a</code> is not a
<code><a href="RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a></code> and since the <code>:executable-counterpart</code> of <code>foo</code> is only a
``trap,'' then this call of the <code>:executable-counterpart</code> of <code>bar</code> will
result in a ``trap.'' In that case, the rewriter will return the
term <code>(hide (bar 'a))</code> so that it never has to go through this process
again.  See <a href="HIDE.html">hide</a>.
