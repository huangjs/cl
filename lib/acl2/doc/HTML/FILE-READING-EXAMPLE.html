<h4>FILE-READING-EXAMPLE</h4>example of reading files in ACL2
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="TUTORIAL5-MISCELLANEOUS-EXAMPLES.html">TUTORIAL5-MISCELLANEOUS-EXAMPLES</a>
</pre><p>

This example illustrates the use of ACL2's <a href="IO.html">IO</a> primitives to read the
forms in a file.  See <a href="IO.html">io</a>.
<p>
This example provides a solution to the following problem.  Let's
say that you have a file that contains s-expressions.  Suppose that
you want to build a list by starting with <code>nil</code>, and updating it
``appropriately'' upon encountering each successive s-expression in
the file.  That is, suppose that you have written a function
<code>update-list</code> such that <code>(update-list obj current-list)</code> returns
the list obtained by ``updating'' <code>current-list</code> with the next
object, <code>obj</code>, encountered in the file.  The top-level function for
processing such a file, returning the final list, could be defined
as follows.  Notice that because it opens a channel to the given
file, this function modifies <a href="STATE.html">state</a> and hence must return <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.
Thus it actually returns two values:  the final list and the new
<a href="STATE.html">state</a>.

<pre><p>

  (defun process-file (filename state)
    (mv-let
     (channel state)
     (open-input-channel filename :object state)
     (mv-let (result state)
             (process-file1 nil channel state) ;see below
             (let ((state (close-input-channel channel state)))
               (mv result state)))))<p>

</pre>

The function <code>process-file1</code> referred to above takes the currently
constructed list (initially, <code>nil</code>), together with a channel to the
file being read and the <a href="STATE.html">state</a>, and returns the final updated
list.  Notice that this function is tail recursive.  This is
important because many Lisp compilers will remove tail recursion,
thus avoiding the potential for stack overflows when the file
contains a large number of forms.

<pre><p>

  (defun process-file1 (current-list channel state)
    (mv-let (eofp obj state)
            (read-object channel state)
            (cond
             (eofp (mv current-list state))
             (t (process-file1 (update-list obj current-list)
                               channel state)))))<p>
