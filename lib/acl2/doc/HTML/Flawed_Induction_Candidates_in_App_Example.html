<h2>Flawed Induction Candidates in App Example</h2>
<p>
Induction on <b>a</B> is unflawed:  every occurrence of <b>a</B> in
the conjecture<p>


<pre>
(equal (app (app <b>a</B> b) c)
       (app <b>a</B> (app b c)))
</pre>

is in a position being recursively decomposed!<p>

Now look at the occurrences of <code>b</code>.  The first (shown in <b>bold</B> below)
is in a position that is held constant in the recursion of <code>(app a b)</code>.
It would be ``bad'' to induct on <code>b</code> here.<p>


<pre>
(equal (app (app a <b>b</B>) c)
       (app a (app b c)))
</pre>
