<h2>GCL</h2>tips on building and using ACL2 based on Gnu Common Lisp
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

See the installation instructions for basic information about building ACL2
on top of GCL, including information about where to fetch GCL.  Here, we
provide some tips that may be useful.
<p>
1. You can place forms to evaluate at start-up into file <code>init.lsp</code> in the
directory where you are starting ACL2 (GCL), or into file <code>acl2-init.lsp</code>
in your home directory.  For example, in order to evaluate both of the lisp
forms mentioned in 2 below, you could put them both into <code>init.lsp</code> in the
current directory or in <code>~/acl2-init.lsp</code> (either way, without <code>(lp)</code> or
<code>:q</code>):

<pre>
(setq si::*optimize-maximum-pages* nil)
(si::allocate 'cons 75000 t)
</pre>
<p>

2. Suppose you run out of space, for example with an error like this:

<pre>
   Error: The storage for CONS is exhausted.
     Currently, 59470 pages are allocated.
     Use ALLOCATE to expand the space.
</pre>

The following suggestion from Camm Maguire will minimize the heap size, at
the cost of more garbage collection time.

<pre>
:q   ; exit the ACL2 loop
(setq si::*optimize-maximum-pages* nil)
(lp) ; re-enter the ACL2 loop
</pre>

A second thing to try, suggested by several people, is to preallocate more
pages before the run, e.g.:

<pre>
:q   ; exit the ACL2 loop
(si::allocate 'cons 75000 t)
(lp) ; re-enter the ACL2 loop
</pre>

Also see <a href="RESET-KILL-RING.html">reset-kill-ring</a> for a suggestion on how to free up space.<p>

3. Windows users have seen this error:

<pre>
cc1.exe: unrecognized option `-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss'
</pre>

Camm Maguire suggests that a solution may be to evaluate the following in GCL
before building ACL2.

<pre>
(in-package 'compiler)
(let* ((x `-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss')
       (i (search x *cc*))) 
        (setq *cc* (concatenate 'string 
                                (subseq *cc* 0 i)
                                (subseq *cc* (+ i (length x))))))
</pre>
<p>

4. It is possible to profile using ACL2 built on GCL.  See file
<code>save-gprof.lsp</code> in the ACL2 source directory.<p>

5. Some versions of GCL may have garbage-collector bugs that, on rare
occasions, cause ACL2 (when built on GCL) to break.  If you run into this,
a solution may be to execute the following:

<pre>
:q
(si::sgc-on nil)
(lp)
</pre>

Alternatively, put <code>(si::sgc-on nil)</code> in your <code>~/acl2-init.lsp</code> file.<p>

A full regression test and found that this decreased performance by about
10%.  But even with that, GCL may be the fastest Common Lisp for ACL2 on
Linux (performance figures may often be found by following the ``Recent
changes'' link on the ACL2 home page).<p>
