<h2>GENERALIZE</h2>make a rule to restrict generalizations
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">RULE-CLASSES</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a general discussion of rule classes and
how they are used to build rules from formulas.  An example
<code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> formula from which a <code>:generalize</code> rule might be built is:

<pre>
Example:
any theorem
<p>
General Form:
any theorem
</pre>

To use such a <code>:generalize</code> rule, the system waits until it has
decided to generalize some term, <code>term</code>, by replacing it with some new
variable <code>v</code>.  If any <code>:generalize</code> formula can be instantiated so that
some non-variable subterm becomes <code>term</code>, then that instance of the
formula is added as a hypothesis.<p>

At the moment, the best description of how ACL2 <code>:generalize</code> rules
are used may be found in the discussion of ``Generalize Rules,'' page
248 of A Computational Logic Handbook, or ``Generalization,'' page
132 of ``Computer-Aided Reasoning: An Approach.''
