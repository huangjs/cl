<h3>GUARD-EVALUATION-TABLE</h3>a table that shows combinations of <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>s and <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>-checking
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="GUARD.html">GUARD</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> for an introduction to the topic discussed here.  Also
see <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> for a general discussion of guards, and
see <a href="GUARD-EVALUATION-EXAMPLES-SCRIPT.html">guard-evaluation-examples-script</a> for a script that illustrates
combinations presented below.<p>

The table below illustrates the interaction of the <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> with the
value supplied to <code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code>.  The first row considers
functions defined in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode; the other two consider
functions defined in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode.  The columns correspond to four
values of state global <code>'guard-checking-on</code>, as supplied to
<code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code>.  (A fifth value, <code>:nowarn</code>, is similar to <code>t</code>
but suppresses warnings encountered with <code>t</code> (as explained in those warning
messages), and is not considered here.)  During proofs,
<code>'guard-checking-on</code> is set to <code>nil</code> regardless of how this variable has
been set in the top-level loop.<p>

Below this table, we make some comments about its entries, ordered by row and
then by column.  For example, when we refer to ``b2'' we are discussing the
execution of a <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode function whose guards have not been
verified, after having executed <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code><code> :all</code>.<p>


<pre>
   guard-checking-on:  (1)t      (2):all   (3):none   (4)nil<p>

 (a) :program             a1        a2        a3        a4
 (b) guards not verified  b1        b2        b3        b4
 (c) guards verified      c1        c2        c3        c4
</pre>
<p>

a1. Check the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> upon entry, then use the raw Lisp code if the guard
checks (else cause an error).  This is a common setting when one wants a
little guard checking but also wants the efficiency of raw Lisp.  But note
that you can get raw Lisp errors.  For example, if you make the definition
<code>(defun foo (x) (car x))</code> in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode and execute
<code>:</code><code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code><code> t</code>, and then execute <code>(foo 3)</code>, you will
likely get an error from the call <code>(car 3)</code> made in raw Lisp.<p>

a2. For built-in (predefined) functions, see a1 instead.  Otherwise:<br>

Check the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, without exception.  Thus, we never run the raw Lisp
code in this case.  This can be useful when testing <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode
functions, but you may want to run <code>:</code><code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code><code> t</code> or at least
<code>:</code><code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code><code> :exec</code> in this case, so that the execution is done using
compiled code.<p>

a3. For built-in (predefined) functions, see a4 instead.  Otherwise:<br>

Do not check the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>.  For <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode functions, we never
run the raw Lisp code in this case; so if you care about efficiency, see the
comment in a2 above about <code>:</code><code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code>.  This combination is useful if you
are using ACL2 as a programming language and do not want to prove theorems
about your functions or suffer <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> violations.  In this case, you can
forget about any connection between ACL2 and Common Lisp.<p>

a4. Run the raw Lisp code without checking <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s at all.  Thus, for
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode functions, the <code>nil</code> setting is often preferable to
the <code>:none</code> setting because you get the efficiency of raw Lisp execution.
However, with <code>nil</code> you can therefore get hard Lisp errors as in a1 above.<p>

b1. Guards are checked at the top-level, though not at self-recursive calls.
We never run the raw Lisp code in this case; guards would need to be verified
first.<p>

b2. Unlike the <code>t</code> setting, guards are checked even on self-recursive
calls.  But like the <code>t</code> setting, we do not run the raw Lisp code.  Use
this setting if you want guards checked on each recursive call in spite of
the cost of doing so.<p>

b3, b4. Execution avoids the raw Lisp code and never checks guards.  The
<code>nil</code> and <code>:none</code> settings behave the same in this case (i.e., for
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode functions whose guards have not been verified).<p>

c1, c2. Guards are checked.  If the checks pass, evaluation takes place using
the raw Lisp code.  If the checks fail, we get a guard violation.  Either
way, we do not execute ``in the logic''; we only execute using the raw Lisp
code.  Note that <code>t</code> and <code>:all</code> behave the same in this case, (i.e. for
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode functions whose <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s have been verified).<p>

c3, c4. For the <code>:none</code> and <code>nil</code> settings, <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode
functions whose guards have been verified will never cause guard violations.
However, with <code>nil</code>, guards are still checked: if the check succeeds, then
evaluation is done using the raw Lisp code, and if not, it is done by the
``logic'' code, including self-recursive calls (though unlike the <code>t</code> case,
we will not see a warning about this).  But with <code>:none</code>, no guard checking
is done, so the only time the raw Lisp code will be executed is when the
guard is <code>t</code> (so that no evaluation is necessary).  Thus, if you use
<code>:none</code> and you want a function <code>(foo x)</code> with guard <code>(g x)</code> to execute
using raw Lisp code, you can write a ``wrapper'' function with a guard of
<code>t</code>:

<pre>
(defun foo-wrap (x)
  (if (g x)
      (foo x)
    'do-not-case))
</pre>

If you want the speed of executing raw Lisp code and you have non-trivial
guards on functions that you want to call at the top-level, use <code>nil</code>
rather than <code>:none</code>.<p>
