<h2>Guessing the Type of a Newly Admitted Function</h2>
<p>
When a function is admitted to the logic, ACL2 tries to ``guess''
what type of object it returns.  This guess is codified as a term
that expresses a property of the value of the function.  For <code>app</code>
the term is

<pre>
(OR (CONSP (APP X Y))
    (EQUAL (APP X Y) Y))
</pre>

which says that <code>app</code> returns either a cons or its second argument.
This formula is added to ACL2's rule base as a <code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code>
<a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> rule.  Later we will discuss how rules are used by the ACL2
theorem prover.  The point here is just that when you add a definition,
the data base of rules is updated, not just by the addition of the
definitional axiom, but by several new rules.<p>
