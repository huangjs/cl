<h3>HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE</h3>handling <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that are <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>

This documentation topic explains a little bit about certain errors users may
see when attempting to evaluate a <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> event.  In brief, if you see
an error that refers you to this topic, you are probably trying to admit a
<code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> event, and you should change the name of the package to be
introduced by that event.<p>

Recall that <code>defpkg</code> events introduce axioms, for example as follows.

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(defpkg "PKG0" '(a b))<p>

Now, a <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> event may be executed underneath an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> form that is marked <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>.  In that case, traces of
the added axiom will disappear after the surrounding <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> form is admitted.  This can cause inconsistencies.  (You
can take our word for it, or you can look at the example shown in the
``Essay on Hidden Packages'' in source file <code>axioms.lisp</code>.)<p>

In order to prevent unsoundness, then, ACL2 maintains the following
invariant.  Let us say that a <code>defpkg</code> event is ``hidden'' if it is in
support of the current logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> but is not present in that world as
an event, because it is <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> as indicated above.  We maintain the
invariant that all <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, even if ``hidden'', are tracked
under-the-hood in the current logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Sometimes this property
causes <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> events to be written to the <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of a book's
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> (see <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>).  At any rate, if you then try to define the
package in a manner inconsistent with the earlier such definition, that is,
with a different imports list, you will see an error because of the
above-mentioned tracking.<p>

(By the way, this topic's name comes from Holly Bell, who heard
"hidden death package" instead of "hidden defpkg".  The description
seemed to fit.  Thanks, Holly!)
