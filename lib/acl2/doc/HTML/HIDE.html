<h2>HIDE</h2>hide a term from the rewriter
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

<code>Hide</code> is actually the <a href="IDENTITY.html">identity</a> function:  <code>(hide x) = x</code> for
all <code>x</code>.  However, terms of the form <code>(hide x)</code> are ignored by the
ACL2 rewriter, except when explicit <code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> are given
for such terms (see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>) or when rewrite rules explicitly
about <code>hide</code> are available.  An <code>:expand</code> hint that removes all
calls of <code>hide</code> is:

<pre>
:expand ((:free (x) (hide x)))
</pre>

The above hint can be particularly useful when ACL2's equality heuristics
apply <code>hide</code> to an equality after substituting it into the rest of the
goal, if that goal (or a subgoal of it) fails to be proved.<p>

<code>Hide</code> terms are also ignored by the induction heuristics.
<p>
Sometimes the ACL2 simplifier inserts <code>hide</code> terms into a proof
attempt out of the blue, as it were.  Why and what can you do about
it?  Suppose you have a constrained function, say <code>constrained-fn</code>, and
you define another function, say <code>another-fn</code>, in terms of it, as in:

<pre>
(defun another-fn (x y z)
  (if (big-hairy-test x y z)
      (constrained-fn x y z)
      t))
</pre>

Suppose the term <code>(another-fn 'a 'b 'c)</code> arises in a proof.  Since
the arguments are all constants, ACL2 will try to reduce such a term
to a constant by executing the definition of <code>another-fn</code>.
However, after a possibly extensive computation (because of
<code>big-hairy-test</code>) the execution fails because of the unevaluable
call of <code>constrained-fn</code>.  To avoid subsequent attempts to evaluate
the term, ACL2 embeds it in a <code>hide</code> expression, i.e., rewrites it
to <code>(hide (another-fn 'a 'b 'c))</code>.<p>

You might think this rarely occurs since all the arguments of
<code>another-fn</code> must be constants.  You would be right except for one
special case:  if <code>another-fn</code> takes no arguments, i.e., is a
constant function, then every call of it fits this case.  Thus, if
you define a function of no arguments in terms of a constrained
function, you will often see <code>(another-fn)</code> rewrite to
<code>(hide (another-fn))</code>.<p>

We do not hide the term if the executable counterpart of the
function is disabled -- because we do not try to evaluate it in the
first place.  Thus, to prevent the insertion of a <code>hide</code> term into
the proof attempt, you can globally disable the executable
counterpart of the offending defined function, e.g.,

<pre>
(in-theory (disable (:executable-counterpart another-fn))).
</pre>
<p>

It is conceivable that you cannot afford to do this:  perhaps some
calls of the offending function must be computed while others cannot
be.  One way to handle this situation is to leave the executable
counterpart enabled, so that <code>hide</code> terms are introduced on the
calls that cannot be computed, but prove explicit :<code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>
rules for each of those <code>hide</code> terms.  For example, suppose that in
the proof of some theorem, thm, it is necessary to leave the
executable counterpart of <code>another-fn</code> enabled but that the call
<code>(another-fn 1 2 3)</code> arises in the proof and cannot be computed.
Thus the proof attempt will introduce the term
<code>(hide (another-fn 1 2 3))</code>.  Suppose that you can show that
<code>(another-fn 1 2 3)</code> is <code>(contrained-fn 1 2 3)</code> and that such
a step is necessary to the proof.  Unfortunately, proving the rewrite
rule

<pre>
(defthm thm-helper
  (equal (another-fn 1 2 3) (constrained-fn 1 2 3)))
</pre>

would not help the proof of thm because the target term is hidden
inside the <code>hide</code>.  However,

<pre>
(defthm thm-helper
  (equal (hide (another-fn 1 2 3)) (constrained-fn 1 2 3)))
</pre>

would be applied in the proof of thm and is the rule you should 
prove.<p>

Now to prove <code>thm-helper</code> you need to use the two ``tricks'' which
have already been discussed.  First, to eliminate the <code>hide</code> term
in the proof of <code>thm-helper</code> you should include the hint
<code>:expand</code> <code>(hide (another-fn 1 2 3))</code>.  Second, to prevent the
<code>hide</code> term from being reintroduced when the system tries and fails
to evaluate <code>(another-fn 1 2 3)</code> you should include the hint
<code>:in-theory</code> <code>(disable (:executable-counterpart another-fn))</code>.
Thus, <code>thm-helper</code> will actually be:

<pre>
(defthm thm-helper
  (equal (hide (another-fn 1 2 3)) (constrained-fn 1 2 3))
  :hints
  (("Goal" :expand (hide (another-fn 1 2 3))
           :in-theory (disable (:executable-counterpart another-fn)))))
</pre>

terms.
