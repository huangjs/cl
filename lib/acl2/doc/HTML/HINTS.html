Examples:
The following :hints value is nonsensical.  Nevertheless, it
illustrates all of the available hint keywords:<p>

:hints (("Goal"
         :do-not-induct t
         :do-not '(generalize fertilize)
         :expand ((assoc x a) 
                  :lambdas
                  (:free (y) (:with member (member y z))))
         :restrict ((&lt;-trans ((x x) (y (foo x)))))
         :hands-off (length binary-append)
         :in-theory (set-difference-theories
                      (current-theory :here)
                      '(assoc))
         :induct (and (nth n a) (nth n b))
         :use ((:instance assoc-of-append
                          (x a) (y b) (z c))
               (:functional-instance
                 (:instance p-f (x a) (y b))
                 (p consp)
                 (f assoc)))
         :bdd (:vars (c a0 b0 a1 b1) :prove nil :bdd-constructors (cons))
         :cases ((true-listp a) (consp a))
         :by (:instance rev-rev (x (cdr z)))
         :nonlinearp t))
</pre>

A very common hint is the <code>:use</code> hint, which in general takes as its
value a list of ``lemma instances'' (see <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>) but
which allows a single lemma name as a special case:

<pre>
:hints (("[1]Subgoal *1/1.2'" :use lemma23))
</pre>
<p>

ACL2 also provides ``computed hints'' for the advanced user.
See <a href="COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>
<p>
Background: <code>Hints</code> are allowed in all <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that use the theorem
prover.  During <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> there are two different uses of the
theorem prover: one to prove termination and another to verify the
<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s.  To pass a hint to the theorem prover during termination
proofs, use the <code>:hints</code> keyword in the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>'s <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code> declaration.  To
pass a hint to the theorem prover during the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> verification of
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>, use the <code>:guard-hints</code> keyword in the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>'s <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code>
declaration.  The <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code> event and the <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event also use
the theorem prover.  To pass hints to them, use the <code>:hints</code> keyword
argument to the event.

<pre>
General Form of Common :hints:
  ((goal-spec :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)
   ...
   (goal-spec :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn))
</pre>

where <code><a href="GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a></code> is as described in the documentation for
<a href="GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a> and the keys and their respective values are shown
below with their interpretations.  (We also provide ``computed hints''
but discuss them separately; see <a href="COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>.)<p>

<code>:DO-NOT-INDUCT</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is <code>t</code>, <code>name</code> or <code>nil</code>, indicating whether <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> is permitted
under the specified goal.  If <code>value</code> is <code>t</code>, then the attempt to apply
<a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> to the indicated goal or any subgoal under the indicated
goal will immediately cause the theorem prover to report <a href="FAILURE.html">failure</a>.
Thus, the indicated goal must be proved entirely by simplification,
destructor elimination, and the other ``waterfall'' processes.
<a href="INDUCTION.html">Induction</a> to prove the indicated goal (or any subgoal) is not
permitted.  See however the <code>:induct</code> hint below.  If <code>value</code> is a
symbol other than <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>, the theorem prover will give a
``bye'' to any subgoal that would otherwise be attacked with
induction.  This will cause the theorem prover to fail eventually
but will collect the necessary subgoals.  If <code>value</code> is <code>nil</code>, this
hint means <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> is permitted.  Since that is the default,
there is no reason to use the value <code>nil</code>.<p>

<code>:DO-NOT</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a term having at most the single free variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>, which
when evaluated (with <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> bound to the current ACL2 logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>)
produces a list of symbols that is a subset of the list

<pre>
(preprocess ;propositional logic, simple rules
 simplify   ;as above plus rewriting, linear arithmetic
 eliminate-destructors
 fertilize  ;use of equalities
 generalize
 eliminate-irrelevance).
</pre>

The hint indicates that the ``processes'' named should not be used
at or below the goal in question.  Thus, to prevent generalization
and fertilization, say, include the hint

<pre>
:do-not '(generalize fertilize)
</pre>

If <code>value</code> is a single symbol, as in

<pre>
:do-not generalize,
</pre>

it is taken to be <code>'(value)</code>.<p>

<code>:EXPAND</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a true list of terms, each of which is of one of the forms
<code>(let ((v1 t1)...) b)</code> or <code>(fn t1 ... tn)</code>, where <code>fn</code> is a defined
function symbol with formals <code>v1, ..., vn,</code> and <code>body</code> <code>b</code>.  Such a
term is said to be ``expandable:'' it can be replaced by the result of
substituting the <code>ti</code>'s for the <code>vi</code>'s in <code>b</code>.  The terms listed in the
<code>:expand</code> hint are expanded when they are encountered by the simplifier
while working on the specified goal or any of its subgoals.  We permit
<code>value</code> to be a single such term instead of a singleton list.  <strong>Notes</strong>:
(1) Allowed are ``terms'' of the form
<code>(:free (var1 var2 ...  varn) pattern)</code> where the indicated variables are
distinct and <code>pattern</code> is a term.  Such ``terms'' indicate that we consider
the indicated variables to be instantiatable, in the following sense:
whenever the simplifier encounters a term that can be obtained from
<code>pattern</code> by instantiating the variables <code>(var1 var2 ...  varn)</code>, then it
expands that term.  (2) Also allowed are ``terms'' of the form
<code>(:with name term)</code>, where <code>name</code> is a function symbol, a macro name that
denotes a function symbol (see <a href="MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>), or a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.  The
corresponding rule of class <code>:rewrite</code>, which is often a <a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a>
rule but need not be, is then used in place of the current body for the
function symbol of <code>term</code>; see <a href="SHOW-BODIES.html">show-bodies</a> and see <a href="SET-BODY.html">set-body</a>.  If the rule
is of the form <code>(implies hyp (equiv lhs rhs))</code>, then after matching <code>lhs</code>
to the current term in a context that is maintaining equivalence relation
<code>equiv</code>, ACL2 will replace the current term with
<code>(if hyp rhs (hide term))</code>, or just <code>rhs</code> if the rule is just
<code>(equal lhs rhs)</code>.  (3) A combination of both <code>:free</code> and <code>:with</code>, as
described above, is legal.  (4) The term <code>:LAMBDAS</code> is treated specially.
It denotes the list of all lambda applications (i.e., <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code> expressions)
encountered during the proof.  Conceptually, this use of <code>:LAMBDAS</code> tells
ACL2 to treat lambda applications as a notation for substitutions, rather
than as function calls whose opening is subject to the ACL2 rewriter's
heuristics (specifically, not allowing lambda applications to open when they
introduce ``too many'' if terms).<p>

<code>:HANDS-OFF</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a true list of function symbols or lambda expressions,
indicating that under the specified goal applications of these
functions are not to be rewritten.  <code>Value</code> may also be a single
function symbol or lambda expression instead of a list.<p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">IN-THEORY</a></code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a ``theory expression,'' i.e., a term having at most the
single free variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> which when evaluated (with <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> bound to
the current ACL2 logical world (see <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>)) will produce a
theory to use as the current theory for the goal specified.
See <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>.<p>

Note that an <code>:</code><code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">IN-THEORY</a></code> hint will always be evaluated relative to
the current ACL2 logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, not relative to the theory of a previous
goal.  Consider the following example.

<pre>
(defthm prop
  (p (f (g x)))
  :hints (("Goal"      :in-theory (disable f))
          ("Subgoal 3" :in-theory (enable  g))))
</pre>

Consider in particular the theory in effect at <code>Subgoal 3</code>.  This
call of the <code><a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a></code> macro enables <code>g</code> relative to the
<code><a href="CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a></code> of the current logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, <em>not</em> relative to
the theory produced by the hint at <code>Goal</code>.  Thus, the <code><a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a></code> of
<code>f</code> on behalf of the hint at <code>Goal</code> will be lost at <code>Subgoal 3</code>, and
<code>f</code> will be enabled at <code>Subgoal 3</code> if was enabled globally when <code>prop</code>
was submitted.<p>

<code>:INDUCT</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is either <code>t</code> or a term containing at least one recursively
defined function symbol.  If <code>t</code>, this hint indicates that the system
should proceed to apply its <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> heuristic to the specified goal
(without trying simplification, etc.).  If <code>value</code> is of the form
<code>(f x1 ... xk)</code>, where <code>f</code> is a recursively defined function and <code>x1</code>
through <code>xk</code> are distinct variables, then the system is to induct according
to the <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> scheme that was stored for <code>f</code>.  For example, for the
hint <code>:induct (true-listp x)</code>, ACL2 will assume that the goal holds for
<code>(cdr x)</code> when proving the induction step because <code><a href="TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></code> recurs
on the <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code>.  More generally, if <code>value</code> is a term other than <code>t</code>,
then not only should the system apply induction immediately, but it should
analyze <code>value</code> rather than the goal to generate its <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> scheme.
Merging and the other <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> heuristics are applied.  Thus, if
<code>value</code> contains several mergeable <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a>s, the ``best'' will be
created and chosen.  E.g., the <code>:induct</code> hint

<pre>
 (and (nth i a) (nth j a))
</pre>

suggests simultaneous <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> on <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>a</code>.<p>

If both an <code>:induct</code> and a <code>:do-not-induct</code> hint are supplied for a
given goal then the indicated <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> is applied to the goal and
the <code>:do-not-induct</code> hint is inherited by all subgoals generated.<p>

<code>:USE</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a> or a true list of <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>s,
indicating that the propositions denoted by the instances be added
as hypotheses to the specified goal.  See <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>.  Note
that <code>:use</code> makes the given instances available as ordinary hypotheses
of the formula to be proved.  The <code>:instance</code> form of a <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>
permits you to instantiate the free variables of previously proved
theorems any way you wish; but it is up to you to provide the
appropriate instantiations because once the instances are added as
hypotheses their variables are no longer instantiable.  These new
hypotheses participate fully in all subsequent rewriting, etc.  If
the goal in question is in fact an instance of a previously proved
theorem, you may wish to use <code>:by</code> below.  Note that <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> may be
helpful when employing <code>:use</code> hints; see <a href="MINIMAL-THEORY.html">minimal-theory</a>.<p>

<code>:</code><a href="BDD.html">BDD</a><br>

This hint indicates that ordered binary decision diagrams (BDDs)
with rewriting are to be used to prove or simplify the goal.
See <a href="BDD.html">bdd</a> for an introduction to the ACL2 BDD algorithm.<p>

<code>Value</code> is a list of even length, such that every other element,
starting with the first, is one of the keywords <code>:vars</code>,
<code>:bdd-constructors</code>, <code>:prove</code>, or <code>:literal</code>.  Each keyword that
is supplied should be followed by a value of the appropriate form,
as shown below; for others, a default is used.  Although <code>:vars</code>
must always be supplied, we expect that most users will be content
with the defaults used for the other values.<p>

<code>:vars</code> -- A list of ACL2 variables, which are to be treated as
Boolean variables.  The prover must be able to check, using trivial
reasoning (see <a href="TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>), that each of these variables is
Boolean in the context of the current goal.  Note that the prover
will use very simple heuristics to order any variables that do not
occur in <code>:vars</code> (so that they are ``greater than'' the variables
that do occur in <code>:vars</code>), and these heuristics are often far from
optimal.  In addition, any variables not listed may fail to be
assumed Boolean by the prover, which is likely to seriously impede
the effectiveness of ACL2's BDD algorithm.  Thus, users are
encouraged <em>not</em> to rely on the default order, but to supply a
list of variables instead.  Finally, it is allowed to use a value of
<code>t</code> for <code>vars</code>.  This means the same as a <code>nil</code> value, except
that the BDD algorithm is directed to fail unless it can guarantee
that all variables in the input term are known to be Boolean (in a
sense discussed elsewhere; see <a href="BDD-ALGORITHM.html">bdd-algorithm</a>).<p>

<code>:literal</code> -- An indication of which part of the current goal
should receive BDD processing.  Possible values are:

<pre>
  :all     treat entire goal as a single literal (the default)
  :conc    process the conclusion
  n        process the hypothesis with index n (1, 2, ...)
</pre>
<p>

<code>:bdd-constructors</code> -- When supplied, this value should be a
list of function symbols in the current ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>; it is
<code>(cons)</code> by default, unless <code>:bdd-constructors</code> has a value in
the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> by default, in which case that value is
the default.  We expect that most users will be content with the
default.  See <a href="BDD-ALGORITHM.html">bdd-algorithm</a> for information about how this
value is used.<p>

<code>:prove</code> -- When supplied, this value should be <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>; it
is <code>t</code> by default.  When the goal is not proved and this value is
<code>t</code>, the entire proof will abort.  Use the value <code>nil</code> if you are
happy to the proof to go on with the simplified term.<p>

<code>:CASES</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a non-empty list of terms.  For each term in the list, a
new goal is created from the current goal by assuming that term; and
also, in essence, one additional new goal is created by assuming all
the terms in the list false.  We say ``in essence'' because if the
disjunction of the terms supplied is a tautology, then that final
goal will be a tautology and hence will in fact never actually be
created.<p>

<code>:BY</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is a <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>, <code>nil</code>, or a new event name. If the
value is a <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a> (see <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>), then it indicates that
the goal (when viewed as a clause) is either equal to the proposition denoted
by the instance, or is subsumed by that proposition when both are viewed as
clauses.  To view a formula as a clause, union together the negations of the
hypotheses and add the conclusion.  For example,

<pre>
(IMPLIES (AND (h1 t1) (h2 t2)) (c t1))
</pre>

may be viewed as the clause

<pre>
{~(h1 t1) ~(h2 t2) (c t1)}.
</pre>

Clause <code>c1</code> is ``subsumed'' by clause <code>c2</code> iff some instance of <code>c2</code> is a
subset of <code>c1</code>.  For example, the clause above is subsumed by
<code>{~(h1 x) (c x)}</code>, which when viewed as a formula is
<code>(implies (h1 x) (c x))</code>.<p>

If the value is <code>nil</code> or a new name, the prover does not even
attempt to prove the goal to which this hint is attached.  Instead
the goal is given a ``bye'', i.e., it is skipped and the proof
attempt continues as though the goal had been proved.  If the prover
terminates without error then it reports that the proof would have
succeeded had the indicated goals been proved and it prints an
appropriate <a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> form to define each of the <code>:by</code> names.  The
``name'' <code>nil</code> means ``make up a name.''<p>

The system does not attempt to check the uniqueness of the <code>:by</code> names
(supplied or made up), since by the time those goals are proved the
namespace will be cluttered still further.  Therefore, the final
list of ``appropriate'' <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> forms may be impossible to admit
without some renaming by the user.  If you must invent new names,
remember to substitute the new ones for the old ones in the <code>:by</code>
hints themselves.<p>

<code>:RESTRICT</code><br>

Warning: This is a sophisticated hint, suggested by Bishop Brock, that is
intended for advanced users.  In particular, <code>:restrict</code> hints are ignored
by the preprocessor, so you might find it useful to give the hint
<code>:do-not '(preprocess)</code> when using any <code>:restrict</code> hints, at least if the
rules in question are abbreviations (see <a href="SIMPLE.html">simple</a>).<p>

<code>Value</code> is an association list.  Its members are of the form
<code>(x subst1 subst2 ...)</code>, where: <code>x</code> is either (1) a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> whose
<code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> is <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> or (2) an event name
corresponding to one or more such <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s; and <code>(subst1 subst2 ...)</code> is
a non-empty list of substitutions, i.e., of association lists pairing
variables with terms.  First consider the case that <code>x</code> is a
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.  Recall that without
this hint, the rule named <code>x</code> is used by matching its left-hand side (call
it <code>lhs</code>) against the term currently being considered by the rewriter, that
is, by attempting to find a substitution <code>s</code> such that the instantiation of
<code>lhs</code> using <code>s</code> is equal to that term.  If however the <code>:restrict</code> hint
contains <code>(x subst1 subst2 ...)</code>, then this behavior will be modified by
restricting <code>s</code> so that it must extend <code>subst1</code>; and if there is no such
<code>s</code>, then <code>s</code> is restricted so that it must extend <code>subst2</code>; and so on,
until the list of substitutions is exhausted.  If no such <code>s</code> is found,
then the rewrite or definition rule named <code>x</code> is not applied to that term.
Finally, if <code>x</code> is an event name corresponding to one or more
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s (that is, <code>x</code> is the
``base symbol'' of such <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s; see <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>), say <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s <code>r1</code>,
... <code>rn</code>, then the meaning is the same except that
<code>(x subst1 subst2 ...)</code> is replaced by <code>(ri subst1 subst2 ...)</code> for each
<code>i</code>.  Once this replacement is complete, the hint may not contain two
members whose <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> is the same <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.<p>

Note that the substitutions in <code>:restrict</code> hints refer to the
variables actually appearing in the goals, not to the variables
appearing in the rule being restricted.<p>

Here is an example, supplied by Bishop Brock.  Suppose that the
database includes the following rewrite rule, which is probably kept
<a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.  (We ignore the question of how to prove this rule.)

<pre>
cancel-&lt;-*$free:
(implies (and (rationalp x)
              (rationalp y)
              (rationalp z))
         (equal (&lt; y z)
                (if (&lt; x 0)
                    (&gt; (* x y) (* x z))
                  (if (&gt; x 0)
                      (&lt; (* x y) (* x z))
                    (hide (&lt; y z))))))
</pre>

Then ACL2 can prove the following theorem (unless other rules get in
the way), essentially by multiplying both sides by <code>x</code>.

<pre>
(thm
  (implies (and (rationalp x)
                (&lt; 1 x))
           (&lt; (/ x) 1))
  :hints
  (("Goal"
    :in-theory (enable cancel-&lt;-*$free)
    :restrict ((cancel-&lt;-*$free ((x x) (y (/ x)) (z 1)))))))
</pre>

The <code>:restrict</code> hint above says that the variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> in the
rewrite rule <code>cancel-&lt;-*$free</code> above should be instantiated
respectively by <code>x</code>, <code>(/ x)</code>, and <code>1</code>.  Thus <code>(&lt; y z)</code> becomes <code>(&lt; (/ x) 1)</code>,
and this inequality is replaced by the corresponding instance of the
right-hand-side of <code>cancel-&lt;-*$free</code>.  Since the current conjecture
assumes <code>(&lt; 1 x)</code>, that instance of the right-hand side simplifies to

<pre>
(&lt; (* x (/ x)) (* x 1))
</pre>

which in turn simplifies to <code>(&lt; 1 x)</code>, a hypothesis in the present
theorem.<p>

<code>:NONLINEARP</code><br>

<code>Value</code> is <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>, indicating whether <a href="NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>
is active.  The default value is <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>.
