<h2>How Long Does It Take to Become an Effective User?</h2>
<p>
The training time depends primarily on the background of the user.<p>

We expect that a user who

<pre>
  * has a bachelor's degree in <b>computer science</B> or <b>mathematics</B>,<p>

  * has some experience with <b>formal methods</B>,<p>

  * has had some exposure to <b>Lisp</B> programming and is <b>comfortable</B> 
    with the Lisp <b>notation</B>,<p>

  * is <b>familiar</B> with and has <b>unlimited access</B> to a Common Lisp
    <b>host</B> processor, <b>operating system</B>, and <b>text editor</B> (we
    use Sun workstations running Unix and GNU Emacs),<p>

  * is willing to read and study the <b>ACL2 documentation</B>, and<p>

  * is given the opportunity to start with ``<b>toy</B>'' projects <b>before</B>
    being expected to tackle the company's Grand Challenge,
</pre>

will probably take <b>several months</B> to become an effective ACL2 user.<p>
