<h2>How To Find Out about ACL2 Functions (cont)</h2>
<p>
You can always use the Index <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> to find the documentation of
functions.  Try it.  Click on the Index icon below.  Then use the
Find command of your browser to find ``endp'' in that document and
follow the link.  But remember to come back here.<p>

The ACL2 documentation is also available via Emacs' TexInfo, allowing
you to explore the hyperlinked documentation in the comfort of a text
editor that can also interact with ACL2.<p>

In addition, runtime images of ACL2 have the hyperlinked text as a large ACL2
data structure that can be explored with ACL2's <b>:doc</B> command.  If you
have ACL2 running, try the command <b>:doc endp</B>.<p>

Another way to find out about ACL2 functions, if you have an ACL2
image available, is to use the command :<code><a href="ARGS.html">args</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> which
prints the formals, type, and guard of a function symbol.<p>

Of course, the ACL2 documentation can also be printed out as 700 page
book.  See the ACL2 Home Page to download the Postscript.<p>

Now let's continue with <code>app</code>.<p>
