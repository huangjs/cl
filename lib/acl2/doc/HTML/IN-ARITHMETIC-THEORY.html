<h2>IN-ARITHMETIC-THEORY</h2>designate ``current'' theory for some rewriting done in linear arithmetic
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
(in-arithmetic-theory '(lemma1 lemma2))
<p>
General Form:
(in-arithmetic-theory term :doc doc-string)
</pre>

where <code>term</code> is a term that when evaluated will produce a theory
(see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>), and <code><a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a></code> is an optional <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
string not beginning with ``<code>:doc-section</code> ...''.  Except for the
variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>, <code>term</code> must contain no free variables.  <code>Term</code> is
evaluated with the variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> bound to the current <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> to
obtain a theory and the corresponding runic theory
(see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>) is then made the current theory.  Thus,
immediately after the <code>in-arithmetic-theory</code>, a rule is <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d
iff its rule name is a member of the runic interpretation (see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>)
of some member of the value of <code>term</code>.<p>

Warning:  If <code>term</code> involves macros such as <code><a href="ENABLE.html">ENABLE</a></code> and <code><a href="DISABLE.html">DISABLE</a></code>
you will probably not get what you expect!  Those macros are defined
relative to the <code><a href="CURRENT-THEORY.html">CURRENT-THEORY</a></code>.  But in this context you might
wish they were defined in terms of the ``<code>CURRENT-ARITHMETIC-THEORY</code>''
which is not actually a defined function.  We do not anticipate that users
will repeatedly modify the arithmetic theory.  We expect <code>term</code> most often
to be a constant list of runes and so have not provided ``arithmetic theory
manipulation functions'' analogous to <code><a href="CURRENT-THEORY.html">CURRENT-THEORY</a></code> and <code><a href="ENABLE.html">ENABLE</a></code>.<p>

BECAUSE NO UNIQUE name is associated with an <code>in-arithmetic-theory</code> event,
there is no way we can store the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string <code><a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a></code>
in our il[documentation] data base.  Hence, we actually prohibit <code><a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a></code>
from having the form of an ACL2 <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string;
see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>.<p>
