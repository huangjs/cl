<pre>
Examples:
(include-book "my-arith")
(include-book "/home/smith/my-arith")
(include-book "/../../my-arith")<p>

General Form:
(include-book file :load-compiled-file action  ; [default :warn]
                   :uncertified-okp t/nil      ; [default t]
                   :defaxioms-okp t/nil        ; [default t]
                   :skip-proofs-okp t/nil      ; [default t]
                   :ttags ttags                ; [default nil]
                   :dir directory
                   :doc doc-string)
</pre>

where <code>file</code> is a book name.  See <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> for general information,
see <a href="BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a> for information about book names, and see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a> for
information about file names.  <code>Action</code> is one of <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code>, <code>:warn</code>
(the default), <code>:try</code>, <code>:comp</code>, or <code>:comp!</code>; these values are explained
below.  The three <code>-okp</code> keyword arguments, which default to <code>t</code>,
determine whether errors or warnings are generated under certain conditions
explained below; when the argument is <code>t</code>, warnings are generated.  The
<code>dir</code> argument, if supplied, is a keyword that represents an absolute
pathname for a directory (see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>), to be used instead of the current
book directory (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>) for resolving the given <code>file</code> argument to an
absolute pathname.  In particular, <code>:dir :system</code> resolves <code>file</code> using
the distributed <code>books/</code> directory of your ACL2 installation, unless your
ACL2 executable was built somewhere other than where it currently resides;
please see the ``Distributed Books Directory'' below.  To define other
keywords that can be used for <code>dir</code>, see <a href="ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a>.
<code>Doc-string</code> is an optional <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string; see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>.  If
the book has no <code><a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a></code>, if its <code><a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a></code> is invalid or if
the certificate was produced by a different <a href="VERSION.html">version</a> of ACL2, a warning
is printed and the book is included anyway; see <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>.  This can lead
to serious errors; see <a href="UNCERTIFIED-BOOKS.html">uncertified-books</a>.  If the portcullis of the
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> (see <a href="PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>) cannot be raised in the host logical
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, an error is caused and no change occurs to the logic.  Otherwise,
the non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in file are assumed.  Then the <a href="KEEP.html">keep</a> of
the <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> is checked to ensure that the correct files were read;
see <a href="KEEP.html">keep</a>.  A warning is printed if uncertified <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> were included.
Even if no warning is printed, <code>include-book</code> places a burden on you;
see <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>.<p>

If there is a compiled file for the book that was created more recently than
the book itself and the value <code>action</code> of the <code>:load-compiled-file</code>
argument is not <code>nil</code>, or is omitted, then the compiled file is
automatically loaded; otherwise it is not loaded.  If <code>action</code> is <code>t</code>
then the compiled file must be loaded or an error will occur; if <code>action</code>
is <code>:warn</code> (the default) then a warning will be printed; if <code>action</code> is
<code>:try</code> then no warning will be printed; and if <code>action</code> is <code>:comp</code> then
the file will be immediately compiled (if the compiled file does not already
exist) and loaded.  The <code>action</code> <code>:comp!</code> is handled just like <code>:comp</code>,
with two exceptions: compilation always takes place because the old compiled
file is first deleted, and executable counterparts are also compiled (in
analogy to value <code>:all</code> for the <code>compile-flg</code> argument of
<code>certify-book</code>; see <a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>).  <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></code> can also be used to
compile a book; thus, <code>:comp</code> and <code>:comp!</code> do the same sort of
compilation as <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> when the latter is given a <code>compile-flg</code>
of <code>t</code> or <code>:all</code>, respectively.  An effect of <a href="COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> is to
speed up the execution of the functions defined within the book when those
functions are applied to specific values.  Compilation can also remove tail
recursion, thus avoiding stack overflows.  The presence of compiled code for
the functions in the book should not otherwise affect the performance of
ACL2.  See <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> for a discussion.  NOTE: the <code>:load-compiled-file</code>
argument is not recursive; that is, calls of <code>include-book</code> that are inside
the book supplied to <code>include-book</code> will use their own
<code>:load-compiled-file</code> arguments (default <code>:warn</code>), not the
<code>:load-compiled-file</code> argument for the enclosing book.<p>

The three <code>-okp</code> arguments, <code>:uncertified-okp</code>, <code>defaxioms-okp</code>,
and <code>skip-proofs-okp</code>, determine the system's behavior when
the book or any subbook is found to be uncertified, when the book
or any subbook is found to contain <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> events, and when
the book or any subbook is found to contain <code><a href="SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></code> events,
respectively.  All three default to <code>t</code>, which means it is ``ok''
for the condition to arise.  In this case, a warning is printed but
the processing to load the book is allowed to proceed.  When one of
these arguments is <code>nil</code> and the corresponding condition arises,
an error is signaled and processing is aborted.  <strong>Exception</strong>:
<code>:uncertified-okp</code> is ignored if the <code>include-book</code> is being
performed on behalf of a <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>.<p>

The keyword argument <code>:ttags</code> may normally be omitted.  A few constructs,
used for example if you are building your own system based on ACL2, may
require it.  See <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> for an explanation of this argument.<p>

<code>Include-book</code> is similar in spirit to <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> in that it is
a single event that ``contains'' other <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, in this case the
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> listed in the file named.  <code>Include-book</code> processes the
non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> event forms in the file, assuming that each is
admissible.  <code><a href="LOCAL.html">Local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in the file are ignored.  You may
use <code>include-book</code> to load several <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>, creating the logical
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> that contains the definitions and theorems of all of
them.<p>

If any non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> event of the book attempts to define a <a href="NAME.html">name</a>
that has already been defined -- and the book's definition is not
syntactically identical to the existing definition -- the attempt to
include the book fails, an error message is printed, and no change
to the logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> occurs.  See <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a> for the
details.<p>

When a book is included, the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>
(see <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>) for the first event is always
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>.  That is, the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> ``outside'' the book --
in the environment in which <code>include-book</code> was called -- is
irrelevant to the book.  <a href="EVENTS.html">Events</a> that change the <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> are
permitted within a book (provided they are not in <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> forms).
However, such changes within a book are not exported, i.e., at the
conclusion of an <code>include-book</code>, the ``outside'' default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>
is always the same as it was before the <code>include-book</code>.<p>

Unlike every other event in ACL2, <code>include-book</code> puts a burden on
you.  Used improperly, <code>include-book</code> can be unsound in the sense
that it can create an inconsistent extension of a consistent logical
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  A certification mechanism is available to help you
carry this burden -- but it must be understood up front that even
certification is no guarantee against inconsistency here.  The
fundamental problem is one of file system security.
See <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for a discussion of the security issues.<p>

After execution of an <code>include-book</code> form, the value of
<code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> is restored to what it was immediately before
that <code>include-book</code> form was executed.
See <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.<p>

<b>Distributed Books Directory.</B>  We refer to the ``books directory'' of an
executable image as the full pathname string of the books directory
associated with <code>:dir :system</code> for that image.  This is where the
distributed books directory should reside.  By default, it is the <code>books/</code>
subdirectory of the directory where the sources reside and the executable
image is thus built.  If those books reside elsewhere, the environment
variable ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS can be set to the <code>books/</code> directory under which
they reside (a Unix-style pathname, typically ending in <code>books/</code> or
<code>books</code>, is permissible).  In most cases, your ACL2 executable is a small
script in which you can set this environment variable just above the line on
which the actual ACL2 image is invoked.<p>

This concludes the guided tour through <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.
See <a href="SET-COMPILE-FNS.html">set-compile-fns</a> for a subtle point about the interaction
between <code>include-book</code> and on-the-fly <a href="COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>.
See <a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> for a discussion of how to certify a book.
