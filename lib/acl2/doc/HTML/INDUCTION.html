Example:
(:induction :corollary t  ; the theorem proved is irrelevant!
            :pattern (* 1/2 i)
            :condition (and (integerp i) (&gt;= i 0))
            :scheme (recursion-by-sub2 i))
</pre>

In ACL2, as in Nqthm, the functions in a conjecture ``suggest'' the
inductions considered by the system.  Because every recursive
function must be admitted with a justification in terms of a measure
that decreases in a well-founded way on a given set of
``controlling'' arguments, every recursive function suggests a dual
induction scheme that ``unwinds'' the function from a given
application.<p>

For example, since <code><a href="APPEND.html">append</a></code> (actually <code><a href="BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></code>, but we'll ignore
the distinction here) decomposes its first argument by successive
<code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code>s as long as it is a non-<code>nil</code> true list, the induction scheme
suggested by <code>(append x y)</code> has a base case supposing <code>x</code> to be either
not a true list or to be <code>nil</code> and then has an induction step in which
the induction hypothesis is obtained by replacing <code>x</code> by <code>(cdr x)</code>.
This substitution decreases the same measure used to justify the
definition of <code><a href="APPEND.html">append</a></code>.  Observe that an induction scheme is suggested
by a recursive function application only if the controlling actuals
are distinct variables, a condition that is sufficient to ensure
that the ``substitution'' used to create the induction hypothesis is
indeed a substitution and that it drives down a certain measure.  In
particular, <code>(append (foo x) y)</code> does not suggest an induction
unwinding <code><a href="APPEND.html">append</a></code> because the induction scheme suggested by
<code>(append x y)</code> requires that we substitute <code>(cdr x)</code> for <code>x</code> and
we cannot do that if <code>x</code> is not a variable symbol.<p>

Once ACL2 has collected together all the suggested induction schemes
it massages them in various ways, combining some to simultaneously
unwind certain cliques of functions and vetoing others because they
``flaw'' others.  We do not further discuss the induction heuristics
here; the interested reader should see Chapter XIV of A
Computational Logic (Boyer and Moore, Academic Press, 1979) which
represents a fairly complete description of the induction heuristics
of ACL2.<p>

However, unlike Nqthm, ACL2 provides a means by which the user can
elaborate the rules under which function applications suggest
induction schemes.  Such rules are called <code>:induction</code> rules.  The
definitional principle automatically creates an <code>:induction</code> rule,
named <code>(:induction fn)</code>, for each admitted recursive function, <code>fn</code>.  It
is this rule that links applications of <code>fn</code> to the induction scheme
it suggests.  Disabling <code>(:induction fn)</code> will prevent <code>fn</code> from
suggesting the induction scheme derived from its recursive
definition.  It is possible for the user to create additional
<code>:induction</code> rules by using the <code>:induction</code> rule class in <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>.<p>

Technically we are ``overloading'' <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> by using it in the
creation of <code>:induction</code> rules because no theorem need be proved to
set up the heuristic link represented by an <code>:induction</code> rule.
However, since <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> is generally used to create rules and
rule-class objects are generally used to specify the exact form of
each rule, we maintain that convention and introduce the notion of
an <code>:induction</code> rule.  An <code>:induction</code> rule can be created from any
lemma whatsoever.

<pre>
General Form of an :induction Lemma or Corollary:
T<p>

General Form of an :induction rule-class:
(:induction :pattern pat-term
            :condition cond-term
            :scheme scheme-term)
</pre>

where <code>pat-term</code>, <code>cond-term</code>, and <code>scheme-term</code> are all terms, <code>pat-term</code>
is the application of a function symbol, <code>fn</code>, <code>scheme-term</code> is the
application of a function symbol, <code>rec-fn</code>, that suggests an
induction, and, finally, every free variable of <code>cond-term</code> and
<code>scheme-term</code> is a free variable of <code>pat-term</code>.  We actually check that
<code>rec-fn</code> is either recursively defined -- so that it suggests the
induction that is intrinsic to its recursion -- or else that another
<code>:induction</code> rule has been proved linking a call of <code>rec-fn</code> as the
<code>:pattern</code> to some scheme.<p>

The induction rule created is used as follows.  When an instance of
the <code>:pattern</code> term occurs in a conjecture to be proved by induction
and the corresponding instance of the <code>:condition</code> term is known to be
non-<code>nil</code> (by type reasoning alone), the corresponding instance of the
<code>:scheme</code> term is created and the rule ``suggests'' the induction, if
any, suggested by that term.  If <code>rec-fn</code> is recursive, then the
suggestion is the one that unwinds that recursion.<p>

Consider, for example, the example given above,

<pre>
(:induction :pattern (* 1/2 i)
            :condition (and (integerp i) (&gt;= i 0))
            :scheme (recursion-by-sub2 i)).
</pre>

In this example, we imagine that <code>recursion-by-sub2</code> is the
function:

<pre>
(defun recursion-by-sub2 (i)
  (if (and (integerp i)
           (&lt; 1 i))
      (recursion-by-sub2 (- i 2))
      t))
</pre>

Observe that this function recursively decomposes its integer
argument by subtracting <code>2</code> from it repeatedly and stops when the
argument is <code>1</code> or less.  The value of the function is irrelevant; it
is its induction scheme that concerns us.  The induction scheme
suggested by <code>(recursion-by-sub2 i)</code> is

<pre>
(and (implies (not (and (integerp i) (&lt; 1 i)))   ; base case
              (:p i))
     (implies (and (and (integerp i) (&lt; 1 i))    ; induction step
                   (:p (- i 2)))
              (:p i)))
</pre>

We can think of the base case as covering two situations.  The
first is when <code>i</code> is not an integer.  The second is when the integer <code>i</code>
is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.  In the base case we must prove <code>(:p i)</code> without further
help.  The induction step deals with those integer <code>i</code> greater than <code>1</code>,
and inductively assumes the conjecture for <code>i-2</code> while proving it for
<code>i</code>.  Let us call this scheme ``induction on <code>i</code> by twos.''<p>

Suppose the above <code>:induction</code> rule has been added.  Then an
occurrence of, say, <code>(* 1/2 k)</code> in a conjecture to be proved by
induction would suggest, via this rule, an induction on <code>k</code> by twos,
provided <code>k</code> was known to be a nonnegative integer.  This is because
the induction rule's <code>:pattern</code> is matched in the conjecture, its
<code>:condition</code> is satisfied, and the <code>:scheme</code> suggested by the rule is
that derived from <code>(recursion-by-sub2 k)</code>, which is induction on <code>k</code> by
twos.  Similarly, the term <code>(* 1/2 (length l))</code> would suggest no
induction via this rule, even though the rule ``fires'' because it
creates the <code>:scheme</code> <code>(recursion-by-sub2 (length l))</code> which suggests no
inductions unwinding <code>recursion-by-sub2</code> (since the controlling
argument of <code>recursion-by-sub2</code> in this <code>:scheme</code> is not a variable
symbol).<p>

Continuing this example one step further illustrates the utility of
<code>:induction</code> rules.  We could define the function <code>recursion-by-cddr</code>
that suggests the induction scheme decomposing its <code><a href="CONSP.html">consp</a></code> argument
two <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code>s at a time.  We could then add the <code>:induction</code> rule linking
<code>(* 1/2 (length x))</code> to <code>(recursion-by-cddr x)</code> and arrange for
<code>(* 1/2 (length l))</code> to suggest induction on <code>l</code> by <code><a href="CDDR.html">cddr</a></code>.<p>

Observe that <code>:induction</code> rules require no proofs to be done.  Such a
rule is merely a heuristic link between the <code>:pattern</code> term, which may
occur in conjectures to be proved by induction, and the <code>:scheme</code>
term, from which an induction scheme may be derived.  Hence, when an
<code>:induction</code> rule-class is specified in a <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event, the theorem
proved is irrelevant.  The easiest theorem to prove is, of course,
<code>t</code>.  Thus, we suggest that when an <code>:induction</code> rule is to be created,
the following form be used:

<pre>
(defthm name T
  :rule-classes ((:induction :pattern pat-term
                             :condition cond-term
                             :scheme scheme-term)))
</pre>

The name of the rule created is <code>(:induction name)</code>.  When that rune
is disabled the heuristic link between <code>pat-term</code> and <code>scheme-term</code> is
broken.
