This section contains introductory material on ACL2 including what
ACL2 is, how to get started using the system, how to read the
output, and other introductory topics.  It was written almost
entirely by Bill Young of Computational Logic, Inc.<p>

you are familiar with Nqthm.  If you would like more familiarity

<em>OVERVIEW</em><p>

ACL2 is an automated reasoning system developed (for the first 9 years)
at Computational Logic, Inc. and (from January, 1997) at the University
of Texas at Austin.  It is the successor to the Nqthm (or Boyer-Moore)
logic and proof system and its Pc-Nqthm interactive enhancement.  The
acronym ACL2 actually stands for ``A Computational Logic for Applicative
Common Lisp''.  This title suggests several distinct but related aspects
of ACL2.<p>

We assume that readers of the ACL2 <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> have at least a
very slight familiarity with some Lisp-like language.  We will
address the issue of prerequisites further, in ``ABOUT THIS
TUTORIAL'' below.<p>

As a <strong>logic</strong>, ACL2 is a formal system with rigorously defined
syntax and semantics.  In mathematical parlance, the ACL2 logic is a
first-order logic of total recursive functions providing
mathematical induction on the ordinals up to epsilon-0 and two
extension principles: one for recursive definition and one for
constrained introduction of new function symbols, here called
encapsulation.  The syntax of ACL2 is that of Common Lisp; ACL2
specifications are ``also'' Common Lisp programs in a way that we
will make clear later.  In less formal language, the ACL2 logic is
an integrated collection of rules for defining (or axiomatizing)
recursive functions, stating properties of those functions, and
rigorously establishing those properties.  Each of these activities
is mechanically supported.<p>

As a <strong>specification language</strong>, ACL2 supports modeling of systems
of various kinds.  An ACL2 function can equally be used to express
purely formal relationships among mathematical entities, to describe
algorithms, or to capture the intended behavior of digital systems.
For digital systems, an ACL2 specification is a mathematical
<strong>model</strong> that is intended to formalize relevant aspects of system
behavior.  Just as physics allows us to model the behavior of
continuous physical systems, ACL2 allows us to model digital
systems, including many with physical realizations such as computer
hardware.  As early as the 1930's Church, Kleene, Turing and others
established that recursive functions provide an expressive formalism
for modeling digital computation.  Digital computation should be
understood in a broad sense, covering a wide variety of activities
including almost any systematic or algorithmic activity, or activity
that can be reasonably approximated in that way.  This ranges from
the behavior of a digital circuit to the behavior of a programming
language compiler to the behavior of a controller for a physical
system (as long as the system can be adequately modeled discretely).
All of these have been modeled using ACL2 or its predecessor Nqthm.<p>

ACL2 is a <strong>computational</strong> logic in at least three distinct
senses.  First, the theory of recursive functions is often
considered the mathematics of computation.  Church conjectured that
any ``effective computation'' can be modeled as a recursive
function.  Thus, ACL2 provides an expressive language for modeling
digital systems.  Second, many ACL2 specifications are executable.
In fact, recursive functions written in ACL2 <strong>are</strong> Common Lisp
functions that can be submitted to any compliant Common Lisp
compiler and executed (in an environment where suitable
ACL2-specific macros and functions are defined).  Third, ACL2 is
computational in the sense that calculation is heavily integrated
into the reasoning process.  Thus, an expression with explicit
constant values but no free variables can be simplified by
calculation rather than by complex logical manipulations.<p>

ACL2 is a powerful, automated <strong>theorem prover</strong> or proof checker.
This means that a competent user can utilize the ACL2 system to
discover proofs of theorems stated in the ACL2 logic or to check
previously discovered proofs.  The basic deductive steps in an
ACL2-checked proof are often quite large, due to the sophisticated
combination of decision procedures, conditional rewriting,
mathematical and structural induction, propositional simplification,
and complex heuristics to orchestrate the interactions of these
capabilities.  Unlike some automated proof systems, ACL2 does not
produce a formal proof.  However, we believe that if ACL2 certifies
the ``theoremhood'' of a given conjecture, then such a formal proof
exists and, therefore, the theorem is valid.  The ultimate result of
an ACL2 proof session is a collection of ``<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>,'' possibly
grouped into ``<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>,'' that can be replayed in ACL2.  Therefore, a
proof can be independently validated by any ACL2 user.<p>

ACL2 may be used in purely automated mode in the shallow sense that
conjectures are submitted to the prover and the user does not
interact with the proof attempt (except possibly to stop it) until
the proof succeeds or fails.  However, any non-trivial proof attempt
is actually interactive, since successful proof ``<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>''
influence the subsequent behavior of the prover.  For example,
proving a lemma may introduce a rule that subsequently is used
automatically by the prover.  Thus, any realistic proof attempt,
even in ``automatic'' mode, is really an interactive dialogue with
the prover to craft a sequence of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> building an
appropriate theory and proof rules leading up to the proof of the
desired result.  Also, ACL2 supports annotating a theorem with
``<a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>'' designed to guide the proof attempt.  By supplying
appropriate <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>, the user can suggest proof strategies that
the prover would not discover automatically.  There is a
``<a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>'' facility (see <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>) that allows the
user to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the progress and structure of a proof attempt
in real-time.  Exploring failed proof attempts is actually where
heavy-duty ACL2 users spend most of their time.<p>

ACL2 can also be used in a more explicitly interactive mode.  The
``<a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>'' subsystem of ACL2 allows exploration of a proof on
a fairly low level including expanding calls of selected function
symbols, invoking specific <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules, and selectively navigating
around the proof.  This facility can be used to gain sufficient
insight into the proof to construct an automatic version, or to
generate a detailed interactive-style proof that can be replayed in
batch mode.<p>

Because ACL2 is all of these things -- computational logic,
specification language, <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> system, and theorem prover -- it
is more than the sum of its parts.  The careful integration of these
diverse aspects has produced a versatile automated reasoning system
suitable for building highly reliable digital systems.  In the
remainder of this tutorial, we will illustrate some simple uses of
this automated reasoning system.<p>

<em>ABOUT THIS TUTORIAL</em><p>

ACL2 is a complex system with a vast array of features, bells and
whistles.  However, it is possible to perform productive work with
the system using only a small portion of the available
functionality.  The goals of this tutorial are to:

<blockquote><p>

familiarize the new user with the most basic features of and modes
of interaction with ACL2;<p>

familiarize her with the form of output of the system; and<p>

work through a graduated series of examples.
</blockquote>
<p>

The more knowledge the user brings to this system, the easier it
will be to become proficient.  On one extreme:  the <strong>ideal</strong> user
of ACL2 is an expert Common Lisp programmer, has deep understanding
of automated reasoning, and is intimately familiar with the earlier
Nqthm system.  Such ideal users are unlikely to need this tutorial.
However, without some background knowledge, the beginning user is
likely to become extremely confused and frustrated by this system.
We suggest that a new user of ACL2 should:

<blockquote><p>

(a) have a little familiarity with Lisp, including basic Lisp
programming and prefix notation (a Lisp reference manual such as Guy
Steele's ``Common Lisp:  The Language'' is also helpful);<p>

(b) be convinced of the utility of formal modeling; and<p>

(c) be willing to gain familiarity with basic automated theorem
proving topics such as rewriting and algebraic simplification.
</blockquote>
<p>

We will not assume any deep familiarity with Nqthm (the so-called
``Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover''), though the book ``A Computational
Logic Handbook'' by Boyer and Moore (Academic Press, 1988) is an
extremely useful reference for many of the topics required to become
a competent ACL2 user.  We'll refer to it as ACLH below.<p>

As we said in the introduction, ACL2 has various facets.  For
example, it can be used as a Common Lisp <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> system to
construct application programs.  In fact, the ACL2 system itself is
a large Common Lisp program constructed almost entirely within ACL2.
Another use of ACL2 is as a specification and modeling tool.  That
is the aspect we will concentrate on in the remainder of this
tutorial.<p>

<em>GETTING STARTED</em><p>

This section is an abridged version of what's available elsewhere;
feel free to see <a href="STARTUP.html">startup</a> for more details.<p>

How you start ACL2 will be system dependent, but you'll probably
type something like ``acl2'' at your operating system prompt.
Consult your system administrator for details.<p>

When you start up ACL2, you'll probably find yourself inside the
ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop, as indicated by the following <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>.

<pre><p>

  ACL2 !&gt;<p>

</pre>

If not, you should type <code>(LP)</code>.  See <a href="LP.html">lp</a>, which has a lot more
information about the ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop.<p>

There are two ``modes'' for using ACL2, <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> and
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>.  When you begin ACL2, you will ordinarily be in the
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode.  This means that any new function defined is not
only executable but also is axiomatically defined in the ACL2 logic.
(See <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and see <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>.)  Roughly
speaking, <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode is available for using ACL2 as a
<a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> language without some of the logical burdens
necessary for formal reasoning.  In this tutorial we will assume
that we always remain in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode and that our purpose is
to write formal models of digital systems and to reason about them.<p>

Now, within the ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop you can carry out various
kinds of activities, including the folllowing.  (We'll see examples
later of many of these.)

<blockquote><p>

define new functions (see <a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a>);<p>

execute functions on concrete data; <p>

pose and attempt to prove conjectures about previously defined
functions (see <a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a>);<p>

query the ACL2 ``<a href="WORLD.html">world</a>'' or database (e.g., see <a href="PE.html">pe</a>); and<p>

numerous other things. 
</blockquote>
<p>

In addition, there is extensive on-line <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>, of which this
tutorial introduction is a part.<p>

<em>INTERACTING WITH ACL2</em><p>

The standard means of interacting with ACL2 is to submit a sequence
of forms for processing by the ACL2 system.  These forms are checked
for syntactic and semantic acceptability and appropriately processed
by the system.  These forms can be typed directly at the ACL2
<a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>.  However, most successful ACL2 users prefer to do their work
using the Emacs text editor, maintaining an Emacs ``working'' buffer
in which forms are edited.  Those forms are then copied to the ACL2
interaction buffer, which is often the <code>"*shell*"</code> buffer.<p>

In some cases, processing succeeds and makes some change to the ACL2
``logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>,'' which affects the processing of subsequent forms.
How can this processing fail?  For example, a proposed theorem will
be rejected unless all function symbols mentioned have been
previously defined.  Also the ability of ACL2 to discover the proof
of a theorem may depend on the user previously having proved other
theorems.  Thus, the order in which forms are submitted to ACL2 is
quite important.  Maintaining forms in an appropriate order in your
working buffer will be helpful for re-playing the proof later.<p>

One of the most common <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in constructing a model is
introducing new functions.  New functions are usually introduced
using the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> form; we'll encounter some exceptions later.
Proposed function definitions are checked to make sure that they are
syntactically and semantically acceptable (e.g., that all mentioned
functions have been previously defined) and, for recursive
functions, that their recursive calls <strong>terminate</strong>.  A recursive
function definition is guaranteed to terminate if there is some some
``measure'' of the arguments and a ``well-founded'' ordering such
that the arguments to the function get smaller in each recursive
call.  See <a href="WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">well-founded-relation</a>.<p>

For example, suppose that we need a function that will append two
lists together.  (We already have one in the ACL2 <code><a href="APPEND.html">append</a></code>
function; but suppose perversely that we decide to define our own.)
Suppose we submit the following definition (you should do so as well
and study the system output):

<pre><p>

  (defun my-app (x y)
    (if (atom x)
        y
      (cons (car x) (my-app x y))))<p>

</pre>

The system responds with the following message:

<pre><p>

  ACL2 Error in ( DEFUN MY-APP ...):  No :MEASURE was supplied with
  the definition of MY-APP.  Our heuristics for guessing one have not
  made any suggestions.  No argument of the function is tested along
  every branch and occurs as a proper subterm at the same argument
  position in every recursive call.  You must specify a :MEASURE.  See
  :DOC defun.<p>

</pre>

This means that the system could not find an expression involving
the formal parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that decreases under some
well-founded order in every recursive call (there is only one such
call).  It should be clear that there is no such measure in this
case because the only recursive call doesn't change the arguments at
all.  The definition is obviously flawed; if it were accepted and
executed it would loop forever.  Notice that a definition that is
rejected is not stored in the system database; there is no need to
take any action to have it ``thrown away.''  Let's try again with
the correct definition.  The interaction now looks like (we're also
putting in the ACL2 <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>; you don't type that):

<pre><p>

  ACL2 !&gt;(defun my-app (x y)
           (if (atom x)
               y
             (cons (car x) (my-app (cdr x) y))))<p>

  The admission of MY-APP is trivial, using the relation O&lt;
  (which is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized by
  O-P) and the measure (ACL2-COUNT X).  We observe that the
  type of MY-APP is described by the theorem
  (OR (CONSP (MY-APP X Y)) (EQUAL (MY-APP X Y) Y)).
  We used primitive type reasoning.<p>

  Summary
  Form:  ( DEFUN MY-APP ...)
  Rules: ((:FAKE-RUNE-FOR-TYPE-SET NIL))
  Warnings:  None
  Time:  0.07 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.07)
  MY-APP<p>

</pre>

Notice that this time the function definition was accepted.  We
didn't have to supply a measure explicitly; the system inferred one
from the form of the definition.  On complex functions it may be
necessary to supply a measure explicitly.  (See <a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a>.)<p>

The system output provides several pieces of information.

<blockquote><p>

The revised definition is acceptable.  The system realized that
there is a particular measure (namely, <code>(acl2-count x)</code>) and a
well-founded relation (<code>o&lt;</code>) under which the arguments of
<code>my-app</code> get smaller in recursion.  Actually, the theorem prover
proved several theorems to admit <code>my-app</code>.  The main one was that
when <code>(atom x)</code> is false the <code>acl2-count</code> of <code>(cdr x)</code> is less
than (in the <code>o&lt;</code> sense) the <code>acl2-count</code> of <code>x</code>.
<code><a href="ACL2-COUNT.html">Acl2-count</a></code> is the most commonly used measure of the ``size`` of
an ACL2 object.  <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> is the ordering relation on ordinals
less than epsilon-0.  On the natural numbers it is just ordinary
``&lt;''.<p>

The observation printed about ``the type of MY-APP'' means that
calls of the function <code>my-app</code> will always return a value that is
either a <a href="CONS.html">cons</a> pair or is equal to the second parameter.<p>

The summary provides information about which previously introduced
definitions and lemmas were used in this proof, about some notable
things to watch out for (the Warnings), and about how long this
event took to process.
</blockquote>
<p>

Usually, it's not important to read this information.  However, it
is a good habit to scan it briefly to see if the type information is
surprising to you or if there are Warnings.  We'll see an example of
them later.<p>

After a function is accepted, it is stored in the database and
available for use in other function definitions or lemmas.  To see
the definition of any function use the <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> command
(see <a href="PE.html">pe</a>).  For example,

<pre><p>

  ACL2 !&gt;:pe my-app
   L       73:x(DEFUN MY-APP (X Y)
                      (IF (ATOM X)
                          Y (CONS (CAR X) (MY-APP (CDR X) Y))))<p>

</pre>

This displays the definition along with some other relevant
information.  In this case, we know that this definition was
processed in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode (the ``<code>L</code>'') and was the 73rd <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>
processed in the current session.<p>

We can also try out our newly defined function on some sample data.
To do that, just submit a form to be evaluated to ACL2.  For
example,

<pre><p>

  ACL2 !&gt;(my-app '(0 1 2) '(3 4 5))
  (0 1 2 3 4 5)
  ACL2 !&gt;(my-app nil nil)
  NIL
  ACL2 !&gt;<p>

</pre>
<p>

Now suppose we want to prove something about the function just
introduced.  We conjecture, for example, that the length of the
<a href="APPEND.html">append</a> of two lists is the sum of their lengths.  We can formulate
this conjecture in the form of the following ACL2 <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> form.

<pre><p>

  (defthm my-app-length
    (equal (len (my-app x y))
           (+ (len x) (len y))))<p>

</pre>

First of all, how did we know about the functions <code>len</code> and <code><a href="+.html">+</a></code>, etc.?
The answer to that is somewhat unsatisfying -- we know them from our
past experience in using Common Lisp and ACL2.  It's hard to know
that a function such as <code>len</code> exists without first knowing some Common
Lisp.  If we'd guessed that the appropriate function was called
<code><a href="LENGTH.html">length</a></code> (say, from our knowledge of Lisp) and tried <code>:pe length</code>, we
would have seen that <code><a href="LENGTH.html">length</a></code> is defined in terms of <code>len</code>, and we
could have explored from there.  Luckily, you can write a lot of
ACL2 functions without knowing too many of the primitive functions.<p>

Secondly, why don't we need some ``type'' hypotheses?  Does it make
sense to append things that are not lists?  Well, yes.  ACL2 and
Lisp are both quite weakly typed.  For example, inspection of the
definition of <code>my-app</code> shows that if <code>x</code> is not a <a href="CONS.html">cons</a> pair, then
<code>(my-app x y)</code> always returns <code>y</code>, no matter what <code>y</code> is.<p>

Thirdly, would it matter if we rewrote the lemma with the equality
reversed, as follows?

<pre><p>

  (defthm my-app-length2
    (equal (+ (len x) (len y))
           (len (my-app x y)))).<p>

</pre>

The two are <strong>logically</strong> equivalent, but...yes, it would make a
big difference.  Recall our remark that a lemma is not only a
``fact'' to be proved; it also is used by the system to prove other
later lemmas.  The current lemma would be stored as a <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule.
(See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.)  For a <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule, a conclusion of the
form <code>(EQUAL LHS RHS)</code> means to replace instances of the <code>LHS</code> by the
appropriate instance of the <code>RHS</code>.  Presumably, it's better to <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>
<code>(len (my-app x y))</code> to <code>(+ (len x) (len y))</code> than the other way around.
The reason is that the system ``knows'' more about <code><a href="+.html">+</a></code> than it does
about the new function symbol <code>my-app</code>.<p>

So let's see if we can prove this lemma.  Submitting our preferred
<code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> to ACL2 (do it!), we get the following interaction:

<pre>
          --------------------------------------------------
ACL2 !&gt;(defthm my-app-length
  (equal (len (my-app x y))
         (+ (len x) (len y))))<p>

Name the formula above *1.<p>

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are
suggested by this conjecture.  These merge into two derived
induction schemes.  However, one of these is flawed and so we are
left with one viable candidate.<p>

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (LEN X), but
modified to accommodate (MY-APP X Y).  If we let (:P X Y) denote *1
above then the induction scheme we'll use is
(AND (IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP X)) (:P X Y))
     (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X) (:P (CDR X) Y))
              (:P X Y))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit LEN,
namely, the measure (ACL2-COUNT X) is decreasing according to the
relation O&lt; (which is known to be well-founded on the domain
recognized by O-P).  When applied to the goal at hand the
above induction scheme produces the following two nontautological
subgoals.<p>

Subgoal *1/2
(IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP X))
         (EQUAL (LEN (MY-APP X Y))
                (+ (LEN X) (LEN Y)))).<p>

But simplification reduces this to T, using the :definitions of FIX,
LEN and MY-APP, the :type-prescription rule LEN, the :rewrite rule
UNICITY-OF-0 and primitive type reasoning.<p>

Subgoal *1/1
(IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X)
              (EQUAL (LEN (MY-APP (CDR X) Y))
                     (+ (LEN (CDR X)) (LEN Y))))
         (EQUAL (LEN (MY-APP X Y))
                (+ (LEN X) (LEN Y)))).<p>

This simplifies, using the :definitions of LEN and MY-APP, primitive
type reasoning and the :rewrite rules COMMUTATIVITY-OF-+ and
CDR-CONS, to<p>

Subgoal *1/1'
(IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X)
              (EQUAL (LEN (MY-APP (CDR X) Y))
                     (+ (LEN Y) (LEN (CDR X)))))
         (EQUAL (+ 1 (LEN (MY-APP (CDR X) Y)))
                (+ (LEN Y) 1 (LEN (CDR X))))).<p>

But simplification reduces this to T, using linear arithmetic,
primitive type reasoning and the :type-prescription rule LEN.<p>

That completes the proof of *1.<p>

Q.E.D.<p>

</pre>
<p>

Wow, it worked!  In brief, the system first tried to <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> and
simplify as much as possible.  Nothing changed; we know that because
it said ``Name the formula above *1.''  Whenever the system decides
to name a formula in this way, we know that it has run out of
techniques to use other than proof by induction.<p>

The induction performed by ACL2 is structural or ``Noetherian''
induction.  You don't need to know much about that except that it is
induction based on the structure of some object.  The heuristics
infer the structure of the object from the way the object is
recursively decomposed by the functions used in the conjecture.  The
heuristics of ACL2 are reasonably good at selecting an induction
scheme in simple cases.  It is possible to override the heuristic
choice by providing an <code>:induction</code> hint (see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>).  In the
case of the theorem above, the system inducts on the structure of
<code>x</code> as suggested by the decomposition of <code>x</code> in both <code>(my-app x y)</code>
and <code>(len x)</code>.  In the base case, we assume that <code>x</code> is not a
<code><a href="CONSP.html">consp</a></code>.  In the inductive case, we assume that it is a <code><a href="CONSP.html">consp</a></code>
and assume that the conjecture holds for <code>(cdr x)</code>.<p>

There is a close connection between the analysis that goes on when a
function like <code>my-app</code> is accepted and when we try to prove
something inductively about it.  That connection is spelled out well
in Boyer and Moore's book ``A Computational Logic,'' if you'd like to
look it up.  But it's pretty intuitive.  We accepted <code>my-app</code>
because the ``size'' of the first argument <code>x</code> decreases in the
recursive call.  That tells us that when we need to prove something
inductively about <code>my-app</code>, it's a good idea to try an induction on
the size of the first argument.  Of course, when you have a theorem
involving several functions, it may be necessary to concoct a more
complicated <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> schema, taking several of them into account.
That's what's meant by ``merging'' the induction schemas.<p>

The proof involves two cases: the base case, and the inductive case.
You'll notice that the subgoal numbers go <strong>down</strong> rather than up,
so you always know how many subgoals are left to process.  The base
case (<code>Subgoal *1/2</code>) is handled by opening up the function
definitions, simplifying, doing a little rewriting, and performing
some reasoning based on the types of the arguments.  You'll often
encounter references to system defined lemmas (like
<code>unicity-of-0</code>).  You can always look at those with <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code>; but,
in general, assume that there's a lot of simplification power under
the hood that's not too important to understand fully.<p>

The inductive case (<code>Subgoal *1/1</code>) is also dispatched pretty
easily.  Here we assume the conjecture true for the <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code> of the
list and try to prove it for the entire list.  Notice that the
prover does some simplification and then prints out an updated
version of the goal (<code>Subgoal *1/1'</code>).  Examining these gives you a
pretty good idea of what's going on in the proof.<p>

Sometimes one goal is split into a number of subgoals, as happened
with the induction above.  Sometimes after some initial processing
the prover decides it needs to prove a subgoal by induction; this
subgoal is given a name and pushed onto a stack of goals.  Some
steps, like generalization (see ACLH), are not necessarily validity
preserving; that is, the system may adopt a false subgoal while
trying to prove a true one.  (Note that this is ok in the sense that
it is not ``unsound.''  The system will fail in its attempt to
establish the false subgoal and the main proof attempt will fail.)
As you gain facility with using the prover, you'll get pretty good
at recognizing what to look for when reading a proof script.  The
prover's <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> utility helps with monitoring an ongoing
proof and jumping to designated locations in the proof
(see <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>).  See <a href="TIPS.html">tips</a> for a number of useful
pointers on using the theorem prover effectively.<p>

When the prover has successfully proved all subgoals, the proof is
finished.  As with a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>, a summary of the proof is printed.
This was an extremely simple proof, needing no additional guidance.
More realistic examples typically require the user to look carefully
at the failed proof log to find ways to influence the prover to do
better on its next attempt.  This means either:  proving some rules
that will then be available to the prover, changing the global state
in ways that will affect the proof, or providing some <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>
locally that will influence the prover's behavior.  Proving this
lemma (<code>my-app-length</code>) is an example of the first.  Since this is
a <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule, whenever in a later proof an instance of the
form <code>(LEN (MY-APP X Y))</code> is encountered, it will be rewritten to
the corresponding instance of <code>(+ (LEN X) (LEN Y))</code>.  Disabling the
rule by executing the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>

<pre><p>

  (in-theory (disable my-app-length)),<p>

</pre>
 
is an example of a global change to the behavior of the prover
since this <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> will not be performed subsequently (unless the rule
is again <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d).  Finally, we can add a (local) <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a> ``hint''
to a <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>, meaning to <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a> the lemma only in the proof of one
or more subgoals.  For example: 

<pre>

  (defthm my-app-length-commutativity
    (equal (len (my-app x y))
           (len (my-app y x)))
    :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (disable my-app-length))))

</pre>

In this case, the hint supplied is a bad idea since the proof is much
harder with the hint than without it.  Try it both ways.<p>

By the way, to undo the previous event use <code>:u</code> (see <a href="U.html">u</a>).  To
undo back to some earlier event use <code>:ubt</code> (see <a href="UBT.html">ubt</a>).  To view
the current event use <code>:pe :here</code>.  To list several <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> use
<code>:pbt</code> (see <a href="PBT.html">pbt</a>).<p>

Notice the form of the hint in the previous example
(see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>).  It specifies a goal to which the hint applies.
<code>"Goal"</code> refers to the top-level goal of the theorem.  Subgoals
are given unique names as they are generated.  It may be useful to
suggest that a function symbol be <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d only for Subgoal
1.3.9, say, and a different function <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d only on Subgoal
5.2.8.  Overuse of such <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> often suggests a poor global
proof strategy.<p>
