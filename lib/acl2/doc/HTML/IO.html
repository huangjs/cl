Example:
(mv-let
  (channel state)
  (open-input-channel "foo.lisp" :object state)
  (mv-let (eofp obj state)
          (read-object channel state)
          (.
            .
             (let ((state (close-input-channel channel state)))
                   (mv final-ans state))..)))

ACL2 supports input and output facilities equivalent to a subset
of those found in Common Lisp.  ACL2 does not support random access
files or bidirectional streams.  In Common Lisp, input and output
are to or from objects of type <code>stream</code>.  In ACL2, input and output
are to or from objects called ``channels,'' which are actually
symbols.  Although a channel is a symbol, one may think of it
intuitively as corresponding to a Common Lisp stream.  Channels are
in one of two ACL2 packages, <code>"ACL2-INPUT-CHANNEL"</code> and
<code>"ACL2-OUTPUT-CHANNEL"</code>.  When one ``opens'' a file one gets back
a channel whose <code><a href="SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></code> is the file name passed to ``open,''
postfixed with <code>-n</code>, where <code>n</code> is a counter that is incremented
every time an open or close occurs.<p>

There are three channels which are open from the beginning and which
cannot be closed:

<pre>
  acl2-input-channel::standard-character-input-0
  acl2-input-channel::standard-object-input-0
  acl2-input-channel::standard-character-output-0
</pre>

All three of these are really Common Lisp's <code>*standard-input*</code> or
<code>*standard-output*</code>, appropriately.<p>

For convenience, three global variables are bound to these rather
tedious channel names:

<pre>
  *standard-ci*
  *standard-oi*
  *standard-co*
</pre>

Common Lisp permits one to open a stream for several different
kinds of <code>io</code>, e.g. character or byte.  ACL2 permits an additional
type called ``object''.  In ACL2 an ``io-type'' is a keyword, either
<code>:character</code>, <code>:byte</code>, or <code>:object</code>.  When one opens a file, one specifies
a type, which determines the kind of io operations that can be done
on the channel returned.  The types <code>:character</code> and <code>:byte</code> are
familiar.  Type <code>:object</code> is an abstraction not found in Common Lisp.
An <code>:object</code> file is a file of Lisp objects.  One uses <code>read-object</code> to
read from <code>:object</code> files and <code>print-object$</code> to print to <code>:object</code> files.
(The reading and printing are really done with the Common Lisp <code>read</code>
and <code>print</code> functions.)<p>

File-names are strings.  ACL2 does not support the Common Lisp type
<code><a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a></code>.<p>

Here are the names, formals and output descriptions of the ACL2 io 
functions.

<pre>
Input Functions:
  (open-input-channel (file-name io-type state) (mv channel state))
  (open-input-channel-p (channel io-type state) boolean)
  (close-input-channel (channel state) state)
  (read-char$ (channel state) (mv char/nil state)) ; nil for EOF
  (peek-char$ (channel state) boolean)
  (read-byte$ (channel state) (mv byte/nil state)) ; nil for EOF
  (read-object (channel state) (mv eof-read-flg obj-read state))<p>

Output Functions:
  (open-output-channel (file-name io-type state) (mv channel state))
  (open-output-channel-p (channel io-type state) boolean)
  (close-output-channel (channel state) state)
  (princ$ (obj channel state) state)
  (write-byte$ (byte channel state) state)
  (print-object$ (obj channel state) state)
  (fms  (string alist channel state evisc-tuple) state)
  (fms! (string alist channel state evisc-tuple) state)
  (fmt  (string alist channel state evisc-tuple) (mv col state))
  (fmt! (string alist channel state evisc-tuple) (mv col state))
  (fmt1 (string alist col channel state evisc-tuple) (mv col state))
  (fmt1! (string alist col channel state evisc-tuple) (mv col state))
  (cw (string arg0 arg1 ... argn) nil)
</pre>

The ``formatting'' functions are particularly useful;
see <a href="FMT.html">fmt</a> and see <a href="CW.html">cw</a>.  In particular, <code><a href="CW.html">cw</a></code> prints to a
``comment window'' and does not involve the ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>, so many may
find it easier to use than <code><a href="FMT.html">fmt</a></code> and its variants.  The functions
<code><a href="FMS_bang_.html">fms!</a></code>, <code><a href="FMT_bang_.html">fmt!</a></code>, and <code><a href="FMT1_bang_.html">fmt1!</a></code> are the same as their respective functions
without the ``<code>!</code>,'' except that the ``<code>!</code>'' functions are guaranteed to
print forms that can be read back in (at a slight readability cost).<p>

When one enters ACL2 with <code>(lp)</code>, input and output are taken from
<code><a href="_star_STANDARD-OI_star_.html">*standard-oi*</a></code> to <code><a href="_star_STANDARD-CO_star_.html">*standard-co*</a></code>.  Because these are synonyms for
<code>*standard-input*</code> and <code>*standard-output*</code>, one can drive ACL2 io off of
arbitrary Common Lisp streams, bound to <code>*standard-input*</code> and
<code>*standard-output*</code> before entry to ACL2.<p>

By default, symbols are printed in upper case when vertical bars are
not required, as specified by Common Lisp.  See <a href="SET-ACL2-PRINT-CASE.html">set-acl2-print-case</a> for how
to get ACL2 to print symbols in lower case.<p>

By default, numbers are printed in radix 10 (base 10).See <a href="SET-ACL2-PRINT-BASE.html">set-acl2-print-base</a>
for how to get ACL2 to print numbers in radix 2, 8, or 16.<p>

Finally, we note that the distributed book <code>books/misc/file-io.lisp</code>
contains useful file io functions whose definitions illustrate some of the
features described above.
