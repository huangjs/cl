<h2>LD-SKIP-PROOFSP</h2>how carefully ACL2 processes your <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s

<pre>
Examples:
ACL2 !&gt;(set-ld-skip-proofsp t state)
 T
ACL2 !s&gt;(set-ld-skip-proofsp nil state)
 NIL
ACL2 !&gt;(set-ld-skip-proofsp 'include-book state)
 INCLUDE-BOOK
ACL2 !s&gt;
</pre>

<p>
A global variable in the ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>, called <code>'ld-skip-proofsp</code>,
determines the thoroughness with which ACL2 processes your <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s.
This variable may take on one of three values: <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code> or
<code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  When <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the system assumes
that which ought to be proved and is thus unsound.  The form
<code>(set-ld-skip-proofsp flg state)</code> is the general-purpose way of
setting <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code>.  This global variable is an ``<code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> special,''
which is to say, you may call <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> in such a way as to ``bind'' this
variable for the dynamic extent of the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>.<p>

When <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the default <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a> displays the
character <code>s</code>.  Thus, the <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>

<pre>
ACL2 !s&gt;
</pre>

means that the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> is <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> (otherwise the
character <code>p</code>, for <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>, would also be printed;
see <a href="DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a>) but ``proofs are being skipped.''<p>

Observe that there are two legal non-<code>nil</code> values, <code>t</code> and
<code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  When <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>t</code>, ACL2 skips all proof
obligations but otherwise performs all other required analysis of
input <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  When <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>, ACL2 skips not
only proof obligations but all analysis except that required to
compute the effect of successfully executed <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  To explain the
distinction, let us consider one particular event, say a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>.
Very roughly speaking, a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> event normally involves a check of
the syntactic well-formedness of the submitted definition, the
generation and proof of the termination conditions, and the
computation and storage of various rules such as a <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> rule
and some <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rules.  By ``normally'' above we mean
when <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>nil</code>.  How does a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> behave when
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is non-<code>nil</code>?<p>

If <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>t</code>, then <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> performs the syntactic
well-formedness checks and computes and stores the various rules,
but it does not actually carry out the termination proofs.  If
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>, <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> does not do the syntactic
well-formedness check nor does it carry out the termination proof.
Instead, it merely computes and stores the rules under the
assumption that the checks and proofs would all succeed.  Observe
that a setting of <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is ``stronger'' than a setting of <code>t</code>
in the sense that <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> causes <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> to assume even more
about the admissibility of the event than <code>t</code> does.<p>

As one might infer from the choice of name, the <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event
sets <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> to <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> when processing the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> in
a book being loaded.  Thus, <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> does the miminal work
necessary to carry out the effects of every event in the book.  The
syntactic checks and proof obligations were, presumably,
successfully carried out when the book was certified.<p>

A non-<code>nil</code> value for <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> also affects the system's output
messages.  Event summaries (the paragraphs that begin ``Summary''
and display the event forms, rules used, etc.) are not printed when
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  Warnings and observations are printed
when <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>t</code> but are not printed when it is
<code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.<p>

Intuitively, <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> <code>t</code> means skip just the proofs and
otherwise do all the work normally required for an event; while
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is ``stronger'' and means do as little
as possible to process <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  In accordance with this intuition,
<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> are processed when <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>t</code> but are skipped
when <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.<p>

The ACL2 system itself uses only two settings, <code>nil</code> and
<code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>, the latter being used only when executing the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>
inside of a book being included.  The <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> setting of <code>t</code>
is provided as a convenience to the user.  For example, suppose one
has a file of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  By loading it with <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> with <code>ld-skip-proofsp</code>
set to <code>t</code>, the <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> can all be checked for syntactic correctness
and assumed without proof.  This is a convenient way to recover a
state lost by a system crash or to experiment with a modification of
an <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> file.<p>

The foregoing discussion is actually based on a lie.
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is allowed two other values, <code>'initialize-acl2</code> and
<code>'include-book-with-locals</code>.  The first causes behavior similar to <code>t</code>
but skips <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> and avoids some error checks that would
otherwise prevent ACL2 from properly booting.  The second is
identical to <code>'</code><code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> but also executes <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  These
additional values are not intended for use by the user, but no
barriers to their use have been erected.<p>

We close by reminding the user that ACL2 is potentially unsound if
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code> is ever set by the user.  We provide access to it
simply to allow experimentation and rapid reconstruction of lost or
modified logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s.
