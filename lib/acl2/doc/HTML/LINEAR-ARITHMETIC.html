<h2>LINEAR-ARITHMETIC</h2>A description of the linear arithmetic decision procedure

We describe the procedure very roughly here.
Fundamental to the procedure is the notion of a linear polynomial
inequality.  A ``linear polynomial'' is a sum of terms, each of
which is the product of a rational constant and an ``unknown.''  The
``unknown'' is permitted to be <code>1</code> simply to allow a term in the sum
to be constant.  Thus, an example linear polynomial is
<code>3*x + 7*a + 2</code>; here <code>x</code> and <code>a</code> are the (interesting) unknowns.
However, the unknowns need not be variable symbols.  For
example, <code>(length x)</code> might be used as an unknown in a linear
polynomial.  Thus, another linear polynomial is <code>3*(length x) + 7*a</code>.
A ``linear polynomial inequality'' is an inequality 
(either <code><a href="_lt_.html">&lt;</a></code> or <code><a href="_lt_=.html">&lt;=</a></code>)
relation between two linear polynomials.  Note that an equality may
be considered as a pair of inequalities; e.q., <code>3*x + 7*a + 2 = 0</code>
is the same as the conjunction of <code>3*x + 7*a + 2 &lt;= 0</code> and
<code>0 &lt;= 3*x + 7*a + 2</code>.<p>

Certain linear polynomial
inequalities can be combined by cross-multiplication and addition to
permit the deduction of a third inequality with
fewer unknowns.  If this deduced inequality is manifestly false, a
contradiction has been deduced from the assumed inequalities.<p>

For example, suppose we have two assumptions

<pre>
p1:       3*x + 7*a &lt;  4 
p2:               3 &lt;  2*x
</pre>

and we wish to prove that, given <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, <code>a &lt; 0</code>.  As
suggested above, we proceed by assuming the negation of our goal

<pre>
p3:               0 &lt;= a.
</pre>

and looking for a contradiction.<p>

By cross-multiplying and adding the first two inequalities, (that is,
multiplying <code>p1</code> by <code>2</code>, <code>p2</code> by <code>3</code> and adding the respective
sides), we deduce the intermediate result

<pre>
p4:  6*x + 14*a + 9 &lt; 8 + 6*x
</pre>

which, after cancellation, is:

<pre>
p4:        14*a + 1 &lt;  0.
</pre>

If we then cross-multiply and add <code>p3</code> to <code>p4</code>, we get

<pre>
p5:               1 &lt;= 0,
</pre>

a contradiction.  Thus, we have proved that <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> imply the
negation of <code>p3</code>.<p>

All of the unknowns of an inequality must be eliminated by
cancellation in order to produce a constant inequality.  We can
choose to eliminate the unknowns in any order, but we eliminate them in
term-order, largest unknowns first.  (See <a href="TERM-ORDER.html">term-order</a>.)  That is, two
polys are cancelled against each other only when they have the same
largest unknown.  For instance, in the above example we see that <code>x</code>
is the largest unknown in each of <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, and <code>a</code> in
<code>p3</code> and <code>p4</code>.<p>

Now suppose that this procedure does not produce a contradiction but
instead yields a set of nontrivial inequalities.  A contradiction
might still be deduced if we could add to the set some additional
inequalities allowing further cancellations.  That is where
<code>:linear</code> lemmas come in.  When the set of inequalities has stabilized
under cross-multiplication and addition and no contradiction is
produced, we search the data base of <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> rules for rules about
the unknowns that are candidates for cancellation (i.e., are the
largest unknowns in their respective inequalities).  See <a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a>
for a description of how <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> rules are used.<p>

to the linear-arithmetic procedure described here.
