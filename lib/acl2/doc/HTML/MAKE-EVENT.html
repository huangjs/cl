<h2>MAKE-EVENT</h2>evaluate (expand) a given form and then evaluate the result
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>

<code>Make-event</code> is a utility for generating <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  It provides a
capability not offered by Lisp macros (see <a href="DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a>), as it allows access to
the ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> and logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  In essence, the expression
<code>(make-event form)</code> replaces itself with the result of evaluating <code>form</code>,
say, <code>ev</code>, as though one had submitted <code>ev</code> instead of the <code>make-event</code>
call.  But the evaluation of <code>form</code> may involve <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> and even modify
<code>state</code>, for example by attempting to admit some definitions and theorems.
<code>Make-event</code> protects the ACL2 logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> so that it is restored
after <code>form</code> is evaluated, before <code>ev</code> is submitted.

Examples:<p>

; Trivial example: evaluate (quote (defun foo (x) x)) to obtain
; (defun foo (x) x), which is then evaluated.
(make-event (quote (defun foo (x) x)))<p>

; Evaluate (generate-form state) to obtain (mv nil val state), and
; then evaluate val.  (Generate-form is not specified here, but
; imagine for example that it explores the state and then generates
; some desired definition or theorem.)
(make-event (generate-form state))<p>

; As above, but make sure that if this form is in a book, then when
; we include the book, the evaluation of (generate-form state)
; should return the same value as it did when the book was
; certified.
(make-event (generate-form state)
            :check-expansion t)<p>

; As above (where the :check-expansion value can be included or
; not), where if there is an error during expansion, then the error
; message will explain that expansion was on behalf of the indicated
; object, typically specified as the first argument.
(make-event (generate-form state)
            :on-behalf-of (generate-form state))<p>

General Form:
(make-event form :check-expansion chk :on-behalf-of obj)
</pre>

where <code>chk</code> is <code>nil</code> (the default), <code>t</code>, or the intended ``expansion
result'' from the evaluation of <code>form</code> (as explained below); and if
supplied, <code>obj</code> is an arbitrary ACL2 object, used only in reporting errors
in expansion, i.e., in the evaluation of form.<p>

We strongly recommend that you look at <code>books/make-event/Readme.lsp</code>, which
summarizes and suggests browsing of some <code>.lisp</code> files in that directory,
in order to understand <code>make-event</code>, perhaps before continuing to read this
documentation.  For example, <code>eval.lisp</code> contains definitions of macros
<code>must-succeed</code> and <code>must-fail</code> that are useful for testing and are used
in many other books in that directory, especially <code>eval-tests.lisp</code>.  Other
than the examples, the explanations here should suffice for most users.  If
you want explanations of subtler details, see <a href="MAKE-EVENT-DETAILS.html">make-event-details</a>.<p>

<code>Make-event</code> is related to Lisp macroexpansion in the sense that its
argument is evaluated to obtain an expansion result, which is evaluated
again.  Let us elaborate on each of these notions in turn: ``is evaluated,''
``expansion result'', and ``evaluated again.''
<blockquote><p>

``is evaluated'' -- The argument can be any expression, which is evaluated
as would be any expression submitted to ACL2's top level loop.  Thus,
<code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> and user-defined <code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code>s may appear in the form supplied to
<code>make-event</code>.  Henceforth, we will refer to this evaluation as
``expansion.''  Expansion is actually done in a way that restores ACL2's
built-in <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> global variables, including the logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, to
their pre-expansion values (with a few exceptions --
see <a href="MAKE-EVENT-DETAILS.html">make-event-details</a> -- and where we note that changes to user-defined
<code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> global variables (see <a href="ASSIGN.html">assign</a>) are preserved).  So, for example,
events might be evaluated during expansion, but they will disappear from the
logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> after expansion returns its result.  Moreover, proofs are
enabled by default at the start of expansion (see <a href="LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a>), because
an anticipated use of <code>make-event</code> is to call the prover to decide which
event to generate, and that would presumably be necessary even if proofs had
been disabled.<p>

``expansion result'' -- The above expansion may result in an ordinary
(non-<code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>, non-<code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code>) value, which we call the ``expansion
result.''  Or, expansion may result in a multiple value of the form
<code>(mv erp val state stobj-1 ... stobj-k)</code>, where <code>k</code> may be 0; in fact the
most common case is probably <code>(mv erp val state)</code>.  In that case, if
<code>erp</code> is not <code>nil</code>, then there is no expansion result, and the original
<code>make-event</code> evaluates to a soft error.  If however <code>erp</code> is <code>nil</code>,
then the resulting value is <code>val</code>.  Moreover, <code>val</code> must be an embedded
event form (see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>); otherwise, the original <code>make-event</code>
evaluates to a soft error.  Note that error messages from expansion are
printed as described under ``Error Reporting'' below.<p>

``evaluated again'' -- the expansion result is evaluated in place of the
original <code>make-event</code>.<p>

</blockquote>
Note that the result of expansion can be an ordinary event, but it can
instead be another call of <code>make-event</code>, or even of a call of a macro that
expands to a call of <code>make-event</code>.  Or, expansion itself can cause
subsidiary calls of <code>make-event</code>, for example if expansion uses <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> to
evaluate some <code>make-event</code> forms.  The state global variable
<code>make-event-debug</code> may be set to a non-<code>nil</code> value in order to see a
trace of the expansion process, where the level shown (as in ``<code>3&gt;</code>'')
indicates the depth of expansions in progress.<p>

Expansion of a <code>make-event</code> call will yield an event that replaces the
original <code>make-event</code> call.  In particular, if you put a <code>make-event</code>
form in a book, then in essence it is replaced by its expansion result,
created during the proof pass of the <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> process.  We now
elaborate on this idea of keeping the original expansion.<p>

By default, a <code>make-event</code> call in a certified book is replaced (by a
process hidden from the user, in an <code>:expansion-alist</code> field of the book's
<a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>) by the expansion result from evaluation of its first
argument.  Thus, although the book is not textually altered during
certification, one may imagine a ``book expansion'' corresponding to the
original book in which all of the events for which expansion took place
(during the proof phase of certification) have been replaced by their
expansions.  A subsequent <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> will then include the book
expansion corresponding to the indicated book.  When a book is compiled
during <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>, it is actually the corresponding book expansion,
stored as a temporary file, that is compiled instead.  That temporary file is
deleted after compilation unless one first evaluates the form
<code>(assign keep-tmp-files t)</code>.  Note however that all of the original forms
must still be legal <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> (see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).  So for example,
if the first event in a book is <code>(local (defmacro my-id (x) x))</code>, followed
by <code>(my-id (make-event ...))</code>, the final ``<code>include-book</code>'' pass of
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> will fail because <code>my-id</code> is not defined when the
<code>my-id</code> call is encountered.<p>

The preceding paragraph begins with ``by default'' because if you specify
<code>:check-expansion t</code>, then subsequent evaluation of the same <code>make-event</code>
call -- during the second pass of an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or during
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> -- will do the expansion again and check that the
expansion result equals the original expansion result.  In the unusual case
that you know the expected expansion result, <code>res</code>, you can specify
<code>:check-expansion res</code>.  This will will cause a check that every subsequent
expansion result for the <code>make-event</code> form is <code>res</code>, including the
original one.<p>

<strong>Error Reporting.</strong><p>

Suppose that expansion produces a soft error as described above.  That is,
suppose that the argument of a <code>make-event</code> call evaluates to a multiple
value <code>(mv erp val state ...)</code> where <code>erp</code> is not <code>nil</code>.  If <code>erp</code> is
a string, then that string is printed in the error message.  If <code>erp</code> is
a <code><a href="CONS.html">cons</a></code> pair whose <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> is a string, then the error prints
<code>"~@0"</code> with <code>#\0</code> bound to that <code>cons</code> pair; see <a href="FMT.html">fmt</a>.  Any other
non-<code>nil</code> value of <code>erp</code> causes a generic error message to be printed.<p>

<strong>Restriction to the Top Level.</strong><p>

Every form enclosing a <code>make-event</code> call must be an embedded event form
(see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).  This restriction enables ACL2 to track
expansions produced by <code>make-event</code>.  For example:

<pre>
; Legal:
(progn (with-output
        :on summary
        (make-event '(defun foo (x) x))))<p>

; Illegal:
(mv-let (erp val state)
        (make-event '(defun foo (x) x))
        (mv erp val state))
</pre>
