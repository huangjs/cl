<h2>MARKUP</h2>the markup language for ACL2 <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">DOCUMENTATION</a>
</pre><p>

ACL2 <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings make special use of the tilde character
(~).  In particular, we describe here a ``markup language'' for
which the tilde character plays a special role.  The markup language
is valuable if you want to write <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> that is to be
displayed outside your ACL2 session.  If you are not writing such
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>, and if also you do not use the character `~', then
there is no need to read on.
<p>
Three uses of the tilde character (~) in <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings are
as follows.  Below we explain the uses that constitute the ACL2
markup language.

<blockquote>
<code>~/</code><br>

Indicates the end of a documentation <strong>section</strong>;
see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>.<p>

<code>~~</code><br>

Indicates the literal insertion of a tilde character (~).<p>

<code>~]</code><br>

This directive in a documentation string is effective only during
the processing of part 2, the details (see <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a>), and
controls how much is shown on each round of <code>:</code><code><a href="MORE.html">more</a></code> processing when
printing to the terminal.  If the system is not doing <code>:</code><code><a href="MORE.html">more</a></code>
processing, then it acts as though the ~] is not present.
Otherwise, the system put out a newline and halts documentation
printing on the present topic, which can be resumed if the user
types <code>:</code><code><a href="MORE.html">more</a></code> at the terminal.
</blockquote>

The other uses of the tilde character are of the following form.

<pre>
  ~key[arg]
</pre>

Before launching into an explanation of how this works in detail,
let us consider some small examples.<p>

Here is a word that is code:

<pre>
  ~c[function-name].
</pre>

Here is a phrase with an ``emphasized'' word, ``not'':

<pre>
  Do ~em[not] do that.
</pre>

Here is the same phrase, but where ``not'' receives stronger
emphasis (presumably boldface in a printed version):

<pre>
  Do ~st[not] do that.
</pre>

Here is a passage that is set off as a display, in a fixed-width
font:

<pre>
  ~bv[]
  This passage has been set off as ``verbatim''.
  The present line starts just after a line break.  Normally, printed
  text is formatted, but inside ~bv[]...~ev[], line breaks are taken
  literally.
  ~ev[]
</pre>

In general, the idea is to provide a ``markup language'' that can be
reasonably interpreted not only at the terminal (via <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code>), but
also via translators into other languages.  In fact, translators
have been written into Texinfo and HTML.<p>

Let us turn to a more systematic consideration of how to mark text
in <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings using expressions of the form
<code>~key[arg]</code>, which we will call ``<a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a> tilde directives.''
The idea is that <code>key</code> informs the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> printer (which
could be the terminal, a hardcopy printer, or some hypertext tool)
about the ``style'' used to display <code>arg</code>.  The intention is that
each such printer should do the best it can.  For example, we have
seen above that <code>~em[arg]</code> tells the printer to <i>emphasize</i>
<code>arg</code> if possible, using an appropriate display to indicate
emphasis (italics, or perhaps surrounding <code>arg</code> with some character
like <code>_</code>, or ...).  For another example, the directive for bold
font, <code>~b[arg]</code>, says that printed text for <code>arg</code> should be in
bold if possible, but if there is no bold font available (such as at
the terminal), then the argument should be printed in some other
reasonable manner (for example, as ordinary text).  The <code>key</code> part
is case-insensitive; for example, you can use ~BV[] or ~Bv[] or ~bV[] in
place of ~bv[].<p>

Every form below may have any string as the argument (inside
<code>[..]</code>), as long as it does not contain a newline (more on that
below).  However, when an argument does not make much sense to us,
we show it below as the empty string, e.g., ``<code>~bv[]</code>'' rather
than ``<code>~bv[arg]</code>''.

<pre>
~-[]      Print the equivalent of a dash<p>

~b[arg]   Print the argument in bold font, if available<p>

~bid[arg]   ``Begin implementation dependent'' -- Ignores argument at
          terminal.<p>

~bf[]     Begin formatted text (respecting spaces and line breaks),
          but in ordinary font (rather than, say, fixed-width font)
          if possible<p>

~bq[]     Begin quotation (indented text, if possible)<p>

~bv[]     Begin verbatim (print in fixed-width font, respecting
          spaces and line breaks)<p>

~c[arg]   Print arg as ``code'', such as in a fixed-width font<p>

~ef[]     End format; balances ~bf[]<p>

~eid[arg]   ``End implementation dependent'' -- Ignores argument at
          terminal.<p>

~em[arg]  Emphasize arg, perhaps using italics<p>

~eq[]     End quotation; balances ~bq[]<p>

~ev[]     End verbatim; balances ~bv[]<p>

~i[arg]   Print arg in italics font<p>

~id[arg]   ``Implementation dependent'' -- Ignores argument at
          terminal.<p>

~il[arg]  Print argument as is, but make it a link (for true
          hypertext environments)<p>

~ilc[arg] Same as ~il[arg], except that arg should be printed as
          with ~c[arg]<p>

~l[arg]   Ordinary link; prints as ``See :DOC arg'' at the terminal
          (but also see ~pl below, which puts ``see'' in lower case)<p>

~nl[]     Print a newline<p>

~par[]    Paragraph mark, of no significance at the terminal
          (can be safely ignored; see also notes below)<p>

~pl[arg]  Parenthetical link (borrowing from Texinfo):  same as
          ~l[arg], except that ``see'' is in lower case.  This is
          typically used at other than the beginning of a sentence.<p>

~sc[arg]  Print arg in (small, if possible) capital letters<p>

~st[arg]  Strongly emphasize arg, perhaps using a bold font<p>

~t[arg]   Typewriter font; similar to ~c[arg], but leaves less
          doubt about the font that will be used.<p>

~terminal[arg]  Terminal only; arg is to be ignored except when
          reading documentation at the terminal, using :DOC.
</pre>
<p>

<em>Style notes and further details</em><p>

It is not a good idea to put <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a> tilde directives inside
verbatim environments, <code>~bv[] ... ~ev[]</code>.<p>

Do not nest <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a> tilde directives; that is, do not write

<pre>
  The ~c[~il[append] function ...
</pre>

but note that the ``equivalent'' expression

<pre>
  The ~ilc[append] function ...
</pre>

is fine.  The following phrase is also acceptable:

<pre>
  ~bf[]This is
  ~em[formatted] text.
  ~ef[]
</pre>

because the nesting is only conceptual, not literal.<p>

We recommend that for displayed text, <code>~bv[]</code> and <code>~ev[]</code>
should usually each be on lines by themselves.  That way, printed
text may be less encumbered with excessive blank lines.  Here is an
example.

<pre>
  Here is some normal text.  Now start a display:
  ~bv[]
    2 + 2 = 4
  ~ev[]
  And here is the end of that paragraph.<p>

  Here is the start of the next paragraph.
</pre>

The analogous consideration applies to <code>~bf[]</code> and <code>~ef[]</code> as
well as <code>~bq[]</code> and <code>~eq[]</code>.<p>

You may ``quote'' <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> inside the <code>arg</code> part of
<code>~key[arg]</code>, by preceding them with ~.  This is, in fact, the
only legal way to use a newline character or a right bracket (])
inside the argument to a <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a> tilde directive.<p>

Write your <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings without hyphens.  Otherwise, you
may find your text printed on paper (via TeX, for example) like
this --

<pre>
  Here is a hyphe- nated word.
</pre>

even if what you had in mind was:

<pre>
  Here is a hyphe-
  nated word.
</pre>

When you want to use a dash (as opposed to a hyphen), consider using
~-[], which is intended to be interpreted as a ``dash.''  For
example:

<pre>
  This sentence ~-[] which is broken with dashes ~-[] is boring.
</pre>

would be written to the terminal (using <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code>) by replacing
<code>~-[]</code> with two hyphen <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>, but would presumably be
printed on paper with a dash.<p>

Be careful to balance the ``begin'' and ``end'' pairs, such as
<code>~bv[]</code> and <code>~ev[]</code>.  Also, do not use two ``begin''
directives (<code>~bf[]</code>, <code>~bq[]</code>, or <code>~bv[]</code>) without an
intervening ``end'' directive.  It is permissible (and perhaps this
is not surprising) to use the <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a> part separator <code>~/</code> while
between such a begin-end pair.<p>

Because of a bug in texinfo (as of this writing), you may wish to
avoid beginning a line with (any number of spaces followed by) the
<code><a href="_hyphen_.html">-</a></code> character or <code>~-[]</code>.<p>

The ``paragraph'' directive, <code>~par[]</code>, is rarely if ever used.
There is a low-level capability, not presently documented, that
interprets two successive newlines as though they were <code>~par[]</code>.
This is useful for the HTML driver.  For further details, see the
authors of ACL2.<p>

Emacs code is available for manipulating <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings that
contain <a href="DOC-STRING.html">doc-string</a> tilde-directives (for example, for doing a
reasonable job filling such <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings).  See the authors
if you are interested.<p>

We tend to use <code>~em[arg]</code> for ``section headers,'' such as
``Style notes and further details'' above.  We tend to use
<code>~st[arg]</code> for emphasis of words inside text.  This division
seems to work well for our Texinfo driver.  Note that <code>~st[arg]</code>
causes <code>arg</code> to be printed in upper-case at the terminal (using
<code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code>), while <code>~em[arg]</code> causes <code>arg</code> to be printed at the
terminal as though <code>arg</code> were not marked for emphasis.<p>

Our Texinfo and HTML drivers both take advantage of capabilities for
indicating which <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> need to be ``escaped,'' and how.  Unless
you intend to write your own driver, you probably do not need to
know more about this issue; otherwise, contact the ACL2 authors.  We
should probably mention, however, that Texinfo makes the following
requirement:  when using <code>~l[arg]</code>, where <code>arg</code> contains
one of the special <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> <code><a href="_at_.html">@</a></code>, <code>{</code>, or <code>}</code>, you must
immediately follow this use with a period or comma.  Also, the Emacs
``info'' <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> that we generate by using our Texinfo driver
has the property that in node names, <code>:</code> has been replaced by <code>|</code>
(because of quirks in info); so for example, the ``<a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>''
simplification command, <code>s</code>, is documented under <code>acl2-pc||s</code>
rather than under <code>acl2-pc::s</code>.<p>

We have tried to keep this markup language fairly simple; in
particular, there is no way to refer to a link by other than the
actual name.  So for example, when we want to make <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> an
invisible link in ``code'' font, we write the following form, which
indicates that <code>:</code> should be in that font and then <code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> should
both be in that font and be an invisible link.
