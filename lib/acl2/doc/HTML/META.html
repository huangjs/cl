<h2>META</h2>make a <code>:meta</code> rule (a hand-written simplifier)
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">RULE-CLASSES</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a general discussion of rule classes and
how they are used to build rules from formulas.  Meta rules extend
the ACL2 simplifier with hand-written code to transform certain
terms to equivalent ones.  To add a meta rule, the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code>
formula must establish that the hand-written ``metafunction''
preserves the meaning of the transformed term.<p>

Example <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> formulas from which <code>:meta</code> rules might be
built are:

<pre>
Examples:
(equal (evl x a)                  ; Modify the rewriter to use fn to
       (evl (fn x) a))            ; transform terms.  The :trigger-fns
                                  ; of the :meta rule-class specify
                                  ; the top-most function symbols of
                                  ; those x that are candidates for
                                  ; this transformation.<p>

(implies (and (pseudo-termp x)    ; As above, but this illustrates
              (alistp a))         ; that without loss of generality we
         (equal (evl x a)         ; may restrict x to be shaped like a
                (evl (fn x) a)))  ; term and a to be an alist.<p>

(implies (and (pseudo-termp x)    ; As above (with or without the
              (alistp a)          ; hypotheses on x and a) with the
              (evl (hyp-fn x) a)) ; additional restriction that the
         (equal (evl x a)         ; meaning of (hyp-fn x) is true in
                (evl (fn x) a)))  ; the current context.  That is, the
                                  ; applicability of the transforma-
                                  ; tion may be dependent upon some
                                  ; computed hypotheses.
</pre>

A non-<code>nil</code> list of function symbols must be supplied as the value
of the <code>:trigger-fns</code> field in a <code>:meta</code> rule class object.
<p>

<pre>
General Forms:
(implies (and (pseudo-termp x)        ; this hyp is optional
              (alistp a)              ; this hyp is optional
              (ev (hyp-fn x ...) a))  ; this hyp is optional
         (equiv (ev x a)
                (ev (fn x ...) a)))
</pre>

where <code>equiv</code> is a known <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation, <code>x</code> and
<code>a</code> are distinct variable names, and <code>ev</code> is an evaluator
function (see below), and <code>fn</code> is a function symbol, as is
<code>hyp-fn</code> when provided.  The arguments to <code>fn</code> and <code>hyp-fn</code>
should be identical.  In the most common case, both take a single
argument, <code>x</code>, which denotes the term to be simplified.  If <code>fn</code>
and/or <code>hyp-fn</code> are <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>ed, their <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s should be
(implied by) <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code>.  See <a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a>.  We say the
theorem above is a ``metatheorem'' or ``metalemma'' and <code>fn</code> is a
``metafunction'', and <code>hyp-fn</code> is a ``hypothesis metafunction''.<p>

If ``<code>...</code>'' is empty, i.e., the metafunctions take just one argument,
we say they are ``vanilla flavored.''  If ``<code>...</code>'' is non-empty,
we say the metafunctions are ``extended.''  Extended
metafunctions can access <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> and context sensitive information
to compute their results, within certain limits.  We discuss vanilla
metafunctions here and recommend a thorough understanding of them
before proceeding (at which time
see <a href="EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>).<p>

We defer discussion of the case in which there is a hypothesis
metafunction and for now address the case in which the other two
hypotheses are present.<p>

In the discussion below, we refer to the argument, <code>x</code>, of <code>fn</code>
and <code>hyp-fn</code> as a ``term.''  When these metafunctions are executed
by the simplifier, they will be applied to (the quotations of)
terms.  But during the proof of the metatheorem itself, <code>x</code> may not
be the quotation of a term.  If the <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> hypothesis is
omitted, <code>x</code> may be any object.  Even with the <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code>
hypothesis, <code>x</code> may merely ``look like a term'' but use
non-function symbols or function symbols of incorrect arity.  In any
case, the metatheorem is stronger than necessary to allow us to
apply the metafunctions to terms, as we do in the discussion below.
We return later to the question of proving the metatheorem.<p>

Suppose the general form of the metatheorem above is proved with the
<code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> and <code><a href="ALISTP.html">alistp</a></code> hypotheses.  Then when the simplifier
encounters a term, <code>(h t1 ... tn)</code>, that begins with a function
symbol, <code>h</code>, listed in <code>:trigger-fns</code>, it applies the
metafunction, <code>fn</code>, to the quotation of the term, i.e., it
evaluates <code>(fn '(h t1 ... tn))</code> to obtain some result, which can be
written as <code>'val</code>.  If <code>'val</code> is different from <code>'(h t1 ... tn)</code>
and <code>val</code> is a term, then <code>(h t1 ... tn)</code> is replaced by <code>val</code>,
which is then passed along for further rewriting.  Because the
metatheorem establishes the correctness of <code>fn</code> for all terms (even
non-terms!), there is no restriction on which function symbols are
listed in the <code>:trigger-fns</code>.  Generally, of course, they should be
the symbols that head up the terms simplified by the metafunction
<code>fn</code>.  See <a href="TERM-TABLE.html">term-table</a> for how one obtains some assistance
towards guaranteeing that <code>val</code> is indeed a term.<p>

The ``evaluator'' function, <code>ev</code>, is a function that can evaluate a
certain class of expressions, namely, all of those composed of
variables, constants, and applications of a fixed, finite set of
function symbols, <code>g1</code>, ..., <code>gk</code>.  Generally speaking, the set of
function symbols handled by <code>ev</code> is chosen to be exactly the
function symbols recognized and manipulated by the metafunctions
being introduced.  For example, if <code>fn</code> manipulates expressions in
which <code>'</code><code><a href="EQUAL.html">equal</a></code> and <code>'</code><code><a href="BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></code> occur as function
symbols, then <code>ev</code> is generally specified to handle <code><a href="EQUAL.html">equal</a></code> and
<code><a href="BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></code>.  The actual requirements on <code>ev</code> become clear
when the metatheorem is proved.  The standard way to introduce an
evaluator is to use the ACL2 macro <code><a href="DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></code>, though this is
not strictly necessary.  See <a href="DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a> for details.<p>

Why are we justified in using metafunctions this way?  Suppose
<code>(fn 'term1)</code> is <code>'term2</code>.  What justifies replacing <code>term1</code> by
<code>term2</code>?  The first step is to assert that <code>term1</code> is
<code>(ev 'term1 a)</code>, where <code>a</code> is an alist that maps <code>'var</code> to
<code>var</code>, for each variable <code>var</code> in <code>term1</code>.  This step is
incorrect, because <code>'term1</code> may contain function symbols other than
the ones, <code>g1</code>, ..., <code>gk</code>, that <code>ev</code> knows how to handle.  But we
can grow <code>ev</code> to a ``larger'' evaluator, <code>ev*</code>, an evaluator for
all of the symbols that occur in <code>term1</code> or <code>term2</code>.  We can prove
that <code>ev*</code> satisfies the <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s on <code>ev</code>.  Hence, the
metatheorem holds for <code>ev*</code> in place of <code>ev</code>, by functional
instantiation.  We can then carry out the proof of the
<a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> of <code>term1</code> and <code>term2</code> as follows: Fix <code>a</code> to be
an alist that maps the quotations of the variables of <code>term1</code> and
<code>term2</code> to themselves.  Then,

<pre>
term1 = (ev* 'term1 a)      ; (1) by construction of ev* and a
      = (ev* (fn 'term1) a) ; (2) by the metatheorem for ev*
      = (ev* 'term2 a)      ; (3) by evaluation of fn
      = term2               ; (4) by construction of ev* and a
</pre>

Note that in line (2) above, where we appeal to the (functional
instantiation of the) metatheorem, we can relieve its (optional)
<code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> and <code><a href="ALISTP.html">alistp</a></code> hypotheses by appealing to the facts
that <code>term1</code> is a term and <code>a</code> is an alist by construction.<p>

Finally, we turn to the second case, in which there is a hypothesis
metafunction.  In that case, consider as before what happens when
the simplifier encounters a term, <code>(h t1 ... tn)</code>, where <code>h</code> is
listed in <code>:trigger-fns</code>.  This time, after it applies <code>fn</code> to
<code>'(h t1 ... tn)</code> to obtain the quotation of some new term, <code>'val</code>,
it then applies the hypothesis metafunction, <code>hyp-fn</code>.  That is, it
evaluates <code>(hyp-fn '(h t1 ... tn))</code> to obtain some result, which
can be written as <code>'hyp-val</code>.  If <code>hyp-val</code> is not in fact a term,
the metafunction is not used.  Provided <code>hyp-val</code> is a term, the
simplifier attempts to establish (by conventional backchaining) that
this term is non-<code>nil</code> in the current context.  If this attempt
fails, then the meta rule is not applied.  Otherwise, <code>(h t1...tn)</code>
is replaced by <code>val</code> as in the previous case (where there was no
hypothesis metafunction).<p>

Why is it justified to make this extension to the case of hypothesis
metafunctions?  First, note that the rule

<pre>
(implies (and (pseudo-termp x)
              (alistp a)
              (ev (hyp-fn x) a))
         (equal (ev x a)
                (ev (fn x) a)))
</pre>

is logically equivalent to the rule

<pre>
(implies (and (pseudo-termp x)
              (alistp a))
         (equal (ev x a)
                (ev (new-fn x) a)))
</pre>

where <code>(new-fn x)</code> is defined to be 
<code>(list 'if (hyp-fn x) (fn x) x)</code>.  (If we're careful, we realize
that this argument depends on making an extension of <code>ev</code> to an
evaluator <code>ev*</code> that handles <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code> and the functions manipulated by
<code>hyp-fn</code>.)  If we write <code>'term</code> for the quotation of the present
term, and if <code>(hyp-fn 'term)</code> and <code>(fn 'term)</code> are both terms, say
<code>hyp1</code> and <code>term1</code>, then by the previous argument we know it is
sound to rewrite term to <code>(if hyp1 term1 term)</code>.  But since we have
established in the current context that <code>hyp1</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, we
may simplify <code>(if hyp1 term1 term)</code> to <code>term1</code>, as desired.<p>

We now discuss the role of the <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> hypothesis.
<code>(Pseudo-termp x)</code> checks that <code>x</code> has the shape of a term.
Roughly speaking, it ensures that <code>x</code> is a symbol, a quoted
constant, or a true list consisting of a <code>lambda</code> expression or
symbol followed by some pseudo-terms.  Among the properties of terms
not checked by <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> are that variable symbols never begin
with ampersand, <code>lambda</code> expressions are closed, and function
symbols are applied to the correct number of arguments.
See <a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a>.<p>

There are two possible roles for <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> in the development
of a metatheorem:  it may be used as the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> of the
metafunction and/or hypothesis metafunction and it may be used as a
hypothesis of the metatheorem.  Generally speaking, the
<code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> hypothesis is included in a metatheorem only if it
makes it easier to prove.  The choice is yours.  (An extreme example
of this is when the metatheorem is invalid without the hypothesis!)
We therefore address ourselves the question:  should a metafunction
have a <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>?  A <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> for
a metafunction, in connection with other considerations described
below, improves the efficiency with which the metafunction is used
by the simplifier.<p>

To make a metafunction maximally efficient you should (a) provide it
with a <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> and exploit the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> when
possible in coding the body of the function
(see <a href="GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>, especially the section on
efficiency issues), (b) verify the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of the metafunction
(see <a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>), and (c) compile the metafunction
(see <a href="COMP.html">comp</a>).  When these three steps have been taken the simplifier
can evaluate <code>(fn 'term1)</code> by running the compiled ``primary code''
(see <a href="GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>) for <code>fn</code> directly in Common Lisp.<p>

Before discussing efficiency issues further, let us review for a
moment the general case in which we wish to evaluate <code>(fn `obj)</code>
for some <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> function.  We must first ask whether the
<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of <code>fn</code> have been verified.  If not, we must evaluate
<code>fn</code> by executing its logic definition.  This effectively checks
the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of every subroutine and so can be slow.  If, on the
other hand, the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of <code>fn</code> have been verified, then we can
run the primary code for <code>fn</code>, provided <code>'obj</code> satisfies the
<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> of <code>fn</code>.  So we must next evaluate the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> of
<code>fn</code> on <code>'obj</code>.  If the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is met, then we run the primary
code for <code>fn</code>, otherwise we run the logic code.<p>

Now in the case of a metafunction for which the three steps above
have been followed, we know the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is (implied by)
<code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> and that it has been verified.  Furthermore, we know
without checking that the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is met (because <code>term1</code> is a
term and hence <code>'term1</code> is a <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code>).  Hence, we can use
the compiled primary code directly.<p>

We strongly recommend that you compile your metafunctions, as well
as all their subroutines.  Guard verification is also recommended.<p>

Finally, we present a very simple example of the use of <code>:meta</code>
rules, based on one provided by Robert Krug.  This example
illustrates a trick for avoiding undesired rewriting after applying
a metafunction or any other form of rewriting.  To elaborate: in
general, the term <code>t2</code> obtained by applying a metafunction to a
term <code>t1</code> is then handed immediately to the rewriter, which
descends recursively through the arguments of function calls to
rewrite <code>t2</code> completely.  But if <code>t2</code> shares a lot of structure
with <code>t1</code>, then it might not be worthwhile to rewrite <code>t2</code>
immediately.  (A rewrite of <code>t2</code> will occur anyhow the next time a
goal is generated.)  The trick involves avoiding this rewrite by
wrapping <code>t2</code> inside a call of <code><a href="HIDE.html">hide</a></code>, which in turn is inside
a call of a user-defined ``unhiding'' function, <code>unhide</code>.<p>


<pre>
(defun unhide (x)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  x)<p>

(defthm unhide-hide
  (equal (unhide (hide x))
         x)
  :hints (("Goal" :expand ((hide x)))))<p>

(in-theory (disable unhide))<p>

(defun my-plus (x y)
  (+ x y))<p>

(in-theory (disable my-plus))<p>

(defevaluator evl evl-list
  ((my-plus x y)
   (binary-+ x y)
   (unhide x)
   (hide x)))<p>

(defun meta-fn (term)
  (declare (xargs :guard (pseudo-termp term)))
  (if (and (consp term)
           (equal (length term) 3)
           (equal (car term) 'my-plus))
      `(UNHIDE (HIDE (BINARY-+ ,(cadr term) ,(caddr term))))
    term))<p>

(defthm my-meta-lemma
  (equal (evl term a)
         (evl (meta-fn term) a))
  :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (enable my-plus)))
  :rule-classes ((:meta :trigger-fns (my-plus))))<p>

</pre>
<p>

Notice that in the following (silly) conjectre, ACL2 initially does
only does the simplification directed by the metafunction; a second
goal is generated before the commuativity of addition can be
applied.  If the above calls of <code>UNHIDE</code> and <code>HIDE</code> had been
stripped off, then <code>Goal'</code> would have been the term printed in
<code>Goal''</code> below.<p>


<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(thm
        (equal (my-plus b a)
               ccc))<p>

This simplifies, using the :meta rule MY-META-LEMMA and the :rewrite
rule UNHIDE-HIDE, to<p>

Goal'
(EQUAL (+ B A) CCC).<p>

This simplifies, using the :rewrite rule COMMUTATIVITY-OF-+, to<p>

Goal''
(EQUAL (+ A B) CCC).
</pre>
<p>

The discussion above probably suffices to make good use of this
<code>(UNHIDE (HIDE ...))</code> trick.  However, we invite the reader who
wishes to understand the trick in depth to evaluate the following
form before submitting the <code><a href="THM.html">thm</a></code> form above.

<pre>
(trace$ (rewrite :entry (list (take 2 arglist))
                 :exit (list (car values)))
        (rewrite-with-lemma :entry (list (take 2 arglist))
                            :exit (take 2 values)))
</pre>

The following annotated subset of the trace output (which may appear
a bit different depending on the underlying Common Lisp
implementation) explains how the trick works.<p>


<pre>
    2&gt; (REWRITE ((MY-PLUS B A) NIL))&gt;
      3&gt; (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA
              ((MY-PLUS B A)
               (REWRITE-RULE (:META MY-META-LEMMA)
                             1822
                             NIL EQUAL META-FN NIL META NIL NIL)))&gt;<p>

We apply the meta rule, then recursively rewrite the result, which is the
(UNHIDE (HIDE ...)) term shown just below.<p>

        4&gt; (REWRITE ((UNHIDE (HIDE (BINARY-+ B A)))
                     ((A . A) (B . B))))&gt;
          5&gt; (REWRITE ((HIDE (BINARY-+ B A))
                       ((A . A) (B . B))))&gt;<p>

The HIDE protects its argument from being touched by the rewriter.<p>

          &lt;5 (REWRITE (HIDE (BINARY-+ B A)))&gt;
          5&gt; (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA
                  ((UNHIDE (HIDE (BINARY-+ B A)))
                   (REWRITE-RULE (:REWRITE UNHIDE-HIDE)
                                 1806 NIL EQUAL (UNHIDE (HIDE X))
                                 X ABBREVIATION NIL NIL)))&gt;<p>

Now we apply UNHIDE-HIDE, then recursively rewrite its right-hand
side in an environment where X is bound to (BINARY-+ B A).<p>

            6&gt; (REWRITE (X ((X BINARY-+ B A))))&gt;<p>

Notice that at this point X is cached, so REWRITE just returns
(BINARY-+ B A).<p>

            &lt;6 (REWRITE (BINARY-+ B A))&gt;
          &lt;5 (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA T (BINARY-+ B A))&gt;
        &lt;4 (REWRITE (BINARY-+ B A))&gt;
      &lt;3 (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA T (BINARY-+ B A))&gt;
    &lt;2 (REWRITE (BINARY-+ B A))&gt;
