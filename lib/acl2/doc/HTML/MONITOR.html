<h2>MONITOR</h2>to monitor the attempted application of a rule name
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">BREAK-REWRITE</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
(monitor '(:rewrite assoc-of-app) 't)
:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) t
:monitor (:definition app) (equal (brr@ :target) '(app c d))
<p>
General Form:
(monitor rune term)
</pre>

where <code>rune</code> is a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> and <code>term</code> is a term, called the ``break
condition.'' <code>Rune</code> must be either a <code>:rewrite</code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> or a
<code>:definition</code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.<p>

When a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> is <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed any attempt to apply it may result in an
interactive break in an ACL2 ``<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.'' There you will get
a chance to see how the application proceeds.
See <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for a description of the interactive loop
entered.  Whether an interactive break occurs depends on the value
of the break condition expression associated with the <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed
<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.<p>

NOTE: Some <code>:rewrite</code> rules are considered ``simple abbreviations'';
see <a href="SIMPLE.html">simple</a>.  These can be be monitored, but only at certain times during the
proof.  Monitoring is carried out by code inside the rewriter but
abbreviation rules may be applied by a special purpose simplifier inside the
so-called <em>preprocess</em> phase of a proof.  If you desire to monitor an
abbreviation rule, a warning will be printing suggesting that you may want to
supply the hint <code>:DO-NOT '(PREPROCESS)</code>; see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Without such a hint,
an abbreviation rule can be applied during the preprocess phase of a proof,
and no such application will cause an interactive break.<p>

To remove a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> from the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s, use <code>unmonitor</code>.
To see which <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s are <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed and what their break conditions
are, evaluate <code>(monitored-runes)</code>.<p>

<code>Monitor</code>, <code>unmonitor</code> and <code>monitored-runes</code> are macros that expand into
expressions involving <code>state</code>.  While these macros appear to return
the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s this is an illusion.  They all print
<a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> information to the comment window and then return
error triples instructing <code>ld</code> to print nothing.  It is impossible to
return the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s because it exists only in the
<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a> with which you interact when a break occurs.  This
allows you to change the <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s and their conditions during
the course of a proof attempt without changing the <a href="STATE.html">state</a> in which
the the proof is being constructed.<p>

Unconditional break points are obtained by using the break condition
<code>t</code>.  We now discuss conditional break points.  The break condition,
<code>expr</code>, must be a term that contains no free variables other than
<code>state</code> and that returns a single non-<code>state</code> result.  In fact, the
result should be <code>nil</code>, <code>t</code>, or a true list of commands to be fed to the
resulting interactive break.  Whenever the system attempts to use
the associated rule, <code>expr</code> is evaluated in the <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> interaction
<a href="STATE.html">state</a>.  A break occurs only if the result of evaluating <code>expr</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.  If the result is a true list, that list is appended to the
front of <code>standard-oi</code> and hence is taken as the initial user commands
issued to the interactive break.<p>

In order to develop effective break conditions it must be possible
to access context sensitive information, i.e., information about the
context in which the <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> is being tried.  The <code>brr@</code> macro
may be used in break conditions to access such information as the
term being rewritten and the current governing assumptions.  This
information is not stored in the proof <a href="STATE.html">state</a> but is transferred into
the <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="STATE.html">state</a> when breaks occur.  The macro form is <code>(brr@ :sym)</code>
where <code>:sym</code> is one of several keyword symbols, including <code>:target</code> (the
term being rewritten), <code>:unify-subst</code> (the substitution that
instantiates the left-hand side of the conclusion of the rule so
that it is the target term), and <code>:type-alist</code> (the governing
assumptions).  See <a href="BRR_at_.html">brr@</a>.<p>

For example,

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) 
                (equal (brr@ :target) '(app a (app b c)))
</pre>

will monitor <code>(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</code> but will cause an interactive
break only when the target term, the term being rewritten, is
<code>(app a (app b c))</code>.<p>

Because break conditions are evaluated in the interaction
environment, the user developing a break condition for a given <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>
can test candidate break conditions before installing them.  For
example, suppose an unconditional break has been installed on a
<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>, that an interactive break has occurred and that the user has
determined both that this particular application is uninteresting
and that many more such applications will likely occur.  An
appropriate response would be to develop an expression that
recognizes such applications and returns <code>nil</code>.  Of course, the hard
task is figuring out what makes the current application
uninteresting.  But once a candidate expression is developed, the
user can evaluate it in the current context simply to confirm that
it returns <code>nil</code>.<p>

Recall that when a break condition returns a non-<code>nil</code> true list that
list is appended to the front of <code>standard-oi</code>.  For example,

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) '(:go)
</pre>

will cause <code>(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</code> to be <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed and will make
the break condition be <code>'(:go)</code>.  This break condition always
evaluates the non-<code>nil</code> true list <code>(:go)</code>.  Thus, an interactive break
will occur every time <code>(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</code> is tried.  The break
is fed the command <code>:go</code>.  Now the command <code>:go</code> causes <code>break-rewrite</code> to
(a) evaluate the attempt to apply the lemma, (b) print the result of
that attempt, and (c) exit from the interactive break and let the
proof attempt continue.  Thus, in effect, the above <code>:monitor</code> merely
``traces'' the attempted applications of the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> but never causes
an interactive break requiring input from the user.<p>

It is possible to use this feature to cause a conditional break
where the effective break condition is tested <strong>after</strong> the lemma has
been tried.  For example:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite lemma12) 
                '(:unify-subst
                  :eval$ nil
                  :ok-if (or (not (brr@ :wonp))
                             (not (equal (brr@ :rewritten-rhs) '(foo a))))
                  :rewritten-rhs)
</pre>

causes the following behavior when <code>(:rewrite lemma12)</code> is tried.  A
break always occurs, but it is fed the commands above.  The first,
<code>:unify-subst</code>, causes <code>break-rewrite</code> to print out the unifying
substitution.  Then in response to <code>:eval$</code> <code>nil</code> the lemma is tried but
with all <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s temporarily <a href="UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a>ed.  Thus no breaks will occur
during the rewriting of the hypotheses of the lemma.  When the
attempt has been made, control returns to <code>break-rewrite</code> (which will
print the results of the attempt, i.e., whether the lemma was
applied, if so what the result is, if not why it failed).  The next
command, the <code>:ok-if</code> with its following expression, is a conditional
exit command.  It means exit <code>break-rewrite</code> if either the attempt was
unsuccessful, <code>(not (brr@ :wonp))</code>, or if the result of the rewrite is
any term other than <code>(foo a)</code>.  If this condition is met, the break is
exited and the remaining break commands are irrelevant.  If this
condition is not met then the next command, <code>:rewritten-rhs</code>, prints
the result of the application (which in this contrived example is
known to be <code>(foo a)</code>).  Finally, the list of supplied commands is
exhausted but <code>break-rewrite</code> expects more input.  Therefore, it
begins prompting the user for input.  The end result, then, of the
above <code>:monitor</code> command is that the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> in question is elaborately
traced and interactive breaks occur whenever it rewrites its target
to <code>(foo a)</code>.<p>

We recognize that the above break condition is fairly arcane.  We
suspect that with experience we will develop some useful idioms.
For example, it is straightforward now to define macros that monitor
<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s in the ways suggested by the following names:  <code>trace-rune</code>,
<code>break-if-target-is</code>, and <code>break-if-result-is</code>.  For example, the last
could be defined as

<pre>
(defmacro break-if-result-is (rune term)
  `(monitor ',rune
            '(quote (:eval :ok-if
                           (not (equal (brr@ :rewritten-rhs) ',term))))))
</pre>

(Note however that the submitted term must be in translated form.)<p>

Since we don't have any experience with this kind of control on
lemmas we thought it best to provide a general (if arcane) mechanism
and hope that the ACL2 community will develop the special cases that
we find most convenient.
