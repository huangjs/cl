Frequently, engineers use mathematical models.  Use of such
models frequently lead to<p>

<b>better designs</B>,<p>

<b>faster completion of acceptable products</B>, and<p>

<b>reduced overall cost</B>,<p>

because models allow the trained user to study the design before it
is built and analyze its properties.  Usually, testing and analyzing
a model is cheaper and faster than fabricating and refabricating the
product.<p>
