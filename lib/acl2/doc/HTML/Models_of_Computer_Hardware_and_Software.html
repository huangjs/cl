<h2>Models of Computer Hardware and Software</h2>

<p>

Computing machines, whether hardware or software or some combintation,
are frequently modeled as ``state machines.''<p>

To so model a computing machine we must represent its <b>states</B> as objects
in our mathematical framework.<p>

<b>Transitions</B> are functions or relations on state objects.<p>

In what language shall we define these objects, functions, and relations?<p>

The mathematical languages we were taught in high school<p>

<b>algebra</B>,<p>

<b>geometry</B>,<p>

<b>trignometry</B>, and<p>

<b>calculus</B><p>

are inappropriate for modeling digital systems.  They primarily let us talk
about numbers and continuous functions.<p>

To see what kind of expressive power we need, take a closer look at
what a typical state contains.<p>
