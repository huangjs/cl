<h2>NOTE-2-4</h2>ACL2 Version  2.4 (August, 1999) Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

Important changes:  <p>

We corrected a soundness bug in Version 2.3 related to the handling of
<code><a href="IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a></code>.  The bad behavior was noticed by Robert
Krug.  Thanks!<p>

We corrected a bug that permitted <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code> to accept a function
even though a subfunction had not yet had its guards verified.  Thanks to
John Cowles for noticing this.<p>

User defined single-threaded objects are now supported.  See <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.

<p>
Less important notes:<p>

We corrected a bug that prevented the intended expansion of some recursive
function calls.<p>

We changed the handling of the primitive function <code><a href="ILLEGAL.html">ILLEGAL</a></code>, which
is logically defined to be <code>nil</code> but which is programmed to signal an
error, so that when it is evaluated as part of a proof, it does not signal
an error.  The old handling of the function prevented some guard proofs
involving <code><a href="THE.html">THE</a></code> or <code><a href="LET.html">LET</a></code>s with internal declarations.<p>

We corrected a bug that permitted some <code>LOCAL</code> <code>DEFAXIOM</code> events to slip 
into certified books.<p>

We corrected a bug that prevented the correct undoing of certain <code>DEFPKG</code>
forms.<p>

Changes were made to support CMU Lisp.  Pete Manolios helped with these
changes.<p>

Changes were made to make the make files more compatible with Allegro
Common Lisp.  Jun Sawada, who has been a great help with keeping ACL2
up and running at UT on various platforms, was especially helpful.
Thanks Jun.<p>
