<h2>NOTE-2-5</h2>ACL2 Version  2.5 (June, 2000) Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

Important Changes:  <p>

Concurrent with the release of ACL2 Version  2.5 is the publication
of two books about ACL2.  See the ``Books and Papers about ACL2 and Its
Applications'' on the ACL2 Home Page.  <p>

The <code>books</code> subdirectory now contains many new certifiable books,
including solutions to the exercises in the two published books and
full scripts for the case studies.  See <code>books/README.html</code>.<p>

Improved Unix <code>Makefile</code> support for book certification has also been
written.  See <code>books/README.html</code>.<p>

The list of symbols in <code>*acl2-exports*</code> has been considerably expanded.
If you have packages built by importing <code>*acl2-exports*</code> you might want
to look carefully at the new value of that constant.  The new value includes
all <code>:logic</code> mode functions as of Version  2.5, as well as all documented
macros and all built-in theorem names.<p>

<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></code> and <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> were modified to
have some additional keyword arguments.  It is possible to
certify a book containing <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> and/or <code><a href="SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></code>
events and get warning messages or errors signaled, according to
the settings of these new flags.  In addition, it is possible to
specify in <code>include-book</code> whether the book must be certified
(under penalty of error if not).  The default values of these new
arguments cause warnings to be printed rather than errors signaled.<p>

The above change involved altering the form of certificate files.
When books certified under previous versions are included, more
warnings will be generated because these books are considered
possibly to contain <code>defaxiom</code> and/or <code>skip-proofs</code> events.<p>

We anticipate further changes to this aspect of books and consider
the current mechanisms (for controlling whether warnings or errors
are signaled) just a prototype.  See also the discussion below of
``soundness related'' warnings.  Your suggestions are welcome.<p>

A discrepancy between ACL2 and Common Lisp was fixed, having to do
with <code>declare ignore</code>.  In past versions of ACL2, a formal
parameter of a <code>defun</code> was considered ignored if it was not used
in the body, the guard or the measure of the <code>defun</code>.  That meant
that a variable used only in the guard could not be declared ignored
in ACL2; but some Common Lisp compilers would complain because the
variable was not used in the body.  Now, ACL2 considers a variable
ignored if it is not used in the body.<p>

ACL2 can now be built in releases 5.0 and later of Allegro Common
Lisp.  (Other releases of Allegro Common Lisp and of other lisps
continue to be supported as well.)  This includes Allegro Common
Lisp running on Windows 98 platforms.  John Cowles helped us do
some testing and answered questions for us.  Thanks John!<p>

We incorporated Ruben Gamboa's changes to allow the building of a
variant, ACL2(r), of ACL2, in which the user can reason about the real
numbers using non-standard analysis.  See <a href="REAL.html">real</a>.  Note that ACL2(r)
and ACL2 have different underlying theories, and books certified in
one system may not be included in the other.  For backward
compatibility and to ensure a smooth transition, ACL2 is built by
default, not ACL2(r).  This is a compile-time switch; see the 
makefile for instructions.  There should be no changes to ACL2
resulting from the capability of building ACL2(r) from the same
sources.  Also see <a href="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.html">acknowledgments</a> for more on the history of
ACL2(r).<p>

A large number of bugs (some affecting soundness) were fixed, and
many small new features were added.  See below.<p>


<p>
Less Important Changes:<p>

Some warnings are now considered ``soundness related,'' namely,
those that advise you that an uncertified book has been included
or that a book containing <code>DEFAXIOM</code> or <code>SKIP-PROOFS</code> events.
(Technically, <code>DEFAXIOM</code>s do not imperil soundness in the proof-
theoretic sense, though they may imperil the validity of theorems.
But you sould know when a book has added an axiom to your logic!)  In
previous versions of ACL2, all warnings were inhibited if the token
<code>warning</code> was included in the argument to
<code><a href="SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></code>.  Now, soundness related warnings are
printed even if <code>warning</code>s have been inhibited.  To inhibit all
warnings, supply the token <code>warning!</code> to <code>set-inhibit-output-lst</code>.<p>

Several bugs in <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code> were fixed, relating to the
possibility that some of the subfunctions introduced by the
<code>defstobj</code> were already defined.<p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="PUFF.html">Puff</a></code> no longer tries to expand <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code> events.
Previously, the attempt would cause a hard error.

A soundness bug was fixed.  The bug might have been exercised if you
had an alternative definition (implies hyps (equiv (fn ...) body)) in
which equiv is an equivalence relation other than EQUAL.  In this case,
calls of fn might have been expanded to body in places that were not
equiv-hittable.<p>

An obscure soundness bug was fixed.  The bug was exercised only if
you had a metafunction with a computed hypothesis (i.e., a ``meta
hypothesis function''), the hypothesis contained a free variable,
i.e., a variable not involved in the term being rewritten, and the
free variable occurred in the output of the metafunction.  The
possibility of this bug was brought to our attention by Robert Krug.<p>

We fixed a bug in the handling of <code>hide</code> related to the question
of whether a variable symbol occurs in a term.  The old code did not
find the variable and could cause the system to throw away a
hypothesis about it on the grounds that it was never mentioned.  Rob
Sumners helped discover this problem.<p>

The handling of <code>:</code><code><a href="ELIM.html">elim</a></code> rules was generalized, permitting arbitrary
known equivalence relations instead of merely <code>equal</code> in the
concluding equality.<p>

The printing of runes (rule names; see <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>) used has been made
"deterministic," both in proof output and in proof attempt
summaries, by sorting the runes before printing.<p>

The handling of free variables has been improved for hypotheses such
as <code>(&lt; 0 X)</code>, and more generally, any hypotheses involving a
comparison with <code>0</code> (even for example <code>(&lt; X 1)</code> where <code>X</code> is known to be
an integer, which is handled as <code>(&lt;= X 0)</code>).  Thanks to Robert Krug
for bringing relevant examples to our attention.<p>

A new value, <code>:comp</code>, has been implemented for the
<code>:load-compiled-file</code> keyword of <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  If this
value is supplied, then a compiled file will always be loaded, even
if that requires creating the compiled file first.<p>

The event <code>include-book</code> now generates a warning when a compiled
file is expected but not found (see <a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>).  Formerly,
it only did so when executed at the top level; it failed to generate
the warning when executed on behalf of a surrounding <code>include-book</code>
command.<p>

Certain redefinition warnings generated by Allegro Common Lisp have
been eliminated.<p>

A new key has been implemented for the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>,
<code>:bogus-mutual-recursion-ok</code>, set with <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-BOGUS-MUTUAL-RECURSION-OK.html">set-bogus-mutual-recursion-ok</a></code>.
Thanks to David Russinoff for pointing out the utility of such a key.<p>

A bug was fixed in <code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code> that prevented its generated events from
being accepted when guard verification is being performed.  Thanks
to Bill Young for bringing this problem to our attention.  A second
bug was brought to our attention by Pete Manolios, which was causing
certain <code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code> events to be rejected.  That problem has been
fixed, and an "Infected" warning has also been eliminated.<p>

The command <code><a href="GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a></code> now works with Allegro Common Lisp.<p>

A low-level bug was fixed that could, for example, cause an error
such as "Error: Expected 5 args but received 4 args" when
interrupting a <code>local</code> event.<p>

A bug has been fixed in the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> related to definition
expansion.  Thanks to Pete Manolios for bringing this to our attention with a
simple example.<p>

A bug has been fixed related to the <code>:</code><a href="BDD.html">bdd</a> hint in the presence of
<a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relations.  Thanks to Pete Manolios for bringing this to our
attention with a simple example.<p>

The functions <code><a href="POSITION.html">position</a></code> and <code><a href="POSITION-EQUAL.html">position-equal</a></code> formerly
required the second argument to be a true list.  In accordance with
Common Lisp, we now also allow the second argument to be a string.
This could cause earlier proofs about these functions to fail unless
<code><a href="TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></code> is known to hold where necessary.<p>

Robert Krug wrote a patch, which has been incorporated, to prevent
certain infinite loops that can arise in linear arithmetic.  Thanks,
Robert!<p>

The macro <code><a href="LET_star_.html">let*</a></code> no longer requires the bound variables to be
distinct.<p>

An obscure bug was fixed related to congruence rules.  The bug would
sometimes cause ACL2 to behave as though no rules (other than equality)
were available for some argument positions.  Thanks to Pete Manolios for
bringing this bug to our attention.<p>

Documentation topics have been added for <code><a href="HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a></code> and <code><a href="PROG2$.html">prog2$</a></code>,
and the documentation for <code><a href="ILLEGAL.html">illegal</a></code> has been improved.  Thanks to Rob
Sumners for a useful suggestion in the examples in documentation for
<code>prog2$</code> and a fix in documentation for <code><a href="SUBLIS.html">sublis</a></code>.<p>

The event form <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> was made more secure, in that it can now
catch attempts to write a book to disk during its certification.
Thanks to Rob Sumners for pointing out the insecurity of the
existing mechanism.<p>

A Y2K problem was fixed with our applicative handling of dates.<p>

Accessors and updaters for <code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code>s have been made more efficient when
the underlying lisp is Allegro Common Lisp, by the use of
appropriate simple array declarations.<p>

A raw Lisp break had been possible when a certified book that had no
guard verification was included in a session after
<code>(</code><code><a href="SET-VERIFY-GUARDS-EAGERNESS.html">set-verify-guards-eagerness</a></code><code> 2)</code>.  This has been fixed.<p>

The keyword command <code>:</code><code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code> can now be used to compile only raw
Lisp functions, excluding executable counterparts, by supplying the
argument <code>:raw</code>.<p>

Rewrite rule <code>nth-of-character-listp</code> was removed from source file
axioms.lisp since it is essentially subsumed by <code>characterp-nth</code>.<p>

Printing has been sped up.  In one example the improvement was over
50% in both Allegro and GCL.<p>

We now allow printing in a "downcase" mode, where symbols are
printed in lower case.  All printing functions except <code>print-object$</code>
now print characters in lower case for a symbol when the ACL2 state
global variable <code>print-case</code> has value <code>:downcase</code> and vertical bars are
not necessary for printing that symbol.  See <a href="IO.html">IO</a> for a discussion of
the macros <code>acl2-print-case</code> and <code>set-acl2-print-case</code>.  The default
printing remains unchanged, i.e., symbols are printed in upper case
when vertical bars are not required.<p>

A low-level printing function (<code>prin1$</code>) was modified so that it is
not sensitive to various Common Lisp globals related to printing.  So
for example, the function <code><a href="FMT.html">fmt</a></code> is no longer sensitive to the value
of Common Lisp global <code>*print-case*</code>.  (The preceding paragraph
explains how to control the case for printing in ACL2.)<p>

The definition of <code><a href="ARRAY1P.html">array1p</a></code> was fixed so that the <code>:maximum-length</code> of
an array must be strictly greater than the number specified in the
<code>:dimensions</code> field; they may no longer be equal.  This was always the
intention; the documentation (see <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a>) has remained unchanged.
The corresponding change was also made to <code><a href="ARRAY2P.html">array2p</a></code>.  Allegro Common
Lisp formerly caused an error when <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></code> was called on an array
where the numbers above were equal; now, we get a guard violation
instead, which is appropriate.<p>

In the context of theories, a name now represents not just the
corresponding <code>:definition</code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>, as it has done in earlier versions
of ACL2, but also the corresponding <code>:</code><code><a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a></code> rune.
See <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> for a discussion of runic designators.  Most users
will rarely, if ever, notice this change.  One situation where this
change will make a difference is after executing
<code>(in-theory (current-theory 'foo))</code> followed by
<code>(in-theory (enable bar))</code>, where function <code>bar</code> is introduced after
event <code>foo</code>, and <code>bar</code> is recursively defined.  The latter <code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code>
form now enables the rune <code>(:induction bar)</code>, which implies that the
prover can use the induction scheme stored at definition time for
<code>bar</code>.  Formerly, the rune <code>(:induction bar)</code> was not enabled by
<code>(in-theory (enable bar))</code>, and hence the induction scheme for <code>bar</code> was
ignored even when explicit <code>:induct</code> hints were supplied.<p>

You may now supply <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code> keyword pair <code>:normalize nil</code> in order to
prevent certain definitions from ``hanging'' when there are many
<code>if</code>-subexpressions.  see <a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a>.<p>

We now translate type declarations of <code>real</code> into guards, as we have
already done for other types such as <code>rational</code>.  For example,
<code>(declare (type real x))</code> generates the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> <code>(rationalp x)</code>.
See <a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a>.<p>

The theorem prover now behaves reasonably under the combination of
specifying a value of <code>t</code> both for <code>:</code><code><a href="OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></code> and for a hint
<code>:do-not-induct</code>.  Previously, it aborted the first time it would have
otherwise pushed a goal for induction, but now, it will continue and
wait until all induction subgoals have been pushed before it aborts.<p>

We changed slightly the definition of <code><a href="ROUND.html">round</a></code>.  However, we believe
that the new definition is equivalent to the old.<p>

The definition of Common Lisp function <code><a href="SUBSTITUTE.html">substitute</a></code> has been added.<p>

The following changes have been made in the use of file names within
ACL2.  We thank Warren Hunt and John Cowles for running some tests
of these changes on Macintosh and Windows 98 platforms
(respectively).
<blockquote><p>

(1) Names of directories and files now use a syntax like that used
for Unix (trademark of AT&amp;T), where directories are separated using
the ``<code>/</code>'' character even when the operating system is not Unix or
Linux.  See <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>.  ACL2 also continues to support its notion
of <em>structured pathnames</em> from Version  2.4 and before, but might not
do so in future releases and hence no longer documents such syntax.<p>

(2) The command <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a></code> may now take a relative pathname
as an argument.<p>

(3) When the macro <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> is given a file name as a value for
<code><a href="STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></code>, then if that file name is a relative pathname
it refers to the result of prepending the connected book directory
(see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>, see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>, and see <a href="SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a>) in order to
obtain an absolute pathname.  Simiarly for the <code>ld</code> specials
<code><a href="STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a></code> and <code><a href="PROOFS-CO.html">proofs-co</a></code>.<p>

</blockquote>
It is no longer necessary to issue <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-STATE-OK.html">set-state-ok</a></code><code> t</code> if you
include a <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a> declaration for <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>, for example:

<pre>
(declare (xargs :stobjs state))
</pre>

See <a href="DECLARE-STOBJS.html">declare-stobjs</a>.<p>

The <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> has been cleaned up a bit, including the
documentation and the capability (once again) to define pc-macro
commands (see <a href="DEFINE-PC-MACRO.html">define-pc-macro</a>) and proof-checker meta commands
(see <a href="DEFINE-PC-META.html">define-pc-meta</a>).<p>

Recall that events generate summaries that include a line beginning
with ``<code>Warnings:</code>'', which is followed (on the same line) by zero or
more brief strings that summarize the warnings generated by that
event.  Formerly, this warnings summary for an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event did not include the summary strings for
warnings generated by subsidiary events.  This has been fixed.<p>

Macro <code><a href="CW.html">cw</a></code> has been documented and now expands to a call of
a <code>;</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode function.  See <a href="CW.html">cw</a> for a way to print to the screen
without having to involve the ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  Thanks to Rob Sumners
for suggesting that we document this useful utility.<p>

Functions <code>duplicates</code>, <code>add-to-set-equal</code>, <code>intersection-eq</code>, <code>evens</code>, and
<code>odds</code> are now <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode functions.<p>
