<h3>NOTE-2-6-PROOF-CHECKER</h3>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on Proof-checker Changes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="NOTE-2-6.html">NOTE-2-6</a>
</pre><p>

The proof-checker command <code>=</code>, when used with no arguments, now
reports which hypothesis is being used.<p>

The output from <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command <code>type-alist</code> has been
improved.<p>

A slight change has been made to the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> for commands
<code>promote</code>, <code>casesplit</code>, <code>equiv</code>, and <code>=</code>, so that terms of the form
<code>(if x nil y)</code> are recognized as conjunctions, <code>(and (not x) y)</code>.
Thanks to Pete Manolios for suggesting that we consider such a change.<p>

There is a new <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command <code>print-all-concs</code> that prints
all the conclusions of the unproved goals.<p>

A new <code><a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a></code> command, <code>runes</code>, has been added.  It reports
the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s that have participated in the interactive proof up to the
current point.<p>
