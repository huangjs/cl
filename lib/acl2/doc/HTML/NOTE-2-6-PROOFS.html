<h3>NOTE-2-6-PROOFS</h3>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on Changes in Proof Engine

Certain optimizations are performed when converting terms to clausal
form.  For example, <code>(&lt; 0 1)</code> is known to be <code>t</code>, 
<code>(HARD-ERROR ctx str alist)</code> is known to be <code>nil</code>, and
<code>(INTEGERP n)</code> is known to imply <code>(RATIONALP n)</code>.

In earlier versions of ACL2, the conversion of a term to clausal
form expanded <code>LAMBDA</code> applications.  That may no longer occur.
Some proofs may slow down (or fail) because your
<code>LAMBDA</code>-expressions are not expanded away when you ``expected''
them to be.<p>

Robert Krug found a soundness bug in our linear arithmetic package.
The bug was caused by the derivation of an equation from two
inequalities without taking adequate precautions to ensure that both
sides of the inequalities were numeric.  Robert also kindly provided
a fix which we adopted.  Thanks Robert!<p>

We fixed a bug that could prevent the application of a metatheorem.<p>

A bug has been fixed that had caused bogus forcing rounds
(see <a href="FORCING-ROUND.html">forcing-round</a>).  The bug could occur when the hypothesis of
a rule was forced (see <a href="FORCE.html">force</a>) before the prover decided to start
over and prove the original goal by induction.  Thanks to Rob
Sumners for drawing our attention to this problem.<p>

Some low-level fixes have been made that prevent certain infinite
loops, based on reports by users.  We thank Yunja Choi, Matt
Wilding, and Pete Manolios for reporting such problems.<p>

An obscure potential soundness hole has been fixed by redoing the
way evaluation takes place in the ACL2 loop and during theorem
proving.  We expect that users will see no difference based on this
change.  (Those interested in the details can see the long comment
``Essay on Evaluation in ACL2'' in source file interface-raw.lisp.)<p>

A small change was made in computation for a heuristic that controls
backchaining.  This will speed up proofs dramatically in a very few
cases but should have a very small impact in general.<p>

The simplifier has been modified to avoid eliminating hypotheses of
goals that can be established by contextual (specifically, type-set)
reasoning alone.  We believe that this change will generally
strengthen ACL2's reasoning engine, although on rare occasions a
lemma that formerly was provable may require user assistance.
Thanks to Robert Krug for suggesting this change and providing its
implementation.<p>

Case splits are now limited, by default.  This may allow some proof
attempts to provide output where previously the prover would appear
to ``go out to lunch.''  For a more complete discussion, including
instructions for how users can control case splitting,
see <a href="SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a>.<p>

A bug has been fixed in the handling of <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rules by
the <a href="BDD.html">bdd</a> package.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for discovering this bug
and supplying a helpful example.<p>

ACL2 may now use the built-in induction scheme for a function symbol
even if that function symbol is disabled.  Formerly, if a function
symbol was disabled then its induction scheme was only considered if
an explicit induction hint was supplied, other than <code>:induct t</code>.<p>

We eliminated the rule-class <code>linear-alias</code>.  This rule class was seldom
used and complicated the linear arithmetic decision procedure in ways that
made it difficult to extend to handle some non-linear special cases.  
The only use of the rule-class that we know of was in our own <code>nqthm</code>
books, which were an attempt to provide an embedding of the Nqthm logic
and theorem prover into ACL2.  But that facility was also practically
never used, as far as we know.  So both <code>linear-alias</code> rules and the
<code>nqthm</code> books have been eliminated.<p>

In earlier versions of ACL2, when the <code>IF</code>-form of <code>(AND p q)</code> was
assumed true -- as when rewriting the <code>alpha</code> expression in
<code>(IF (AND p q) alpha beta)</code> -- the assumption mechanism did not deduce
that <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are true, only that their conjunction, in its
<code>IF</code>-form, is true.  This has long been known as a deficiency in
both ACL2 and the earlier Nqthm but it was tedious to do better when
one considered the full range of <code>IF</code>-forms one might encounter in the
test of another <code>IF</code>.  Rather than code all the cases, we just waited
until clausification got rid of them.  Robert Krug developed a pretty
nice treatment of the general case and we added it in this version.
This also involved a surprising number of changes elsewhere in the system
because the improved handling of assumptions caused the theorem prover
often to ``erase'' hypotheses provided by <code>:use</code> hints because it could
simplify them to <code>t</code>.  Thank you Robert!<p>

In response to a suggestion from Robert Krug, we added <code>mfc-ap</code> so
that extended metafunctions can take advantage of linear arithmetic.
See <a href="EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>.<p>

There is less delay in printing goals.  In previous versions, a
goal was not printed until its subgoals were created (or the goal
was proved).  Now, the goal is printed essentially as soon as it is
created.<p>

A small technical change has been made in the function <code><a href="TERM-ORDER.html">term-order</a></code>,
to give priority on the function symbol count over the weighting of
constants.  So for example, while previously the term <code>(f)</code> preceded
the constant 2, that is no longer the case.  If this change is noticed
at all, it will probably be noticed in how so-called <em>permutative</em>
rewrite rules are applied; see <a href="LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug
for suggesting this improvement and providing part of the
implemtation.<p>
