<h3>NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY</h3>ACL2 Version  2.7 Notes on New Functionality
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="NOTE-2-7.html">NOTE-2-7</a>
</pre><p>

ACL2 now has a more powerful technique for relieving a <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or
<code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> rule's hypothesis that contains free variables.  A new
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> section has been written describing the handling free
variables in rules; see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>.  In brief, the primary change is
that when a free-variable match for the current hypothesis fails to allow
subsequent hypotheses to be relieved, then additional matches may be
attempted until they have all been tried.  Also see <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> (discussion
of <code>:match-free</code>).  Also see <a href="SET-MATCH-FREE-ERROR.html">set-match-free-error</a>,
see <a href="SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a>, and see <a href="ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> for interfaces
provided to the user for controlling the way ACL2 deals with free variables
in hypotheses.  We thank Rob Sumners for several helpful discussions about
the designs of those interfaces, as well as Eric Smith and Robert Krug for
helpful related discussions.  Robert Krug also found a performance bug in a
preliminary version, for which we are grateful.<p>

WARNING: Book certification attempts may take much longer now that, by
default, ACL2 looks for more free variable matches (see paragraph just
above).  You can get the old behavior by inserting the form

<pre>
(set-match-free-default :once)
</pre>

just after the initial <code><a href="IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></code> form.  However, rules from included
books that have free variables can still slow down certification.  This can
be fixed by inserting

<pre>
(add-match-free-override :once t)
</pre>

before the first event in the file that generates a proof.<p>

<a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">Forward-chaining</a> has been made more powerful in the presence of free
variables (see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), thanks to a contribution by Erik Reeber.
Both before and now, when an attempt is made to relieve (prove) a hypothesis
of a <code>:forward-chaining</code> rule in the case that at least one variable in
that hypothesis is not yet bound, ACL2 looks in the current context for an
instance of that hypothesis.  If it finds one, then it binds the unbound
variables and continues to the next hyopothesis.  What is new is that ACL2
can now looks for multiple instances of that hypothesis.  Consider the
following example; an explanation is below.

<pre>
(encapsulate (((op * *) =&gt; *))
             (local (defun op (x y) (&lt; x y)))
             (defthm transitivity-of-op
               (implies (and (op x y) (op y z)) (op x z))
               :rule-classes :forward-chaining))<p>

; fails in Version_2.6; succeeds in in Version_2.7
(thm (implies (and (op a b) (op b c) (op b e)) (op a c)))
</pre>

Before Version_2.7, the proof of the <code>thm</code> above fails.  When the
<code>:forward-chaining</code> rule <code>transitivity-of-op</code> binds <code>x</code> to <code>a</code> and
<code>y</code> to <code>b</code>, it then looks for an instance of <code>(op y z)</code> in the current
context, with <code>y</code> bound to <code>b</code> but <code>z</code> unbound.  It happens to find
<code>(op b e)</code> before <code>(op b c)</code>, and it then adds <code>(op a e)</code> to the
context.  But starting with Version_2.7, it continues to look for additional
instances and finds <code>(op b c)</code> in the context as well, chaining forward to
<code>(op a c)</code> and thus proving the theorem.<p>

A new macro, <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code>, provides a simple way to get much or most of
the power of <a href="META.html">meta</a>functions.  Thanks to Eric Smith for coming up with the
idea and to Robert Krug for providing an implementation (which we modified
only very slightly) and documentation. See <a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a> and
see <a href="BIND-FREE-EXAMPLES.html">bind-free-examples</a>.<p>

With the addition of <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code> (mentioned above), <code><a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></code> has
become a macro, although that change should be transparent to the user.  More
importantly, the argument of <code>syntaxp</code> may now refer to variables <code>mfc</code>
and <code>state</code>, giving <code>syntaxp</code> some of the power of extended metafunctions;
see <a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a> and see <a href="EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for
implementing that extension.  Also, the argument of <code><a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></code> may now
include calls of <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode functions.  See <a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a> and
see <a href="SYNTAXP-EXAMPLES.html">syntaxp-examples</a> (thanks to Robert Krug for updating the former and
creating the latter documentation).<p>

The linear-arithmetic decision procedure (see <a href="LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear-arithmetic</a>) has now
been extended so that ACL2 can reason about non-linear arithmetic as well
(see <a href="NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a> for how to turn on this feature).  We thank
Robert Krug for the initial implementation of this, and Eric Smith for finding
a couple of bugs in it.<p>

Some <code><a href="TRACE.html">trace</a></code> utilities have been made available in the ACL2 loop.
<blockquote><p>

o Function <code><a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a></code> (and also <code><a href="UNTRACE$.html">untrace$</a></code>) calls the corresponding
underlying Lisp routine <code>trace</code> (and <code>untrace</code>), which however continues
(as it has for some time) to be enhanced for GCL and Allegro CL.<p>

o Macro <code><a href="OPEN-TRACE-FILE.html">open-trace-file</a></code> causes trace output to go to a specified
file.  Macro <code><a href="CLOSE-TRACE-FILE.html">close-trace-file</a></code> causes trace output to go to the
screen (which is the default).<p>

o Macro <code><a href="WITH-ERROR-TRACE.html">with-error-trace</a></code> (or, <code><a href="WET.html">wet</a></code> for short) causes a backtrace
to be written out for many failures, including guard violations.  See <a href="TRACE.html">trace</a>,
see <a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a>, and see <a href="WET.html">wet</a>.<p>

</blockquote>
<p>

A new <code><a href="THEORY.html">theory</a></code>, <code><a href="MINIMAL-THEORY.html">minimal-theory</a></code> has been provided (see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>).
It can be particularly useful for speeding up proofs involving <code>:use</code>
<a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

New <code><a href="EVENTS.html">events</a></code> <code><a href="DEFUND.html">defund</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFTHMD.html">defthmd</a></code> behave exactly like
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>, respectively, except that these new events
disable the new name.<p>

The new macro <code><a href="WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></code> can be used to suppress output that would
normally result from evaluation of a form.<p>

The form <code>(</code><code><a href="PSTACK.html">pstack</a></code><code>)</code> can give the user an idea of what the
prover has been up to during a proof, or after a user-aborted proof.
Moreover, by evaluating <code>(verbose-pstack t)</code> (see <a href="VERBOSE-PSTACK.html">verbose-pstack</a>)
one can get <a href="TRACE.html">trace</a>-like information about prover functions, including
time summaries, printed to the screen during a proof.  Thanks to Bill Legato
and Robert Krug for initiating this work and to Robert for providing some
initial implementation.<p>

The new command <code>:</code><code><a href="COMP-GCL.html">comp-gcl</a></code> is identical in functionality, except
that it always leaves <code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code> files when compiling in GCL.  Thanks
to Rob Sumners and Vernon Austel for suggesting such a capability.<p>

The macro <code><a href="E_slash_D.html">e/d</a></code> provides a convenient way to <code><a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a></code> some rules and
<code><a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a></code> others.  It was formerly in a book supplied with the
distribution, <code>books/ihs/ihs-init.lisp</code>, written by Bishop Brock (who we
thank for providing this useful macro).<p>

New distributed books include those in <code>books/ordinals/</code>,
<code>books/rtl/rel3/</code>, and <code>books/misc/simplify-defuns.lisp</code> (which is
documented in <code>books/misc/simplify-defuns.txt</code>).<p>

The <code>:expand</code> hint now accepts a special value, <code>:LAMBDAS</code>, that tells
the ACL2 rewriter to expand all lambda applications (<code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code> expressions).
See <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

A new function <code><a href="ZPF.html">zpf</a></code> has been added as fast test against 0 for
nonnegative fixnums.<p>

A new macro <code><a href="GC$.html">gc$</a></code> allows the user to call the garbage collector of the
underlying Common Lisp.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for suggesting this feature.<p>

It is now possible to <code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code> <a href="SIMPLE.html">simple</a> (abbreviation) rules.
However, as a warning explains, they are still not considered monitored
during preprocessing; see <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for providing this
improvement.<p>

The second argument of <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>, if supplied, formerly had to be
either <code>t</code> or a non-negative integer.  Now it can be the symbol <code>?</code>, in
the <code>ACL2</code> package, indicating that the usual check should be suppressed on
the number of commands that have been executed to create the world in which
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> was called.<p>
