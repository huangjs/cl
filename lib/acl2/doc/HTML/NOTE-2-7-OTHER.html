<h3>NOTE-2-7-OTHER</h3>ACL2 Version  2.7 Notes on Miscellaneous Changes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="NOTE-2-7.html">NOTE-2-7</a>
</pre><p>

Made several minor <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> improvements.  We are grateful to Eric
Smith for suggesting (most of) these.<p>

Improved <code>(show-bdd)</code> (see <a href="BDD.html">bdd</a>) to give more useful feedback when there
are ``leaf'' terms not known to be Boolean.<p>

Sped up processing of large mutual-recursion nests.  In one large example the
speedup was roughly two orders of magnitude.<p>

Modified event printing so that if both <code>'prove</code> and <code>'event</code>
are inhibited, then events are no longer printed on behalf of
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>, <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>, or <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code>.  Thanks
to Eric Smith for prompting consideration of such a change.<p>

The following technical change was made to support <code><a href="WITH-ERROR-TRACE.html">with-error-trace</a></code> and
<code><a href="WET.html">wet</a></code> (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a>), but may be of interest to those
who do low-level programming using the ACL2 logical <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>.  The
<code>'unnormalized-body</code> property is now stored not only for functions defined
in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode, but also for functions defined by the user in
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode.  (<code>:Program</code> mode Functions built into ACL2 still
have their <code>'unnormalized-body</code> property omitted, in order to save space.)<p>

The handling of ``invisible'' functions for purposes of controlling rewriting
(see <a href="LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>) has been moved to a new table; see <a href="INVISIBLE-FNS-TABLE.html">invisible-fns-table</a>.
Macros that access and modify this table are called
``<code>...-invisible-fns-table</code>'' in place of their former names,
``<code>...-invisible-fns-alist</code>.''  This feature was formerly implemented in
the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>, which prevented a book from exporting lists of
invisible functions intended to work with the <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules developed in
the book.  Thanks to Eric Smith and Rob Sumners for suggesting this change.
See <a href="SET-INVISIBLE-FNS-TABLE.html">set-invisible-fns-table</a> (formerly <code>set-invisible-fns-alist</code>), and also
see <a href="ADD-INVISIBLE-FNS.html">add-invisible-fns</a> and see <a href="REMOVE-INVISIBLE-FNS.html">remove-invisible-fns</a>, which provides ways to
incrementally add to and remove from this table, respectively.  The handling
of printing binary function call nests using macros
(See <a href="ADD-BINOP.html">add-binop</a>) has also been moved out of the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> as
suggested by Eric and Rob, but this feature didn't work anyhow
(see <a href="NOTE-2-7-BUG-FIXES.html">note-2-7-bug-fixes</a>).  Incidentally, the symbols <code><a href="BINOP-TABLE.html">binop-table</a></code>,
<code><a href="ADD-BINOP.html">add-binop</a></code>, and <code><a href="REMOVE-BINOP.html">remove-binop</a></code> have all been added to the list
<code>*acl2-exports*</code> (see <a href="ACL2-USER.html">acl2-user</a>), <code><a href="ADD-INVISIBLE-FNS.html">add-invisible-fns</a></code> and
<code><a href="REMOVE-INVISIBLE-FNS.html">remove-invisible-fns</a></code> have been added to that list, and
<code>set-invisible-fns-alist</code> has been replaced in that list by
<code><a href="SET-INVISIBLE-FNS-TABLE.html">set-invisible-fns-table</a></code>.  Function <code>invisible-fns-alistp</code> is no
longer defined and has been removed from <code>*acl2-exports*</code>.<p>

We now enforce the stated restriction on the pairings in
<code>macro-aliases-table</code> (see <a href="MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>), namely, that it
associates names of macros with names of funcions (with respect to the
current ACL2 logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>).  We make a similar requirement on
<code><a href="INVISIBLE-FNS-TABLE.html">invisible-fns-table</a></code>.<p>

The <code><a href="THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></code> event has been modified so that the default action
is an error rather than a warning.  Thanks to Eric Smith for suggesting this
change.  Also, the value returned upon successful execution of a
<code><a href="THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></code> event is now the key.<p>

Proof output that reports destructor elimination no longer uses the word
``generalizing''.  This small change may help in browsing proof output, since
now ``generaliz'' takes you to true uses of generalization.  Thanks to Matyas
Sustik for suggesting such a change.<p>

The command <code>:</code><code><a href="PL.html">pl</a></code> now prints an abbreviated controller-alist for
<code>;</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> rules.  Formerly the output from <code>:pl</code> could be
overwhelming when the supplied function was part of a large
<code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> nest.<p>

The defaults for keyword parameters of <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> have changed.
See <a href="NOTE-2-7-BUG-FIXES.html">note-2-7-bug-fixes</a>, in particular, the discussion there of two
modifications to <code>certify-book</code>.<p>

Technical changes have been made to <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></code> and <code><a href="COMPRESS2.html">compress2</a></code> that
should usually be invisible to users.  The next paragraph describes them in
detail, only for competeness (i.e., that description can be ignored by most
users).  But first, here is an example showing an effect on users.  The slow
array warning was not there previously.  Notice that the warning only arises
if the event form is changed.  The solution is to be sure that redundant
<code><a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></code> forms are syntactically identical.

ACL2 !&gt;(defconst *a* (compress1 'demo 
                                '((:header :dimensions (5)

                                           :name demo)
                                  (1 . one)

As before, the von Neumann structure stored in the <code>'acl2-array</code> property
of the array name contains the array list object in its <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code>.  However,
previously it was the case that <code>compress1</code> and <code>compress2</code> did not
update that <code>car</code> when its new value would be equal to its old value.  This
was done largely in support of some type-set tables defined using
<code><a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></code> in <code>type-set-b.lisp</code>.  The new versions of <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></code>
and <code><a href="COMPRESS2.html">compress2</a></code> are simpler in that no such exception is made in the case
of equal lists, although instead the entire compression process is
short-circuited when the input array list object is <code><a href="EQ.html">eq</a></code> to the <code>car</code>
of the <code>'acl2-array</code> property.  This change was made because the equality
test was causing a ``slow array access'' warning to be printed in rare cases
during proofs, as described elswhere (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-BUG-FIXES.html">note-2-7-bug-fixes</a>).<p>

We no longer distribute documentation specific to Lucid Emacs.  The Info
documentation in directory <code>doc/EMACS/</code> works well both for Gnu Emacs and
XEmacs.<p>

A little-advertised macro, <code>value</code>, has long been allowed for top-level
forms in <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>; see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>.  This has been replaced by a
new macro, <code>value-triple</code>.  The two have the same semantics at the
top-level of books, where <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> is ``live''.  However, <code>value-triple</code>
should be used at the top-level of a book, while <code>value</code> should be used in
function definitions (as before).  This change eliminates a warning put out
by the Allegro Common Lisp compiler for top-level <code>value</code> forms in
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.<p>
