<h2>NOTE-2-7</h2>ACL2 Version  2.7 (November, 2002) Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

The Version_2.7 notes are divided into the subtopics below.  Here we give
only a brief summary of a few of the changes that seem most likely to impact
existing proofs.  Not included in this brief summary, but included in the
subtopics, are descriptions of improvements (including bug fixes and new
functionality) that should not get in the way of existing proof efforts.<p>

In particular, please see <a href="NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a> for discussion of a
number of new features that you may find useful.<p>

Acknowledgements and elaboration, as well as other changes, can be found in
the subtopics listed below.<p>

o Bug fixes (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-BUG-FIXES.html">note-2-7-bug-fixes</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ Three soundness bugs were fixed.  These bugs were probably rarely hit, so
users may well not notice these changes.<p>

+ <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></code> now requires <code>:skip-proofs-ok t</code> (respectively,
<code>:defaxioms-okp t</code>) if there are <code><a href="SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></code> (respectively,
<code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code>) events in the book or any included sub-books.<p>

+ When <code>:by</code> hints refer to a definition, they now use the original body of
that definition rather than the simplfied (``normalized'') body.<p>

+ When <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> is applied to a stringp file name, it now temporarily sets the
connected book directory (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>) to the directory of that file while
evaluating forms in that file.</blockquote>
<p>

o New functionality (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ ACL2 now works harder to apply <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code>
rules with free variables in the hypotheses.  See <a href="NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a>,
in particular its first two paragraphs, for details.  <a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">Forward-chaining</a>
also does more with free variables.</blockquote>
<p>

o Changes in proof engine (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-PROOFS.html">note-2-7-proofs</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ Some prover heuristics have changed slightly.  Among other consequences,
this can cause subgoal <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> to change.  For example, suppose that the
Version_2.6 proof of a particular theorem generated "Subgoal 2" and
"Subgoal 1" while Version_2.7 only generates the second of these.  Then a
subgoal hint attached to "Subgoal 1" in Version_2.6 would have to be
attached to "Goal'" in Version_2.7.  (See <a href="GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>.)  The full topic has
details (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-PROOFS.html">note-2-7-proofs</a>).</blockquote>
<p>

o Changes in rules and definitions (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-RULES.html">note-2-7-rules</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ The package name of a generated variable has changed for <code><a href="DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></code>.</blockquote>
<p>

o Guard-related changes (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-GUARDS.html">note-2-7-guards</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ <code><a href="GUARD.html">Guard</a></code> verification formerly succeeded in a few cases where it should
have failed.<p>

+ Guards generated from type declarations now use functions
<code>signed-byte-p</code> and <code>unsigned-byte-p</code>, now defined in source file
<code>axioms.lisp</code> and formerly defined rather similarly under <code>books/ihs/</code>.</blockquote>
<p>

o Proof-checker changes (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-PROOF-CHECKER.html">note-2-7-proof-checker</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ See the above doc topic.</blockquote>
<p>

o System-level changes (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-SYSTEM.html">note-2-7-system</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ See the above doc topic.</blockquote>
<p>

o Other changes (see <a href="NOTE-2-7-OTHER.html">note-2-7-other</a>):
<blockquote><p>

+ A new <code><a href="TABLE.html">table</a></code>, <code><a href="INVISIBLE-FNS-TABLE.html">invisible-fns-table</a></code>, takes the place of the
handling of invisible functions in the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>,<p>

+ The <code><a href="THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></code> event has been modified so that the default action
is an error rather than a warning.<p>

+  Proof output that reports destructor elimination no longer uses the word
``generalizing''.</blockquote>
<p>
