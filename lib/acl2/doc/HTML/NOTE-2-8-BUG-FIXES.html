<h3>NOTE-2-8-BUG-FIXES</h3>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on Bug Fixes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="NOTE-2-8.html">NOTE-2-8</a>
</pre><p>

We have fixed a soundness bug in the tautology checker's handling of
expressions of the form <code>(not (not x))</code>.  This bug has gone back at least
as far as Version_2.4.  All of the regression tests passed after the fix,
without modification.  So we hope that this bug has rarely bitten anyone.
Thanks to Qiang Zhang for sending us a proof of <code>nil</code> that led us to this
fix: <code>(thm (equal (and p q) (not (or (not p) (not q)))))</code>.  And thanks to
Matyas Sustik for an observation that led to an improvement of our initial
fix.<p>

The preceding version (2.7) introduced a soundness bug in handling of ACL2
<a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a>, in which functions <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></code> and <code><a href="COMPRESS2.html">compress2</a></code> were
returning the input alist rather than compressing it appropriately.  Here is
a proof of <code>nil</code> that no longer succeeds, based on a bug report from Warren
Hunt, who we thank for bringing this problem to our atttention.

<pre>
(defthm bad
  (not (let* ((ar2 (aset1 'my-array ar1 3 10))
              (ar3 (compress1 'my-array ar2))
              (ar4 (reverse (reverse ar2)))
              (ar5 (compress1 'my-array ar4)))
         (and (equal ar2 ar4)
              (not (equal ar3 ar5)))))
  :rule-classes nil)
(defthm contradiction
  nil
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :use
           ((:instance bad
                       (ar1 (compress1 'my-array
                                       '((3 . 5)
                                         (:HEADER :DIMENSIONS (5)
                                                  :MAXIMUM-LENGTH 6
                                                  :DEFAULT 0
                                                  :NAME MY-ARRAY)))))))))
</pre>

On a related note, a new function <code><a href="FLUSH-COMPRESS.html">flush-compress</a></code> can be used for subtle
control of under-the-hood raw Lisp support for fast array access, although we
expect it to be very rare that users need this extra support.<p>

Previous versions have had two soundness bugs that can occur when using the
<a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>:

<blockquote>
o The first bug pertains to the <code>expand</code> command, and hence <code>x</code> and
<code>x-dumb</code> commands (which call <code>expand</code>); see <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">proof-checker-commands</a>.
The bug can occur when applying the above commands when the current term is a
call of a constrained function symbol for which there is a
<code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> rule.  Now, the <code>expand</code> command will succeed only
when the function symbol of the current term is a defined function symbol, in
which case the original definition is always used, in analogy to how the
<code>:expand</code> hint works in the prover; see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Thanks to John Erickson
for sending an example that led us to wonder if there might be a soundness
problem.<p>

o The second bug pertains to the <code>s</code> command (and commands that call it,
e.g., <code>s-prop</code>).  The proof-checker forms a context out of the top-level
hypotheses and the <code>if</code>-terms governing the current term.  If there is a
contradiction in the top-level hypotheses, the proof-checker can
appropriately consider the goal to be proved, and it does so.  But formerly,
the criterion was weaker:  the contradiction could involve the combination of
the top-level hypotheses and <code>if</code>-term governors.  Thanks to Rob Sumners
for noticing this bug.</blockquote>
<p>

A soundness bug could be provoked in some Lisps by applying <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> to
the empty string.  This has been disallowed.<p>

We fixed a soundness bug related to packages caused by a failure to track
axioms introduced <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>ly on behalf of <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> events.
See <a href="HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE.html">hidden-death-package</a>.<p>

We fixed a soundness bug caused by a failure to check that a
<code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rule can be processed when proofs are skipped or
under a <code><a href="DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a></code> event.  The former case can occur when processing an
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event, where the rule could depend
on a <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <code>:</code><code><a href="COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a></code> rule preceding the proposed
<code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rule under the same <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event.  See <a href="LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a> for such an example.<p>

We fixed a potential soundness bug relating to reclassifying a
<code>:program</code> mode function to <code>:logic</code> mode (as done by
<code><a href="VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></code> or the submission of an appropriate ``redundant''
definition) without adequate checking that <code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code> usage was identical.
Allegedly redundant definitions must now preserve the <code>stobjs</code> declaration
as well as the formals, body, guard and type declarations.  We thank
Vernon Austel for pointing out this problem.<p>

It was possible to get a raw Lisp error by introducing a <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>ly defined
function with <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> verification inhibited and then subsequently
introducing the same definition non-locally without that inhibition.  The
following example will clarify.

<pre>
(encapsulate nil
  (local
    (defun foo (x) (declare (xargs :guard t :verify-guards nil)) (car x)))
  (defun foo (x) (declare (xargs :guard t)) (car x)))
; The following causes a raw lisp error because ACL2 runs the Common Lisp
; definition of foo, because it thinks that foo's guard of t was verified.
(thm (equal (foo 3) xxx))
</pre>

Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this problem to our attention.  We are
particularly grateful to Jared because his example exploited this bug by
applying it to a function defined using <code><a href="MBE.html">mbe</a></code> (introduced in this same
version, 2.8), in order to prove <code>nil</code>!<p>

The sort of error message shown below can legitimately occur when certifying
a book in a certification world where there was an <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> command
with a relative pathname (see <a href="PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>).  However, it was occurring more
often than necessary.  This has been fixed.

<blockquote>
ACL2 Error in (CERTIFY-BOOK "foo" ...): The certification world has
include-book commands for book "bar" that correspond to different full
pathnames, namely "/u/dir1/bar" and "/u/dir2/bar".  ACL2 cannot currently
certify a book in such a world.  To work around this problem, use an absolute
pathname for at least one of these books (see :DOC pathname).</blockquote>
<p>

Bugs were fixed in <code><a href="WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></code>, in particular related to the use of
values <code>:all</code>.  Also, documentation for <code>with-output</code> has been improved.
Thanks to Vernon Austel for pointing out the bugs.<p>

Fixed a lisp error occurring when <code>bash</code> proof-checker command was given
illegal syntax, e.g., <code>(bash (("Goal" :in-theory (enable binary-append))))</code>
instead of <code>(bash ("Goal" :in-theory (enable binary-append)))</code>.<p>

We added an appropriate guard to <code><a href="FIND-RULES-OF-RUNE.html">find-rules-of-rune</a></code>, which will avoid
hard lisp errors when this function is called on non-<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> arguments.
Thanks to Eric Smith for pointing out this issue.<p>

It was possible for a redundant <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> form
(see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>) to leave a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> in the ACL2 logical
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> and to cause (re-)loading of a compiled file.  These behaviors
have been fixed.  In particular, if <code>book1</code> has already been included in
the current ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> and <code>(include-book "book1")</code> occurs in
<code>book2</code>, then the compiled file for <code>book1</code> will not be loaded again when
<code>book2</code> is included.  Thanks to Dave Greve for bringing our attention to
these problems, and to Eric Smith for bringing up a special case earlier
(where "//" occurred in the book name).<p>

The summary printed at the end of a proof had not listed <code>:</code><code><a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a></code>
rules used in a proof.  This has been corrected.<p>

The use of proof trees in emacs redefined `<code>control-c control-c</code>' in such a
way that in telnet mode, the telnet session was interrupted and perhaps could
not be continued.  This has been fixed.<p>

Source function <code>load-theory-into-enabled-structure</code> contained a
guard-violating call of <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></code>.  Thanks to Vernon Austel for
bringing this problem to our attention; even though this bug was benign
(as he pointed out), we like keeping the source code free of guard
violations.<p>

A number of proof-checker atomic macros caused a hard error when all goals
have already been proved.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to John Erickson for
sending an example of the issue.<p>

A bug has been fixed in <code><a href="ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a></code>.  Formerly, a
<code><a href="TABLE.html">table</a></code> <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> violation occurred when calling
<code><a href="ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a></code> more than once with first argument other than
<code>:clear</code>.<p>

Defininitions of functions involving large constants could cause stack
overflows.  This has been fixed, at least in some of the most egregious
cases (by making a source function <code>fn-count-evg</code> tail-recursive).  Thanks
to Jared Davis for bringing this problem to our attention.<p>

Evaluation of computed hints could cause stack overflows.  This has been
fixed.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing this problem to our attention.<p>

Evaluation of <code>:</code><code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code> on <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s is now
fast even if the specified function is part of a very large
<code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> nest.  Thanks to Eric Smith for sending an example
showing that this wasn't always the case.<p>

Fixed a bug in <code>books/bdd/cbf.lisp</code> that was causing certification of
distributed bdd books to fail when the connected book directory (see <a href="CBD.html">cbd</a>)
differs from the current working directory.  Thanks to Scott Guthery for
bringing this bug to our attention and supplying a helpful log.<p>

Duplicate rule names have been eliminated from warnings generated upon the
use of enabled <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> rules.  Thanks to
Eric Smith for pointing out this problem.<p>

The trace utilities (see <a href="TRACE.html">trace</a>), as modified for GCL and Allegro Common
Lisp, had failed to show more than the first return value for so-called
``<code>*1*</code>'' functions (essentially, <a href="EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> functions)
when they were returning multiple values (via <a href="MV.html">mv</a>).  This has been fixed.
Thanks to Erik Reeber for pointing out this problem.
Also, it is now possible to refer to <code>arglist</code> in <a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a> forms when
ACL2 is built on GCL, not just when ACL2 is built on Allegro Common Lisp.<p>

Uses of <code><a href="HIDE.html">hide</a></code> introduced during proofs by failed attempts to evaluate
constrained functions (see <a href="HIDE.html">hide</a>) are now tracked, so that the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>
<code>(:DEFINITION HIDE)</code> will show up in the summary.<p>

The following bug, introduced back in Version  2.7, has been fixed.  The bug
applied only to GCL and may well not have affected anyone.  But the function
proclamation computed by ACL2 for compilation usually had an output type of
<code>nil</code> where it should have been <code>t</code>.<p>

The macro <code><a href="GC$.html">gc$</a></code> had a bug exhibited when it was supplied one or more
arguments.  This has been fixed.<p>

The macro <code><a href="DEFABBREV.html">defabbrev</a></code> broke when supplied a string and no documentation,
e.g., <code>(defabbrev foo () "")</code>.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for noticing this
problem and providing a fix, which we have incorporated.<p>

For ACL2 executables built on Allegro Common Lisp, a Lisp error occurred when
<code><a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a></code> was called on other than a defined function symbol.  Now ACL2
prints a more useful error message.<p>

The proof-checker no longer accepts a <code>(</code><code><a href="VERIFY.html">verify</a></code><code>)</code> command when
some function symbol in the original goal no longer exists in the current
ACL2 logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Thanks to John Erickson for bringing this issue
to our attention.<p>

The function <code>ld-redefinition-action</code> may now be called by the user.
Thanks to Vernon Austel for suggesting that we remove this symbol from
the list of so-called untouchables.<p>

The handling of free variables in hypotheses (see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>) of rewrite
and linear rules had a bug that prevented some proofs from going through.
Here is a simple example, essentially provided by Diana Moisuc, who we thank
for bringing this issue to our attention.  The proof of the <code><a href="THM.html">thm</a></code> below
had failed, but now will succeed.  This particular bug prevented, for
example, the <code>:all</code> behavior from occurring when the first hypothesis of
the rule does not have free variables.  NOTE:  Now that this bug has been
fixed, you may find some proofs running much more slowly than before.  You
can use <code><a href="ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></code> to locate rules that are slowing down
your proofs because of excessive attention to free variables, and then
execute <code><a href="ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a></code> for those rules (or, just change the
rules themselves to specify <code>:once</code> in the <code>:</code><code><a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></code>).

<pre>
(defstub foo1 (* ) =&gt; *)
(skip-proofs
 (defthm aux-foo1
   (implies (and (integerp a)
                 (integerp i)
                 (equal (foo1 0)  (list 0 i)))
            (equal (foo1 a) (list 0 (+ a i))))
   :rule-classes ((:rewrite :match-free :all))))
(thm
 (implies (and (integerp i) 
               (integerp a) 
               (equal (foo1 0) (list 0 i)))
          (equal (foo1 a) (list 0 (+ a i)))))
</pre>
<p>

Formerly, creation of large arrays could cause an error in the underlying
Common Lisp implementation without helpful messages for the user.  Now, we
check Common Lisp restrictions on arrays and print a helpful error message if
they are violated, namely: each dimension must be less than the value of
Common Lisp constant <code>array-dimension-limit</code>, and the product of the
dimensions must be less than the value of Common Lisp constant
<code>array-total-size-limit</code>.  Thanks to Warren Hunt for bringing this issue to
our attention.  Note:  this change also removes a former restriction of
<code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code> array fields to size smaller than 2^28-1, provided the underlying
Lisp can support larger arrays.<p>

The <a href="DEFAULT-HINTS.html">default-hints</a> in the current logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> were ignored by
<code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code>.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Jared Davis for
pointing out this bug and sending a helpful example.<p>

The <code><a href="BRR.html">brr</a></code> mechanism has been cleaned up in order to avoid hard errors and
infinite loops that can arrive when typing interrupts (<code>control-c</code>) or
end-of-files (<code>control-d</code>) inside the <code><a href="BRR.html">brr</a></code> loop.  Thanks to Dave
Greve, Olga Matlin, Eric Smith, and Serita Van Groningen for bringing this
issue to our attention.  As a byproduct, if you type <code>control-d</code> (or if
inside emacs, <code>control-c control-d</code>), you may now quit entirely out of ACL2
and lisp (see <a href="GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a>) in some cases where you formerly would not have, for
example when sitting at the ACL2 prompt (which formerly, in Allegro Common
Lisp for example, would merely take you into raw Lisp rather than quitting
everything).<p>

We have eliminated structural flaws in the HTML documentation pages that
could make them unreadable in some browsers.  Thanks to Bill Young for
bringing this issue to our attention and to Joe Hendrix for diagnosing the
problem.<p>

The <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> could run very slowly after many instructions in a
given session.  This has been fixed; thanks to Art Flatau for bringing this
problem to our attention.  (Implementation detail: We now keep tag-trees
duplicate-free when we accumulate them into state.  This change could have
minor speed advantages for some top-level proofs too, not just in the
proof-checker.)<p>

The printing of accesses to stobjs using nth or update-nth has been done
using symbolic constants since ACL2 Version_2.6.  However, there was a bug
that prevented this feature from working for <code><a href="UPDATE-NTH.html">update-nth</a></code> except at a
top-level call.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Julien Schmaltz for bringing
this problem to our attention.  For example, consider these events:

<pre>
(defstobj st field0 field1)
(thm (equal (nth 1 (update-nth 0 17 st)) (car (cons xxx yyy)))
     :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (disable nth update-nth))))
</pre>

Before the fix, the proof attempt of the above silly thm printed the
following.

<pre>
(NTH 1 (UPDATE-NTH *FIELD0* 17 ST))
</pre>

After the fix, we instead see the following.

<pre>
(NTH *FIELD1* (UPDATE-NTH *FIELD0* 17 ST))
</pre>
<p>

It is now possible to certify and subsequently include <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> that
require guard-checking to be off.  For example, the book can contain the form
<code>(defconst *silly* (car 3))</code> even though <code>3</code> fails to satisfy the guard
of <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code>.  Formerly, it was necessary to execute
<code>:</code><code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code><code> nil</code> before a <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> or
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> in order for such a form to be handled without error.
Thanks to Hanbing Liu for bringing this problem to our attention.<p>

Fixed a <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> bug that could cause probably cause strange error,
``Attempt to access the plist field''.  Thanks to Bill Young for bringing this
problem to our attention.<p>

Fixed a <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> bug that was failing to record applications of
rewrite rules using the proof-checker's <code>:rewrite</code> command, causing the
proof summary to omit mention of that rule (for example, when using the
proof-checker's <code>:exit</code> command to generate an <code>:instructions</code> hint).
Thanks to Bill Young for pointing out this bug.<p>

Modernized some of the proof-tree emacs and infix printing stuff, thanks to
suggestions made by Camm Maguire.<p>
