<h3>NOTE-2-8-PROOF-CHECKER</h3>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on Proof-checker Changes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="NOTE-2-8.html">NOTE-2-8</a>
</pre><p>

Added new <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> commands <code>wrap1</code>, <code>wrap</code>, and
<code>wrap-induct</code>.  <code>Wrap</code> replaces multiple goals by their conjunction:
<code>(wrap instr1 instr2 ...)</code> employs <code>wrap1</code> so that the indicated
instructions create only at most one new goal.  <code>Wrap-induct</code> is a simple
example of the use of <code>wrap</code>, so that induction creates only one goal (the
conjunction of the base and induction steps).  <code>Wrap1</code> can be used
immediately after a prover call (<code>bash</code>, <code>prove</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>bdd</code>, or
<code>induct</code>) to collapse the new goals into one.  See <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">proof-checker-commands</a>.<p>

The <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command <code>=</code> failed to work as expected when a
governing <code>IF</code>-test of the current term is T.  This has been fixed (by
fixing source function <code>conjuncts-of</code>).  Thanks to Yoann Padioleau for
bringing this problem to our attention.<p>

The <code>type-alist</code> command now takes optional arguments that control whether
or not the governors and/or conclusion are used in computing the context
that is printed (see <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">proof-checker-commands</a>, specifically subtopic
<code>type-alist</code>).  Thanks to Rob Sumners for suggesting this improvement.<p>

The macro <code><a href="TOGGLE-PC-MACRO.html">toggle-pc-macro</a></code> has always taken an optional second argument
of <code>atomic-macro</code> or <code>macro</code>.  However, this was not clearly documented,
and those two symbols had to be in the <code>ACL2</code> package.  Both of these
problems have been remedied.  Thanks to John Erickson for bringing the lack
of documentation of the second argument to our attention.<p>
