<h3>NOTE-2-8-SYSTEM</h3>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on System-level Changes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="NOTE-2-8.html">NOTE-2-8</a>
</pre><p>

ACL2 now runs on OpenMCL, ``an opensourced Common Lisp implementation,
derived from Digitool's Macintosh Common Lisp product.''  Thanks to Greg
Wright and Robert Krug for doing most of the work for this port.<p>

When <code>(</code><code><a href="LP.html">LP</a></code><code>)</code> is first executed, the underlying raw Lisp package
will change to <code>"ACL2"</code> (if that is not already the current package in
raw  Lisp).  This is a minor change that will probably not be noticed, since
up to now it has probably been the case that the ACL2 executable starts up
with <code>"ACL2"</code> as the underlying raw Lisp package.  But this change was
made because we have been informed that ACL2 executables based on OpenMCL
need not start up with <code>"ACL2"</code> as the underlying raw Lisp package.<p>

ACL2 now runs on MCL 5.0.  Thanks to Pascal Costanza for updates to the
instructions in file <code>mcl-acl2-startup.lisp</code> and for an update to the
ACL2 sources (parameter <code>*compiled-file-extension*</code>).<p>
