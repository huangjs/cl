Also see <a href="NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a> for other changes since the last non-incremental release
(Version_2.9).<p>

There was a bug in non-linear arithmetic (see <a href="NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>) that
caused the following error:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(include-book "rtl/rel4/lib/top" :dir :system)

                 104))

[Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above. 
Thanks!]<p>

and UNARY-/ and the simple :rewrite rule ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-* we reduce
the conjecture to<p>

HARD ACL2 ERROR in VARIFY:  This should not have happened.  The supposed
variable, '1/8388608, is instead a constant.<p>

<p>

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  Evaluation aborted.  See :DOC wet for how
you might be able to get an error backtrace.<p>

ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>

Thanks to Robert Krug for providing a fix for the above error.<p>

Guard-checking was being inhibited (since v2-9) for calls of built-in
primitives on explicit values, e.g., <code>(car 3)</code>.  This has been fixed.<p>

Guard-related warnings could be printed during proofs (this bug was
introduced in Version_2.9.1).  These warnings have been eliminated.<p>

Compound-recognizer rules <code>natp-compound-recognizer</code> and
<code>posp-compound-recognizer</code> are now built into ACL2 for predicates
<code><a href="NATP.html">natp</a></code> and <code><a href="POSP.html">posp</a></code>, and hence have been deleted from book
<code>natp-posp.lisp</code> (where they were called <code>natp-cr</code> and <code>posp-cr</code>,
respectively).<p>

The function <code>file-clock-p</code>, which recognizes a component of the ACL2
<code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>, is now defined using <code><a href="NATP.html">natp</a></code> instead of <code><a href="INTEGERP.html">integerp</a></code>.
Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting this change.  (Technical explanation
about functions in ACL2 source file <code>axioms.lisp</code>: With a <code>file-clock</code> of
-1, the call of <code>make-input-channel</code> in <code>open-input-channel</code> will create
a channel that can't be closed; see the guard of <code>close-input-channel</code>.)<p>

(Allegro CL users only) Support is now provided for building an Allegro CL
application, provided you have an Allegro CL dynamic runtime license.  (Our
belief is that with such a license, many users can use the same application,
rather than each user needing a separate license.)  See new GNUmakefile
target <code>allegro-app</code> and file <code>build-allegro-exe.cl</code> for more
information.<p>

The new home page now contains a link to a new page <code>other-releases.html</code>,
which contains information about other ACL2 releases.  (This is in one's
local home page, but may not show up on the central ACL2 home page until the
next non-incremental release.)  Thanks to Warren Hunt for suggesting this
addition.<p>

We thank Erik Reeber for suggesting a solution to output redirection using
<code><a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></code>, which we have described at the end of its documentation.<p>

A new documentation topic fixes the flawed argument for conservativity of the
<code><a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></code> event that appears in Appendix B of Kaufmann and Moore's
paper, ``Structured Theory Development for a Mechanized Logic'' (Journal of
Automated Reasoning 26, no. 2 (2001), pp. 161-203).
See <a href="CONSERVATIVITY-OF-DEFCHOOSE.html">conservativity-of-defchoose</a>.  Thanks to John Cowles and Ruben Gamboa for
helpful feedback on drafts of this note.<p>

The solution to exercise 6.15 in <code>books/textbook/chap6/solutions.txt</code> has
been fixed.  Thanks to Aaron Smith for pointing out the problem.<p>

A new documentation topic <a href="DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">defun-sk-example</a> gives a little more help in
using <code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code> effectively.  Thanks to Julien Schmaltz for presenting
this example as a challenge.<p>

(GCL only) There is now a way to speed up GCL builds of ACL2, at the cost of
perhaps a percent or so in performance of the resulting image.  Using
<code>make</code> one supplies the following.

<pre>
LISP='gcl -eval "(defparameter user::*fast-acl2-gcl-build* t)"
</pre>
<p>

Various makefiles have been improved in several ways.

<blockquote>
(1) Parallel book certification, using GNU make's <code>-j</code> option, can be used.<p>

(2) Book certifications now stops at the first failure if <code>books/Makefile</code>
or <code>books/Makefile-generic</code> is used, and returns non-zero exit status.
However, the various make targets in the ACL2 source directory
(<code>regression</code>, <code>certify-books</code>, etc.) still continue past failures unless
you provide <code>ACL2_IGNORE=' '</code> on the <code>make</code> command line.<p>

(3) The build process has been modified (file <code>GNUmakefile</code>) so that it
stops upon a failed compile or a failed initialization.<p>

(4) The automatic dependency generation (from ``<code>make dependencies</code>'' has
been improved so that commands of the form <code>(ld "my-book.lisp")</code> in
<code>.acl2</code> files cause the appropriate depedencies to be generated.</blockquote>

Thanks to comments from several users that led to the above Makefile
improvements: Ray Richards, Doug Harper, and the Rockwell ACL2 users for (1)
and (2) (and inspiring (4)), and David Rager for (2) and (3).  In particular,
Doug Harper sent a replacement for the <code>.date</code> mechanism, which was
interfering with <code>make -n</code>; so, these files are no longer written.<p>

A mechanism has been added for saving output.  In particular, you can now
call <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> on a file with output turned off, for efficiency, and yet when
a proof fails you can then display the proof attempt for the failed (last)
event.  See <a href="SET-SAVED-OUTPUT.html">set-saved-output</a>.  Another new command --
see <a href="SET-PRINT-CLAUSE-IDS.html">set-print-clause-ids</a> -- causes subgoal numbers to be printed during
proof attempts when output is inhibited.<p>

Documentation has been added for using ACL2's makefile support to automate
the certification of collections of books.  See <a href="BOOK-MAKEFILES.html">book-makefiles</a>.<p>

Fixed a bug in <code><a href="SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a></code> that was causing hard Lisp errors.<p>

Improved <code><a href="CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a></code> to allow a <code>:frames</code> argument to specify a range
of one or more frames to be printed.  see <a href="CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a>.<p>

Fixed a bug in <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command <code>forwardchain</code>.  Thanks to
Ming-Hsiu Wang for bringing this bug to our attention.<p>

We have provided a mechanism for saving an executable image.
See <a href="SAVING-AND-RESTORING.html">saving-and-restoring</a> and see <a href="SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a>.  We have eliminated obsolete
functions <code>note-lib</code> and <code>make-lib</code>.<p>

Modified the <code><a href="GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></code> <a href="THEORY.html">theory</a> so that it contains all of the
built-in rules (in ACL2 source file <code>axioms.lisp</code>).  It had formerly failed
to include rules from some definitions and theorems near the end of
<code>axioms.lisp</code>.<p>

A new event, <code><a href="SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a></code>, allows the enforcement of
<code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>, <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>, and most other events during book development.
See <a href="SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a>.<p>

A bug has been fixed that had allowed <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> to cause a
hard Lisp error when calling <code><a href="UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></code> on ill-formed theories
after, for example:

<pre>
:set-guard-checking nil
(in-theory (union-theories '((:rewrite no-such-rule))
                           (current-theory 'ground-zero)))
</pre>

The handling of <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> checking has been modified somewhat in a way that
should only very rarely affect users.  (An ``Essay on Guard Checking'' in the
ACL2 source code explains this point to anyone interested in implementation
details.)<p>

(GCL ONLY) Removed the -dir setting in the ACL2 wrapper script for GCL.  This
should generally have no effect for most users, but it eliminates a potential
source of error down the road.<p>

Several interesting new definitions and lemmas have been added to the rtl
library developed at AMD, and incorporated into <code>books/rtl/rel4/lib/</code>.
Other book changes include a change to lemma <code>truncate-rem-elim</code> in
<code>books/ihs/quotient-remainder-lemmas.lisp</code>, as suggested by Jared Davis.<p>

The macro <code><a href="REAL_slash_RATIONALP.html">real/rationalp</a></code> may now be referred to in <code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code>
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> and <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>, thanks to a new <code><a href="ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a></code> event.
Thanks to Jared Davis for this suggestion.<p>

ACL2 terms of the form <code>(if p 'nil 't)</code> are now printed as <code>(not p)</code>,
where in some setting they had been printed as <code>(and (not p) t)</code>.  Thanks
to Robert Krug for this improvement.<p>

(GCL ONLY) Added profiling support, based heavily on code supplied by Camm
Maguire.  See file <code>save-gprof.lsp</code> for instructions.  Thanks to Camm, and
also to David Hardin for inspiring this addition.<p>

Added support for preprocessing before printing (untranslating) a term.
See <a href="USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS-TABLE.html">user-defined-functions-table</a>, in particular the discussion of
<code>untranslate-preprocess</code>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for inspiring this
addition, and for providing a book that takes advantage of it
(<code>books/misc/untranslate-patterns.lisp</code>).<p>

The documentation has been improved for explaining how <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s are
assigned; see <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for pointing out inaccuracies in
the existing documentation.<p>
