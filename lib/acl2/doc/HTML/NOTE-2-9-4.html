<h2>NOTE-2-9-4</h2>ACL2 Version  2.9.4 (February, 2006) Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

Also see <a href="NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a>, see <a href="NOTE-2-9-2.html">note-2-9-2</a>, and see <a href="NOTE-2-9-3.html">note-2-9-3</a> for other changes
since the last non-incremental release (Version_2.9).<p>

A soundness bug has been fixed that was due to inadequate checking of
<code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code> rules in the presence of <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.
Specifically, a <code>local</code> <code><a href="DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></code> event is insufficient for
supporting a <code>:meta</code> rule (an example is shown in source function
<code>chk-acceptable-rules</code>).  Thanks to Dave Greve and Jared Davis for bringing
this bug to our attention, by sending a proof of <code>nil</code> that exploited this
bug.  The fix is to check legality of <code>:meta</code> rules even when skipping
proofs during an <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> event or the second pass of an
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event.<p>

Fixed problem with parallel make for workshop books by adding a dependency
line to <code>books/workshops/2003/Makefile</code>.<p>

Default hints (see <a href="SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a>) no longer prevent the use of
<code>:INSTRUCTIONS</code> (see <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>).  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing
out this problem.<p>

New functions <code><a href="REMOVE-EQ.html">remove-eq</a></code> and <code><a href="REMOVE-EQUAL.html">remove-equal</a></code> have been defined, in
analogy to <code><a href="REMOVE.html">remove</a></code>.  These two symbols have also been added to
<code>*acl2-exports*</code>.  Thanks to David Rager for pointing out that
<code>remove-equal</code> was missing.  Moreover, the definitions of <code>delete1-eq</code>
and <code>delete1-equal</code> have been eliminated.  Function <code>remove1-eq</code>, now in
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode in source file <code>axioms.lisp</code>, serves in place of
<code>delete1-eq</code>, with corresponding new function definitions for <code><a href="REMOVE1.html">remove1</a></code>
and <code><a href="REMOVE1-EQUAL.html">remove1-equal</a></code>.<p>

The symbol <code><a href="ASSERT$.html">assert$</a></code> has been added to <code>*acl2-exports*</code>.  Thanks to
Jared Davis for the suggestion.<p>

Added SBCL support.  Thanks to Juho Snellman for significant assistance with
the port.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for suggesting the use of feature
<code>:acl2-mv-as-values</code> with SBCL, which can allow thread-level parallelism
in the underlying lisp; we have done so when feature <code>:sb-thread</code> is
present.<p>

We have continued to incorporate suggestions for wording improvements in
documentation and error messages.  Thanks to all who send these suggestions,
especially to Eric Smith, who has suggested the vast majority of them.<p>

Made a small improvement to errors and warnings caused on behalf of
<a href="SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a>, to indicate when an event of the same name
already exists.<p>

Fixed a bug in <code>books/misc/rtl-untranslate.lisp</code> that was causing a guard
violation when adding a new entry for an existing key.<p>

Fixed a bug in translation to internal form that caused <code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code> and
<code><a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></code> to have difficulties handling ignored variables in <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code>
forms.  Thanks to Sandip Ray to bringing this issue to our attention with a
helpful example.<p>

The form <code>(push :acl2-mv-as-values *features*)</code> has been added in source
file <code>acl2-init.lisp</code> for SBCL and OpenMCL only, in order to support
parallel execution (looking to the future...).<p>

Default-hints (see <a href="SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a>) were being ignored inside the
<a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>, but no longer.  Thanks to John Erickson for bringing this
problem to our attention and providing a simple example of it.<p>

Modified the <code>TAGS</code> <code>"make"</code> target (specifically, function
<code>make-tags</code>) so that it is gracefully skipped if the <code>etags</code> program is
not found.  Thanks to David Rager for pointing out this issue.<p>

Sandip Ray has re-worked the supporting materials for his ACL2 Workshop 2003
talk (originally with John Matthews and Mark Tuttle), to run in a few
minutes.  The result is in <code>workshops/2003/ray-matthews-tuttle/support/</code>
and is included in the full ACL2 regression suite.  Thanks, Sandip.<p>

Debian releases of ACL2 had created superfluous <code>.cert.final</code> files when
certifying books.  This has been fixed; thanks to Jared Davis for noticing
this problem.<p>

Jared Davis has pointed out that ``If you add a <code>:backchain-limit-lst 0</code> to
a rewrite rule whose hypotheses are all forced, then ACL2 `really assumes them'
without trying to relieve them right there through rewriting.''  Relevant
documentation has been added for <code>:backchain-limit-lst</code>; see <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.<p>

A new version of the rtl library has been included in <code>books/rtl/rel5/</code>.
Thanks to David Russinoff for contributing hand proofs for the new lemmas,
and to Matt Kaufmann for carrying out their mechanization.<p>

Fixed a bug in <code><a href="SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></code> that was failing to set the initial <code>cbd</code>
according to the current directory when starting up ACL2.  Thanks to Camm
Maguire for bringing our attention to this problem.<p>

Variables introduced during <code>let*</code> abstraction are now in the current
package.  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting such a change.
See <a href="SET-LET_star_-ABSTRACTIONP.html">set-let*-abstractionp</a>.<p>

It is now allowed for two definitions to be considered the same from the
standpoint of redundancy (see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>) when one specifies a
<code>:</code><code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a></code> of <code>t</code> and the other has no explicit <code>:guard</code> (hence,
the guard is implicitly <code>t</code>).  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this
issue to our attention.<p>

(For users of <code>emacs/emacs-acl2.el</code>) There have been a few enhancements to
distributed file <code>emacs/emacs-acl2. el</code> (skip this paragraph if you don't
use that file):

<blockquote>
o <code>Control-t q</code> continues to compare windows ignoring whitespace, but now,
   a prefix argument can be given to control case is also ignored (ignore case if
   positive, else use case). <p>

o <code>Control-t Control-l</code> has been defined to be similar to <code>Control-t l</code>,
   except that proofs are skipped and output is suppressed.<p>

o <code>Control-t u</code> has been defined to print, to the shell buffer, a
  <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT_bang_.html">ubt!</a></code> form for the command containing the cursor.<p>

o Control-t Control-f buries the current buffer.<p>

o <code>Meta-x new-shell</code> now puts the new shell buffer in <code>shell-mode</code>
  (thanks to David Rager for noticing this issue).</blockquote>
<p>

Linear arithmetic has been modified so that we do not generate the equality
<code>(equal term1 term2)</code> from the pair of inequalities <code>(&lt;= term1 term2)</code>
and <code>(&lt;= term2 term1)</code> in the case that we would have to <code><a href="FORCE.html">force</a></code> both
<code>term1</code> and <code>term2</code> to be <code><a href="ACL2-NUMBERP.html">acl2-numberp</a></code>s.  Thanks to Dave Greve for
providing a motivating example and to Robert Krug for providing a fix.<p>

The event <code><a href="DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">delete-include-book-dir</a></code> had not been allowed inside
<a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> and <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> forms.  This was an oversight, and has been
fixed.<p>

Sandip Ray has contributed a new library of books to support proofs of
partial and total correctness of sequential programs based on assertional
reasoning, in <code>books/symbolic/</code>.  This work is based on the paper
J. Matthews, J S. Moore, S. Ray, and D. Vroon, ``A Symbolic Simulation
Approach to Assertional Program Verification,'' currently in draft form.
In particular, the books include the macro <code>defsimulate</code>, which
automatically transforms inductive assertion proofs of correctness of
sequential programs to the corresponding interpreter proofs.  See the
<code>README</code> in that directory.<p>

We have changed the implementation of <code>:dir :system</code> for <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> and
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  This change will not affect you if you build an ACL2
executable in the normal manner, leaving in place the <code>books/</code> subdirectory
of the source directory; nor will it affect you if you download a GCL Debian
binary distribution.  The change is that if environment variable
<code>ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</code> is set, then it specifies the distributed books
directory, i.e., the directory determined by <code>:dir :system</code>.  You may find
it convenient to set this variable in your ACL2 script file (typically,
<code>saved_acl2</code>).  If it is set when you build ACL2, the generated script for
running ACL2 will begin by setting <code>ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</code> to that value.
Thanks to various people who have discussed this issue, in particular Jared
Davis who sent an email suggesting consideration of the use of an environment
variable, and to Eric Smith who helped construct this paragraph.  (Note that
this use of <code>ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</code> replaces the use of <code>ACL2_SRC_BOOKS</code>
described previously; see <a href="NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a>.)<p>

ACL2 now automatically deletes files <code>TMP*.lisp</code> created during the build
process and created by <code>:</code><code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code>.  If you want these to be saved,
evaluate <code>(assign keep-tmp-files t)</code> in the ACL2 loop or in raw Lisp.  The
<code>clean</code> target for the standard <code>make</code> process for certifying books
(see <a href="BOOK-MAKEFILES.html">book-makefiles</a>) will however delete all files <code>TMP*.*</code>.<p>

The <code>TMP</code> files discussed just above now generally include the current process
ID in their names, e.g., <code>TMP@16388@1.lisp</code> instead of <code>TMP1.lisp</code>.
Thanks to Bob Boyer for suggesting this measure, which will reduce the
possibility that two different processes will attempt to access the same
temporary file.<p>

Now, <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> will print the information formerly printed by <code>:pe!</code>,
slightly enhanced to work for logical names that are strings, not just
symbols.  Thanks to Warren Hunt for leading us to this change by suggesting
that <code>:pe nth</code> print the definition of <code><a href="NTH.html">nth</a></code>.<p>

We eliminated spurious warnings that could occur in raw mode in OpenMCL or
CMUCL when <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s are present.  We thank Juho Snellman for pointing out
the relevant bug and appropriate fix.<p>

<code>Mfc-rw</code> now takes a third argument that can specify an arbitrary known
equivalence relation; see <a href="EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>.  Thanks to Dave Greve for
discussions suggesting this improvement.<p>

A small modification to a symbol-reading function allows documentation string
processing on Windows systems that use CR/LF for line breaks.  Thanks to
William Cook for bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

The documentation has been improved on how to control the printing of ACL2
terms.  See <a href="USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS-TABLE.html">user-defined-functions-table</a>.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for asking a
question that led to the example presented there.<p>

We fixed an inefficiency that could cause an <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> command to seem to hang
at its conclusion.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for pointing out this problem.<p>

We checked that ACL2 runs under Lispworks 4.4.5 (last checked before 4.3),
and have inhibited redefinition warnings.<p>

Two changes have been made on behalf of congruence-based reasoning.  Thanks
to Dave Greve for examples and discussions that have led to these changes,
and to Eric Smith and Vernon Austel, who also sent relevant examples.

<blockquote>
o When a call of the new unary function <code><a href="DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></code> is encountered
by the rewriter, its argument will be rewritten twice.  This solves certain
problems encountered in congruence-based rewriting.  Warnings for
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> rules will suggest when calls of
<code><a href="DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></code> on variables in hypotheses are likely to be a good idea.
See <a href="DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a>.<p>

o Hypotheses of the form <code>(equiv var (double-rewrite term))</code>, where
<code>equiv</code> is a known <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation and <code>var</code> is a free variable
(see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), will bind <code>var</code> to the result of rewriting <code>term</code>
twice.  Previously, hypotheses of the form <code>(equal var term)</code> would bind a
free variable <code>var</code>, but the call had to be of <code>equal</code> rather than of an
arbitrary known equivalence relation.</blockquote>
<p>

The following improvements were made in support of ACL2 on top of OpenMCL.

<blockquote><p>

o New versions of OpenMCL that do not have <code>:mcl</code> in Lisp variable
<code>*features*</code> will now work with ACL2.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing
this issue to our attention.<p>

o Added support for OpenMCL 1.0 for 64-bit DarwinPPC/MacOS X, thanks to
Robert Krug.<p>

o Fixed tracing in OpenMCL so that the level is reset to 1 even if there has
been an abort.<p>

o Added support in OpenMCL for <code>WET</code> (see <a href="WET.html">wet</a>).<p>

o Incorporated suggestions from Gary Byers for printing the ``Welcome to
OpenMCL'' prompt before initially entering the ACL2 loop and, and for setting
useful environment variable <code>CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</code> in the ACL2
script.</blockquote>
<p>

Fixed a long-standing bug in forward-chaining, where variable-free hypotheses
were being evaluated even if the <a href="EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a>s of their
function symbols had been disabled.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing this
bug to our attention by sending a simple example that exhibited the problem.<p>

Improved reporting by the <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> utility upon failure to relieve
hypotheses in the presence of free variables, so that information is shown
about the attempting bindings.  See <a href="FREE-VARIABLES-EXAMPLES-REWRITE.html">free-variables-examples-rewrite</a>.  Thanks
to Eric Smith for requesting this improvement.  Also improved the
<a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> loop so that terms, in particular from unifying
substitutions, are printed without hiding subterms by default.  The user can
control such hiding (``evisceration''); see <a href="SET-BRR-TERM-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-brr-term-evisc-tuple</a>.<p>

A new directory <code>books/defexec/</code> contains books that illustrate the use of
<code><a href="MBE.html">mbe</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFEXEC.html">defexec</a></code>.  Thanks to the contributors of those books (see
the <code>README</code> file in that directory).<p>

The directories <code>books/rtl/rel2</code> and <code>books/rtl/rel3</code> are no longer
distributed.  They are still available by email request.  (Subdirectory
<code>rel1/</code> supports some of the optional <code>workshop/</code> books, so it is still
distributed.)<p>

Added book <code>books/misc/sticky-disable.lisp</code> to manage <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> that
might otherwise be modified adversely by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  Thanks to Ray
Richards for a query that led to our development of this tool.<p>

The commands <code>(exit)</code> and <code>(quit)</code> may now be used to quit ACL2 and Lisp
completely; in fact they macroexpand to calls of the same function as does
<code><a href="GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a></code> (which is now a macro).  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting
the new aliases.  (OpenMCL-only comment:) These all work for OpenMCL even
inside the ACL2 loop.<p>

The macro <code><a href="WET.html">wet</a></code> now hides structure by default on large expressions.
However, a new optional argument controls this behavior, for example avoiding
such hiding if that argument is <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="WET.html">wet</a>.  Thanks to Hanbing Liu for
pointing out that <code>wet</code> was not helpful for very large terms.<p>

We have fixed a bug in the forward-chaining mechanism that, very rarely,
could cause a proof to be aborted needlessly with an obscure error message.
Thanks to Jared Davis for sending us an example that evoked this bug.<p>

Fixed a bug that was causing proof output on behalf of
<code>:functional-instance</code> to be confusing, because it failed to mention that
the number of constraints may be different from the number of subgoals
generated.  Thanks to Robert Krug for pointing out this confusing output.
The fix also causes the reporting of rules used when silently simplifying the
constraints to create the subgoals.<p>

Fixed a bug in handling of leading <code>./</code> in pathnames, as in:
<code>(include-book "./foo")</code>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this bug to
our attention.<p>

Made a small fix for handling of free variables of <code>:</code><a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a>
rules, which had erroneously acted as though a hypothesis
<code>(equal var term)</code> can bind the variable <code>var</code>.<p>

A small change has been made for <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rules for
hypotheses of the form <code>(equal var term)</code>, where c[var] is a free variable
and no variable of <code>term</code> is free (see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>).  As with
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> rules, we now bind <code>var</code> to
<code>term</code> even if <code>(equal u term)</code> happens to be known in the current
context for some term <code>u</code>.  Also as with <code>:rewrite</code> and <code>:linear</code>
rules, similar handling is given to hypotheses
<code>(equiv var (double-rewrite term))</code> where <code>equiv</code> is a known
<a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation.<p>

We changed the handling of free variables in hypotheses of <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>
rules being handled by the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>'s <code>rewrite</code> (<code>r</code>) command,
in complete analogy to the change described just above for
<code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rules.<p>

The installation instructions have been updated for obtaining GCL on a
Macintosh.  Thanks to Robert Krug for supplying this information and to Camm
Maguire for simplifying the process by eliminating the <code>gettext</code>
dependency.<p>

The macro <code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code> is now an event, so it may be placed in <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.<p>

Previously, a <code><a href="SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></code> call could fail because of file permission
issues, yet ACL2 (and the underlying Lisp) would quit anyhow.  This has been
fixed.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger for bringing this problem to our attention.<p>

Jared Davis, with assistance from David Rager, has updated his ordered sets
library, <code>books/finite-set-theory/osets/</code>.  See file <code>CHANGES.html</code> in
that directory.<p>

A new function, <code><a href="RESET-KILL-RING.html">reset-kill-ring</a></code>, has been provided for the rare user
who encounters memory limitations.  See <a href="RESET-KILL-RING.html">reset-kill-ring</a>.<p>
