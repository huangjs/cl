<h2>NOTE-2-9-5</h2>Changes in Version  3.0 since Version  2.9.4
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

Fixed a bug in <code><a href="CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a></code> that was causing a hard error when attempting
to report on a forced assumption.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing this
out and sending an example that helped us to determine a fix.<p>

Added <code><a href="SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a></code> to the set of legal <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that can be
placed in <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> forms and <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  Thanks to John Cowles for
bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

Fixed a bug that broke <code><a href="WET.html">wet</a></code>.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing this
bug to our attention.<p>

Guard verification now evaluates ground subexpressions (those with no free
variables) when computing the guard conjecture for the body of a function.
Thanks to Jared Davis for useful conversations leading to this change.
See <a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>, in particular its ``Note on computation of guard
conjectures and evaluation'' near the end of that topic, for more details.<p>

Added a warning when a <code><a href="THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></code> is redefined.  Thanks to Jared
Davis for suggesting a warning in this case and providing an informative
example.  Also, <code><a href="THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></code>s are now maintained more completely,
as they are checked at the end of every event except for events executed on
behalf of an <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> or the second pass of an
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>.<p>

Fixed the handling of runic designators to match their specification
(see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>), so that disabling the name of a <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event
<code><a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a></code>s all rules generated for that event.<p>

(For those who do numerous builds using feature <code>:acl2-mv-as-values</code>,
currently only OpenMCL and multi-threaded SBCL by default:) You can speed up
builds by adding the following parameter to <code>make</code>, under conditions
described in <code>GNUmakefile</code>: <code>USE_ACL2_PROCLAIMS=:REUSE</code>.<p>

Arranged that traced functions (see <a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a>) are automatically untraced when
events are undone (for example see <a href="UBT.html">ubt</a>), at least for most underlying Common
Lisp implementations.<p>

The macro <code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code> now creates non-executable functions, which allows
<code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code>s to be used where they had previously been prohibited.  More
generally, the user now has control over <code><a href="DECLARE.html">declare</a></code> forms to be used by
the underlying <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>'d function; see <a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a>.  Thanks to Sandip for
pointing out the need for such a modification.<p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">Definition</a></code> rules are now treated, at least by default, as truly
first-class definitions.  In particular, <code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> use the
latest <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> rule by default.  You may specify
<code>:install-body nil</code> to get the previous behavior of <code>:definition</code> rules;
See <a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a>, and you may choose a previously-installed <code>:definition</code>
rule to provide the current body; see <a href="SET-BODY.html">set-body</a>.  Also see <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for
details of the <code>:install-body</code> field, and see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> to see a new <code>:with</code>
directive for controlling expansion.  The <code>:with</code> directive for <code>:expand</code>
hints can even direct the use of a <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rule for expansion!
Thanks to various people, including Sandip Ray and Rob Sumners, for
discussions on the issue of the applicability of <code>:definition</code> rules for
<code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

<a href="CONSTRAINT.html">Constraint</a>s for functional instantiation now use the original definition
rather than a simplified (``normalized'') version of it.<p>

Fixed a bug that caused the prompt to stay the same when guard-checking is
off (see <a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>) and raw-mode is changed (see <a href="SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>).<p>

Lemma names in directory <code>books/ordinals</code> have been changed by replacing
<code>/\</code> with <code>&amp;</code> and replacing <code>\/</code> with <code>V</code>.  We made this change
because backslash is an escape character and hence disappears unless it is
itself escaped.<p>

Fixed <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> output so that failed non-proof events do not cause the
proof-tree to be re-printed.  Thus for example, if you have already advanced
the checkpoint marker, it will not be reset by subequent failed non-proof
events.  Thanks to Pete Manolios and Peter Dillinger for bringing this bug to
our attention.<p>

Fixed a bug that was preventing the printing of <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a> fields as
constants instead of numbers in certain cases.  (Note that this bug only
affected printing, not soundness.) Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing this
problem to our attention and providing the following example (which now works
fine).

<pre>
(defstobj st fld1 fld2)
(in-theory (disable update-nth))
(defund run (st)
  (declare (xargs :stobjs (st))) ;adding this didn't seem to help..
  st)<p>

;works great; *fld1* prints as  *fld1*
(thm (equal (update-nth *fld1* 'abc st)
            (car (cons x y))))<p>

;*fld1* gets printed as 0, presumably because the call to run intervenes.
(thm (equal (update-nth *fld1* 'abc (run st))
            (car (cons x y))))
</pre>
<p>

The macro <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> now allows the use of macros defined within its bodies
even when at the event level, as illustrated by the following example.

<pre>
(progn (defmacro my-defun (&amp;rest args)
         `(defun ,@args))
       (my-defun g (x) x))
</pre>

Thanks to Anna Slobodova for bringing this issue to our attention.  A related
change is that all arguments of <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> must now be embedded event forms
(see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>), so use <code><a href="ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a></code> instead if this is not the
case.<p>

The change to <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> mentioned above also fixes a bug in handling
<a href="LOCAL.html">local</a> events inside a <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> that is inside an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or
in a book.  For example, the following form formerly caused an error.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 ()
 (defun foo (x) x)
 (progn (local (defun bar (x) x))
        (defun abc (x) x)))
</pre>
<p>

We fixed two bugs in <code>:</code><code><a href="PUFF.html">puff</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="PUFF_star_.html">puff*</a></code>.  The first,
brought to our attention by Eric Smith (who we thank), caused a cryptic error
message when puffing a command with no subsidiary stored events; try, for
example, <code>(encapsulate () (value-triple 3))</code>.  The second was due to a
failure to restore the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>.  Suppose for example that
we have certified the book <code>foo.lisp</code>, which contains
<code>(</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code><code>)</code> followed by some definitions and/or theorems.  Now
suppose we start ACL2 and execute the following.

<pre>
(include-book "foo")
(defthm test-thm
  (equal x x)
  :rule-classes nil)
</pre>

If we now execute <code>:</code><code><a href="PUFF.html">puff</a></code><code> 1</code>, ACL2 will roll back the world to
before the <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>; then ``puff'' the include-book, which will
leave us in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode; and finally skip re-execution of the
<code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> because such <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> are skipped in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode.
The fix is to re-install the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> immediately after the
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> to its pre-<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> value.<p>

A new event, <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code>, provides something like macros that take
state.  For example, one can use it to put tests into certified books, do
proof search, and generate new function names.  Many examples appear in
directory <code>books/make-event/</code>.  See <a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>.  Thanks to Bob Boyer and
Jared Davis for useful feedback and to Warren Hunt, David Rager, and Sandip
Ray for helpful discussions leading to some of the examples in directory
<code>books/make-event/</code>.<p>

In support of <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code>, which is described in the preceding
paragraph, <code>certify-book</code> has a new keyword argument, <code>:save-expansion</code>,
that controls whether the result of expanding <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code> forms is
written out to a file.  See <a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>; and for a discussion of book
expansion files, see <a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>.<p>

We fixed a soundness bug that did not correctly detect <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> events.
For example, the following event was admitted.

<pre>
(encapsulate
 ()
 (local
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (local (progn (program))) ; or, (local (with-output :off summary (program)))
   (set-irrelevant-formals-ok t)
   (defun foo (x)
     (declare (xargs :measure (acl2-count x)))
     (1+ (foo x)))))
 (defthm inconsistent
   nil
   :hints (("Goal" :use foo))
   :rule-classes nil))
</pre>
<p>

A new value for <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> checking, <code>:none</code>, is now allowed.  If you
execute <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code><code> :none</code>, then no guard checking will
take place (but raw Lisp code will not be executed in this case).  As a
result, you should never see a guard violation, even for calls of
<code>:</code><code>program</code> mode functions.  We thank Pete Manolios, who has long wanted
this feature, and also Peter Dillinger, for asking for it.  New documentation
explains the interaction between the <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and the value supplied
to <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code>.  See <a href="GUARD-EVALUATION-TABLE.html">guard-evaluation-table</a>,
see <a href="GUARD-EVALUATION-EXAMPLES-SCRIPT.html">guard-evaluation-examples-script</a>, and
see <a href="GUARD-EVALUATION-EXAMPLES-LOG.html">guard-evaluation-examples-log</a>.<p>

In the course of adding the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>-checking value <code>:none</code> described in
the paragraph above, we eliminated an optimization that eliminated guard
checking for some recursive calls of <code>:</code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a> mode mutually-recursive
functions that have not had their guards verified.  But we doubt that this
change will be noticed by any users!)<p>

The ACL2 hyper-card has been enhanced, thanks to David Rager, with a listing
of ``Useful EMACS Commands'' to match comments in <code>emacs/emacs-acl2.el</code>.<p>

Users contributed books following the <code>Readme.lsp</code> methodology:
<code>data-structures/memories</code> and <code>unicode</code> (Jared Davis), <code>proofstyles</code>
(Sandip Ray and J Moore).<p>

Made some improvements to <code>books/Makefile-generic</code> (a file discussed
elsewhere; see <a href="BOOK-MAKEFILES.html">book-makefiles</a>).  In particular, improved handling of
<code>.acl2</code> files for <code>dependencies</code> target.<p>

(Only OpenMCL and, with feature <code>:acl2-mv-as-values</code>, GCL) Fixed a bug that
was causing proclaiming to fail when definitions are submitted interactively.<p>

The default stack size has been increased for several lisps.<p>

(Very technical) A restriction has been weakened on the use of <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>
<a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s under a call of an ACL2 evaluator (<code>trans-eval</code> or
<code>simple-translate-and-eval</code>).  Now, the error can only take place for
<code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code> names that occur in the term being evaluated.  Thanks to Erik
Reeber for bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

The notion of ``ancestor'' has been changed slightly.  This notion is used by
extended metafunctions and <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> (see <a href="EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>
and see <a href="BRR_at_.html">brr@</a>), and also with backchain limits (see <a href="BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> and
see <a href="SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a>).  Basically, each time a hypothesis is encountered
during application of a <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule, that hypothesis is pushed (after
instantiating and negating) onto the current list of ancestors before it is
rewritten.  However, hypotheses of the form <code>(equal var term)</code>, where
<code>var</code> is free (see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), had not been included in the ancestors
(similarly for <code>(equiv var (double-rewrite term))</code> where <code>equiv</code> is a
known <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation).  Now such ``binding hypotheses'' are
included in a special way in ancestors data structures.  In particular,
<code>(null (mfc-ancestors mfc))</code> will now be true if and only if the term being
rewritten is part of the current goal as opposed to a hypothesis from a rule
encountered during backchaining, even if that hypothesis is a binding
hypothesis.  Thanks to Dave Greve for bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

Termination and induction analysis now continue through both arguments of
<code><a href="PROG2$.html">prog2$</a></code>, not just the second.  (Normally, the gathering up of <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code>
tests stops at function calls; but it continued through the second argument
of <code><a href="PROG2$.html">prog2$</a></code>, and now it will continue through both arguments.)  Thanks to
Sol Swords for discussion leading to this change.<p>

The ACL2 distribution is now kept on the http server rather than the ftp
server (but the home page has not been moved).  Thanks to Robert Krug for
letting us know that some ACL2 users have found it inconvenient to fetch ACL2
using ftp.<p>

The file <code>books/README.html</code> has been renamed to <code>books/Readme.html</code>,
since some browsers don't show the former in the directory listing.<p>
