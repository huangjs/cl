<strong>BUG FIXES.</strong><p>

We fixed a soundness bug due to a conflict between user-supplied package
names and internal package names (obtained by prepending a Lisp constant,
<code>*1*-package-prefix*</code>) and user-supplied package names.  For example, the
form <code>(defpkg "ACL2_*1*_MYPKG" ())</code> is no longer legal.  Thanks to Robert
Krug for asking a question that led directly to the discovery of this bug.<p>

We fixed a soundness bug that allows <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode functions to call
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode functions.  The fix furthermore prevents functions
with <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s verified from calling functions with guards not verified.
We had thought we already prevented all this, but there was a problem with
the interaction of <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> definitions and redundancy checking
(see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>).<p>

We fixed a soundness bug that could occur when built-in functions were called
during macroexpansion (a hole in so-called ``safe-mode'').<p>

Fixed a minor bug in system functions <code>genvar1</code> and <code>genvar</code>, where
<code><a href="EQ.html">eq</a></code> had been used in place of <code><a href="EQL.html">eql</a></code>.  This bug was discovered during
the plugging of a hole in safe-mode, mentioned just above.<p>

We fixed handling of the <code>:inline</code> keyword for <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code>, which
previously could cause raw Lisp errors in OpenMCL and CMU Common Lisp.
Thanks to John Matthews for bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

Calls of <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> could result in a state for which some function
definitions were not compiled that should have been.  The result could be
performance degradation or even stack overflows.  This situation could arise
in the following two ways.
<blockquote><p>

o Inclusion of a book with an absolute pathname that differs from the
absolute pathname at certification time, presumably because of the use of
soft links.  Thanks to Bob Boyer and Warren Hunt for bringing a stack
overflow to our attention that led us to this fix.<p>

o Large <code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> nests (more than 20 functions) are executed
in a superior book.<p>

</blockquote>

We fixed some performance bugs that can increase the speed of
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> calls by a factor of close to 2.  Thanks to Eric Smith for
asking if we could speed up <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> processing; we have done so in
the past, but primarily focusing on large <code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> nests (which
have nothing in particular to do with the current improvements).  Also,
thanks to Rob Sumners for a very useful remark early in the process that kept
us from drawing an incorrect conclusion at that point.<p>

We fixed <code>:</code><code><a href="PL.html">pl</a></code> so that it can be run on a form that returns multiple
values, which it could not do previouslly.  Thanks to Eric Smith for pointing
out this problem.<p>

Fixed a bug in the Allegro ACL2 trace utility (see <a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a>) that was causing
``<code>10&gt;</code>'' to be printed as ``<code>9&gt;</code>'', ``<code>11&gt;</code>'' to be printed as
``<code>10 &gt;</code>'', ``<code>12&gt;</code>'' to be printed as ``<code>11 &gt;</code>'', and so on.<p>

Fixed a <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> bug that was preventing the use of the <code>DV</code>
command (or a numerical command) on <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code> expressions.  Thanks to Bill
Young for pointing out this problem.<p>

Fixed a bug in a comment on how to set <code>ACL2_BOOKS_DIR</code> in the makefile.
Thanks to Dave Greve for pointing out this problem.<p>

Fixed a potential soundness bug in the linear arithmetic routines.  Thanks to
Jared Davis for noticing this problem and to Robert Krug for implementing the
fix.  (Technical details: We had been assuming that polynomials were being
normalized -- see the definition of good-polyp in linear-a.lisp -- but this
assumption was false.)<p>

When the macro <code><a href="OPEN-TRACE-FILE.html">open-trace-file</a></code> is opened twice in succession, it now
automatically closes the first trace output channel before opening another.<p>

It is now possible to use <code>make</code> to build ACL2 on Windows systems that
support <code>make</code>.  Thanks to Pete Manolios and Mike Thomas for pointing out
the problem, to Jared Davis and Mike for helping us to analyze the problem,
and to Jared for testing the fix.<p>

Fixed a bug in the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> of <code><a href="WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></code> that was causing a
needless guard violation.<p>

<strong>NEW FUNCTIONALITY.</strong><p>

The new events <code><a href="ADD-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">add-default-hints</a></code> and <code><a href="REMOVE-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">remove-default-hints</a></code> allow
one to append to or subtract from the current list of default hints.  The
event <code><a href="SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a></code> continues to set the list of default hints,
discarding the previous value of the <code><a href="DEFAULT-HINTS.html">default-hints</a></code>.  Note that
<code><a href="SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a></code> is still <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> to the <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or book
in which it occurs, and <code><a href="ADD-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">add-default-hints</a></code> has the same property,
although neither is implemented any longer using the
<code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>.  New events <code><a href="ADD-DEFAULT-HINTS_bang_.html">add-default-hints!</a></code>,
<code><a href="REMOVE-DEFAULT-HINTS_bang_.html">remove-default-hints!</a></code>, and <code><a href="SET-DEFAULT-HINTS_bang_.html">set-default-hints!</a></code> are the same as
<code><a href="ADD-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">add-default-hints</a></code>, <code><a href="REMOVE-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">remove-default-hints</a></code>, and
<code><a href="SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a></code>, respectively, except that the former three events
are not <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> to their enclosing <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or book.  Thanks to
Jared Davis for suggesting these enhancements.<p>

OpenMCL's tracing routines have been modified in a similar manner as those
of Allegro CL.  Thanks to Robert Krug for providing this enhancement.<p>

Guard-checking can now be caused to happen on recursive calls.
See ``GUARD-RELATED CHANGES'' below for details.<p>

Advanced users can now inhibit compilation of so-called ``*1* functions''
with the <code>:comp</code> command; see <a href="COMP.html">comp</a>.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for suggesting
this enhancement.<p>

Added new legal argument <code>hard?</code> for the <code><a href="ER.html">er</a></code> macro, which is now
documented.  See <a href="ER.html">er</a>.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for a discussion leading to this
change.  Also, the three legal first arguments to <code><a href="ER.html">er</a></code> -- <code>hard</code>,
<code>hard?</code>, and <code>soft</code> -- may now be in any package (thanks to Jared Davis
for bringing this issue to our attention).<p>

We have removed the requirement that for a rule's hypothesis
<code>(bind-free term var-list)</code>, at least one variable must occur free in
<code>term</code>.  For example, the expression <code>(bind-free (bind-divisor a b) (x))</code>
was legal because <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> occur free in <code>(bind-divisor a b)</code>; but
<code>(bind-free (foo (bar)) (x))</code> was not legal.  The latter is no longer
disallowed. (Technical note: this allows <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code> to be used to create
explicit substitutions in metafunction hypotheses.)<p>

The following two enhancements have been implemented for rules of class
<code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for requesting more control of
reasoning with <code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code> rules, which led to these enhancements, and to
him and Robert Krug for helpful discussions.
<blockquote><p>

o It is now possible to control backchaining in rules of class
<code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code> by providing a <code>:backchain-limit-lst</code> argument, as was
already allowed for rules of class <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code>.
See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.  However, unlike those other two rule classes, the value
for <code>:backchain-limit-lst</code> is prohibited from being a non-empty list; it
must be either <code>nil</code> or a non-negative integer.<p>

o (For advanced users.) It is now legal for hypothesis metafunctions to
generate, in essense, calls of <code><a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></code> and <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code>, handled
essentially as they are handled in hypotheses of <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> and
<code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> rules.  We say ``essentially'' primarily because both
<code><a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></code> and <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code> are actually macros, but hypothesis
metafunctions must generate translated terms (see <a href="TERM.html">term</a>).  The enterprising
advanced user can call <code>:</code><code><a href="TRANS.html">trans</a></code> to see examples of translated terms
corresponding to calls of <code><a href="SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></code> and <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code>.<p>

</blockquote>
A new command <code>:</code><code><a href="TRANS_bang_.html">trans!</a></code> has been added, which is like
<code>:</code><code><a href="TRANS.html">trans</a></code> except that <code>:</code><code><a href="TRANS_bang_.html">trans!</a></code> ignored issues of
single-threadedness.  See <a href="TRANS_bang_.html">trans!</a>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for suggesting this
addition.<p>

The <code>:</code><code><a href="PF.html">pf</a></code> command now works when the argument is the name of a macro
associated with a function by <a href="MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>.<p>

<strong>CHANGES IN PROOF ENGINE.</strong><p>

The simplifier has been changed slightly in order to avoid using
<a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> facts derived from a literal (essentially, a top-level
hypothesis or conclusion) that has been rewritten.  As a practical matter,
this may mean that the user should not expect forward-chaining to take place
on a term that can be rewritten for any reason (generally function expansion
or application of rewrite rules).  Formerly, the restriction was less severe:
forward-chaining facts from a hypothesis could be used as long as the
hypothesis was not rewritten to <code>t</code>.  Thanks to Art Flatau for providing an
example that led us to make this change; see the comments in source function
<code>rewrite-clause</code> for details.<p>

The rewriter has been modified to work slightly harder in relieving
hypotheses.  Thanks to Eric Smith for providing an example that inspired the
following, which illustrates the issue.  Suppose we introduce functions
<code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> with the (non-<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code>) properties shown below.

<pre>
 (encapsulate
  (((foo *) =&gt; *)
   ((bar *) =&gt; *))<p>

  (local (defun foo (x) (declare (ignore x)) t))
  (local (defun bar (x) (declare (ignore x)) t))<p>

  (defthm foo-holds
    (implies x
             (equal (foo x) t)))
  (defthm bar-holds-propositionally
    (iff (bar x) t)))
</pre>

Consider what happens when ACL2's rewriter is used to prove the following
theorem.

<pre>
(thm (foo (bar y)))
</pre>

With ACL2's inside-out rewriting, <code>(bar y)</code> is first considered, but
rewrite rule <code>bar-holds-propositionally</code> does not apply because the context
requires preserving equality, not mere Boolean (<code>iff</code>) equivalence.  Then
the rewriter moves its attention outward and sees the term <code>(foo (bar y))</code>.
It attempts to apply the rule <code>foo-holds</code>, in a context created by binding
its variable <code>x</code> to the term <code>(bar y)</code>.  It then attempts to relieve the
hypothesis <code>x</code> of rule <code>foo-holds</code> in that context.  Before this change,
ACL2 basically assumed that since rewriting was inside out, then <code>(bar y)</code>
had already been rewritten as much as possible, so the rewrite of <code>x</code> in
the aforementioned context (binding <code>x</code> to <code>(bar y)</code>) simply returned
<code>(bar y)</code>, and the attempt to relieve the hypothesis of <code>foo-holds</code>
failed.  The change is essentially for ACL2's rewriter to make a second pass
through the rewriter when the attempt fails to rewrite a variable to <code>t</code>,
this time using the fact that we are in a Boolean context.  (We mention that
source function <code>rewrite-solidify-plus</code> implements this idea, for those who
want to dig deeply into this issue.)  In our example, that means that the
rewriter considers <code>(bar y)</code> in a Boolean context, where it may apply the
rule <code>bar-holds-propositionally</code> to relieve the hypothesis successfully.<p>

When <code>(</code><code><a href="SET-NON-LINEARP.html">set-non-linearp</a></code><code> t)</code> has been executed,
<a href="NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a> can now be applied in some cases for which it
previously was not.  Thanks to Robert Krug for supplying this modification
and to Julien Schmaltz for providing a motivating example.<p>

We modified the rewriter to avoid certain infinite loops caused by an
interaction of the opening of recursive functions with equality reasoning.
(This change is documented in detail in the source code, in particular
functions <code>rewrite-fncall</code> and <code>fnstack-term-member</code>.)  Thanks to Fares
Fraij for sending us an example that led us to make this change.<p>

The <code>:</code><code><a href="EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></code> of function <code><a href="HIDE.html">hide</a></code> is now disabled
when ACL2 starts up.  This removes an anomoly, for example that

<pre>
(thm (not (equal 1 (* (hide 0) a))))
</pre>

succeeded while

<pre>
(thm (equal (foo (equal 1 (* (hide 0) a))) (foo nil)))
</pre>

failed.  Now both fail.<p>

The theory <code>*s-prop-theory*</code> is no longer used by the <i>proof-checker</i>;
it has been replaced by <code>(theory '</code><code><a href="MINIMAL-THEORY.html">minimal-theory</a></code>.  We have left
the constant <code>*s-prop-theory*</code> defined in the source code in support of
existing books, however.  This change eliminates annoying theory warnings
printed upon invocation of <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> commands <code>s-prop</code>, <code>sl</code>,
and <code>split</code>.<p>

Terms are now kept in an internal form that avoids calls of primitive
functions (built-ins without explicit definitions; see code for <code>cons-term</code>
for details), in favor of the constants that result from evlaluating those
calls.  So for example, the internal form for <code>(cons 1 2)</code> is
<code>(quote (1 . 2))</code>.  This change was made at around the same time as changes
in support of <code><a href="BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></code>; see above.  One consequence is that the
splitting of goals into cases (technically, source function <code>clausify</code> and
even more technically, source function <code>call-stack</code>) has been modified,
which can cause subgoal numbers to change.<p>

<strong>GUARD-RELATED CHANGES.</strong><p>

Guard-checking can now be caused to happen on recursive calls, where this was
formerly not the case for <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode functions and, perhaps more
important, for <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode functions whose <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not
been verified.  Moreover, a warning is printed when ACL2 does not rule out
the exclusion of guard-checking on recursive calls.  See <a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>.
Thanks to David Rager for bringing this issue to our attention, and to Rob
Sumners and the Univ. of Texas ACL2 seminar in general for their feedback.<p>

Guard violations are reported with less of the offending term hidden.  Thanks
to Jared Davis for suggesting that we look at this issue.<p>

<strong>PROOF-CHECKER CHANGES.</strong><p>

We fixed the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> so that diving works as you might expect for
a macro call <code>(op a b c)</code> representing <code>(binary-op a (binary-op b c))</code>.
In the past, if the current term was of the form <code>(append t1 t2 t3)</code>, then
<code>(DV 3)</code> (and <code>3</code>) would dive to <code>t3</code> even though the corresponding
function call is <code>(binary-append t1 (binary-append t2 t3))</code>.  This is still
the case, but now this behavior holds for any macro associated with a
function in <code><a href="BINOP-TABLE.html">binop-table</a></code> (see <a href="ADD-BINOP.html">add-binop</a>).  Moreover, users can now
write customized diving functions; see <a href="DIVE-INTO-MACROS-TABLE.html">dive-into-macros-table</a>, and also see
<code>books/misc/rtl-untranslate.lisp</code> for example calls to
<code><a href="ADD-DIVE-INTO-MACRO.html">add-dive-into-macro</a></code>.  Of course, the old behavior can still be obtained
using the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>'s <code>DIVE</code> command; see <a href="PROOF-CHECKER-COMMANDS.html">proof-checker-commands</a>.<p>

The <code>runes</code> command in the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> now shows only the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s
used by the most recent primitive or macro command (as shown by <code>:comm</code>),
unless it is given a non-<code>nil</code> argument.  Also, <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command
<code>lemmas-used</code> has been added as, in essence, an alias for <code>runes</code>.<p>

(The following two items are also mentioned above under ``BUG FIXES.'')<p>

Fixed a <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> bug that was preventing the use of the <code>DV</code>
command (or a numerical command) on <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code> expressions.  Thanks to Bill
Young for pointing out this problem.<p>

The theory <code>*s-prop-theory*</code> is no longer used by the <i>proof-checker</i>;
it has been replaced by <code>(theory '</code><code><a href="MINIMAL-THEORY.html">minimal-theory</a></code>.  We have left
the constant <code>*s-prop-theory*</code> defined in the source code in support of
existing books, however.  This change eliminates annoying theory warnings
printed upon invocation of <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> commands <code>s-prop</code>, <code>sl</code>,
and <code>split</code>.<p>

<strong>SYSTEM-LEVEL CHANGES.</strong><p>

Fixed a problem with building ACL2 on CMUCL in some systems (source function
<code>save-acl2-in-cmulisp</code>).  Thanks to Bill Pase for bringing this to our
attention.<p>

The installation instructions have been extended to include instructions for
building on GCL in Mac OS X.  Thanks to Jun Sawada and Camm Maguire.<p>

Initial pre-allocation of space has been updated for GCL to reflect more
current GCL executables (we considered GCL 2.6.1-38).  This can help avoid
running out of memory for large ACL2 sessions.<p>

The main <code>Makefile</code> has been replaced by <code>GNUmakefile</code>, in order to
enforce the use of GNU <code>make</code>.  If you use another <code>make</code> program, you'll
get an error message that may help you proceed.<p>

(GCL only) SGC is no longer turned on for GCL 2.6 sub-versions through 2.6.3
if <code>si::*optimize-maximum-pages*</code> is bound to <code>T</code>, due to an apparent
issue with their interaction in those sub-versions.  Also, we have eliminated
preallocation for all versions after 2.6.1 because GCL doesn't need it
(comments are in source function <code>save-acl2-in-akcl</code>).  Thanks to Camm
Maguire for excellent GCL help and guidance, and to Camm and Bob Boyer for
useful discussions.<p>

We have removed support for so-called ``small'' images.  Thus,
<code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="PC.html">pc</a></code>, <code><a href="VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></code>,
and other commands are fully supported in ACL2 saved images.  Because of this
and other changes in the generation of the so-called ``*1*'' logical
functions, related to guards (as described above in -GUARD-RELATED CHANGES'',
and related to the discussion of safe-mode in ``BUG FIXES'' above), image
sizes have increased substantially.<p>

We no longer <code>time</code> or run ``<code>nice</code>'' the certification of individual
books.  The file <code>books/Makefile-generic</code> had done these by default, and
some individual distributed and workshop book directories had <code>Makefile</code>s
that did so as well.  Thanks to Mike Thomas, who pointed out the lack of
<code>nice</code> on some Windows systems (and we decided on this simple solution).
Overall targets in <code>books/Makefile</code> still <code>time</code> their runs by default,
and the partiular <code>time</code> program is now controlled by a <code>Makefile</code>
variable.<p>

Failures during <code>make certify-books</code> or <code>make regression</code> now show up
in the log as ``<code>**CERTIFICATION FAILED**</code>'', regardless of the operating
system (as long as it supports <code>make</code>).  Formerly, one searched for
``<code>**</code>'' but this did not appear in openMCL runs.<p>

We have eliminated ``Undefined function'' warnings that could occur in
OpenMCL.<p>

<strong>BOOK CHANGES.</strong><p>

Reconciled the definitions of <code>firstn</code> in <code>book/misc/csort.lisp</code>,
<code>books/bdd/bdd-primitives.lisp</code>,
<code>books/ordinals/ordinal-definitions.lisp</code>, and
<code>books/data-structures/list-defuns.lisp</code>.  Thanks to Ray Richards for
bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

Distributed book <code>books/misc/defpun</code> now can handle <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s where it
did not previously.  Thanks to John Matthews for bringing this issue to our
attention.<p>

The "make" variable <code>COMPILE_FLG</code> in file <code>books/Makefile-generic</code>
formerly only had an effect if there was a <code>cert.acl2</code> file present.  That
oversight has been remedied.<p>

File <code>"books/arithmetic/certify.lsp"</code> was missing a <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>
command for <code>"natp-posp"</code>.  Thanks to John Cowles for noticing this
deficiency and supplying a fix.  (This file is of use to those who want to
certify the <code>"books/arithmetic/"</code> books without using <code>"make"</code>.)<p>

A few small changes have been made to <code>"books/rtl/rel4"</code>.<p>

Small changes were made to books <code>misc/symbol-btree</code> and
<code>misc/rtl-untranslate</code>.  In particular, the definition of <code>symbol-btreep</code>
was strengthened.<p>

We made a minor fix to <code>books/ordinals/e0-ordinal.lisp</code>, adding
<code>(verify-guards ob+)</code> and hence <code>(verify-guards ocmp)</code> as well.  This was
necessitated by the fix prohibiting functions with guards verified from
calling functions with guards not verified (see also the related discussion
under ``BUG FIXES'' above).<p>

<strong>MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.</strong><p>

Further sped up processing of large <code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> nests (extending
what was done for Version_2.7), perhaps by a factor of two in some cases.<p>

As promised in Version_2.5 (see <a href="NOTE-2-5.html">note-2-5</a>), structured pathnames are no
longer supported.  So for example, the argument to <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> must
now be a string constant.<p>

Some documentation has been improved, for <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s thanks to suggestions
by John Matthews and much of the rest thanks to feedback from Eric Smith.<p>

The function <code><a href="CURRENT-PACKAGE.html">current-package</a></code> is now available to users (it has been
taken off the list of so-called ``untouchables'').  Thanks to Jared Davis for
bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

The documentation for topic <a href="USING-COMPUTED-HINTS-7.html">using-computed-hints-7</a> has been improved.
Thanks to Doug Harper and Eric Smith for inspiring this improvement.<p>

We added several symbols to <code>*acl2-exports*</code>: <code><a href="CW.html">cw</a></code>, <code><a href="ER.html">er</a></code>,
<code><a href="INTERN$.html">intern$</a></code>, <code><a href="SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a></code>, and <code><a href="SET-DIFFERENCE-EQ.html">set-difference-eq</a></code>.
Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting most of these.<p>

Now, a <code><a href="TABLE.html">table</a></code> event that sets the value for a key,
<code>(table tbl key val :put)</code>, is redundant (see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>) when it
does not change the value associated with an existing key of the table.  In
particular, <code><a href="DEFINE-PC-MACRO.html">define-pc-macro</a></code> is now fully redundant when it does not
change an existing <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> macro-command definition.  Thanks to
Bill Young for bringing the latter issue to our attention.<p>

The definitions of unused system functions <code>ev-w</code> and <code>ev-w-lst</code> have
been deleted.<p>

ACL2 now prints a warning if a <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> event introduces a package name
with lower-case letters, since there is opportunity for later confusion in
that case.  Thanks to Frederic Peschanski for bringing this problem to our
attention and Sandip Ray for encouragement.<p>

ACL2 now works in Version 19 of CMU Common Lisp.<p>

The function <code><a href="SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></code> has been modified so that for ACL2 built on
Allegro Common Lisp in Unix or Linux, the existing environment is used.
Thanks to Erik Reeber for bringing this issue to our attention.<p>

The function <code><a href="DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a></code> can now be given a macro name that has a
corresponding function; see <a href="MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>.  Also, <code><a href="DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a></code> now
has a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> of <code>t</code> but causes a hard error on an inappropriate
argument.<p>
