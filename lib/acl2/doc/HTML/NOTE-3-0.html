<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>

Please see <a href="NOTE-2-9-5.html">note-2-9-5</a> for a description of changes since Version  2.9.4.
These include the new <code><a href="MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></code> feature, a soundness bug fix, an
improvement for <code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>, evaluation in the logic by way of
<code>:</code><code><a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></code><code> :none</code>, and many other improvements.<p>

More generally, there have been several incremental releases since
Version  2.9: see <a href="NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a>, see <a href="NOTE-2-9-2.html">note-2-9-2</a>, see <a href="NOTE-2-9-3.html">note-2-9-3</a>,
see <a href="NOTE-2-9-4.html">note-2-9-4</a>, and see <a href="NOTE-2-9-5.html">note-2-9-5</a>.<p>

A very few users have contributed books following the instructions on the
web.  We expect that when more contributions come in, we will give more
attention to the question of how to organize the distributed and workshop
books.  For now, we have simply added the new contributions according to the
old-style distribution methodology.<p>
