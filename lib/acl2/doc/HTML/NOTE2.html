Hacker mode has been eliminated and <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> mode has been added.
<a href="PROGRAMMING.html">Programming</a> mode is unsound but does syntax checking and permits
redefinitions of names.  See <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> <code>load-mode</code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> <code>g-mode</code>.<p>

The arguments to <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> have changed.  <code><a href="LD.html">Ld</a></code> is now much more
sophisticated.  See <a href="LD.html">ld</a>.<p>

For those occasions on which you wish to look at a large list
structure that you are afraid to print, try <code>(walkabout x state)</code>,
where <code>x</code> is an Acl2 expression that evaluates to the structure in
question.  I am afraid there is no <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> yet, but it is
similar in spirit to the Interlisp structure editor.  You are
standing on an object and commands move you around in it.  E.g., 1
moves you to its first element, 2 to its second, etc.; 0 moves you
up to its parent; <code>nx</code> and <code>bk</code> move you to its next sibling and
previous sibling; <code>pp</code> prettyprints it; <code><a href="Q.html">q</a></code> exits returning <code>nil</code>; <code><a href="=.html">=</a></code> exits
returning the thing you're standing on; <code>(= symb)</code> assigns the thing
you're standing on to the <a href="STATE.html">state</a> global variable <code>symb</code>.<p>

Several new <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> have been implemented, including <code>:by</code> and <code>:do-not</code>.
The old <code>:do-not-generalize</code> has been scrapped in favor of such new
<a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> as <code>:do-not</code> <code>(generalize elim)</code>.  <code>:By</code> lets you say ``this goal is
subsumed by'' a given lemma instance.  The <code>:by</code> hint also lets you
say ``this goal can't be proved yet but skip it and see how the rest
of the proof goes.'' See <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.
