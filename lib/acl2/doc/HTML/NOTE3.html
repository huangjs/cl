<a href="PROGRAMMING.html">Programming</a> mode has been eliminated.  Instead, all functions have a
``color'' which indicates what can be done with the function.  For
example, <code>:red</code> functions can be executed but have no axioms
describing them.  Thus, <code>:red</code> functions can be introduced after
passing a simple syntactic check and they can be redefined without
undoing.  But nothing of consequence can be proved about them.  At
the other extreme are <code>:gold</code> functions which can be executed and
which also have passed both the termination and the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>
verification proofs.  The color of a function can be specified with
the new <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code> keyword, <code>:color</code>, which, if omitted defaults to the
global setting of <code>ld-color</code>.  <code>Ld-color</code> replaces <code>load-mode</code>.  Setting
<code>ld-color</code> to <code>:red</code> causes behavior similar to the old <code>:g-mode</code>.
Setting <code>ld-color</code> to <code>:gold</code> causes behavior similar to the old
<code>:v-mode</code>.  It is possible to prototype your system in <code>:red</code> and then
convert <code>:red</code> functions to :<code>blue</code> individually by calling
<code><a href="VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></code> on them.  They can then be converted to <code>:gold</code>
with <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code>.  This allows us to undertake to verify the
termination and <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of system functions.  See <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> color for an
introduction to the use of colors.<p>

Type prescription rules have been added.  Recall that in Nqthm, some
<code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rules were actually stored as ``<a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>s.''  Such
rules allow the user to inform Nqthm's primitive type mechanism as
to the kinds of shells returned by a function.  Earlier versions of
Acl2 did not have an analogous kind of rule because Acl2's type
mechanism is complicated by <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s.  Version 1.3 supports
<code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rules.  See <a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>.<p>

Three more new <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> implement congruence-based rewriting.
It is possible to identify a binary relation as an equivalence
relation (see <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a>), to show that one equivalence
relation refines another (see <a href="REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a>) and to show that a
given equivalence relation is maintained when rewriting a given
function call, e.g., <code>(fn ...xk...)</code>, by maintaining another
equivalence relation while rewriting the <code>k</code>th argument
(see <a href="CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a>).  If <code>r</code> has been shown to be an <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a>
relation and then <code>(implies hyps (r (foo x) (bar x)))</code> is proved as a
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rule, then instances of <code>(foo x)</code> will be replaced by
corresponding instances of <code>(bar x)</code> provided the instance occurs in a
slot where the maintainence of <code>r-equivalence</code> is known to be
sufficient and <code>hyps</code> can be established as usual.<p>

In Version 1.2, <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> were simple keywords, e.g., <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> or
<code>:</code><code><a href="ELIM.html">elim</a></code>.  In Version 1.3, <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> have been elaborated to allow
you to specify how the theorem ought to be used as a rule.  That is,
the new <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> allows you to separate the mathematical
statement of the formula from its interpretation as a rule.
See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.<p>

Rules used to be named by symbols, e.g., <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> and <code>car-cons</code> were the
names of rules.  Unfortunately, this was ambiguous because there are
three rules associated with function symbols: the symbolic
definition, the executable counterpart, and the <a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>;
many different rules might be associated with theorems, depending on
the rule classes.  In Version 1.3 rules are named by ``<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s''
(which is just short hand for ``rule names'').  Example <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s are
<code>(:definition car)</code>, <code>(:executable-counterpart car)</code>, and
<code>(:type-prescription car . 1)</code>.  Every rule added by an event has a
different name and you can <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a> and <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a> them independently.
See <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> and see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a>.<p>

The identity function <code><a href="FORCE.html">force</a></code>, of one argument, has been added and
given a special interpretation by the functions responsible for
establishing hypotheses in backchaining: When the system fails to
establish some hypothesis of the form <code>(force term)</code>, it simply
assumes it is true and goes on, delaying until later the
establishment of term.  In particular, pushes a new subgoal to prove
term in the current context.  When that subgoal is attacked, all of
the resources of the theorem prover, not just rewriting, are brought
to bear.  Thus, for example, if you wish to prove the rule
<code>(implies (good-statep s) (equal (exec s n) s'))</code> and it is your
expectation that every time <code>exec</code> appears its first argument is a
<code>good-statep</code> then you might write the rule as
<code>(implies (force (good-statep s)) (equal (exec s n) s'))</code>.  This
rule is essentially an unconditional rewrite of <code>(exec s n)</code> to
<code>s'</code> that spawns the new goal <code>(good-statep s)</code>.  See <a href="FORCE.html">force</a>.
Because you can now specify independently how a theorem is used as a
rule, you need not write the <code><a href="FORCE.html">force</a></code> in the actual theorem proved.
See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.<p>

Version 1.3 supports a facility similar to Nqthm's <code><a href="BREAK-LEMMA.html">break-lemma</a></code>.
See <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>.  You can install ``<a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>s'' on <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s that
will cause interactive breaks under certain conditions.<p>

Acl2 also provides ``<a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>s'' which allow you to write functions
that cause interaction with the user but which do not require that
you have access to <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  See <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>.<p>

The rewriter now automatically backchains to stronger recognizers.
There is no user hook to this feature but it may simplify some
proofs with which older versions of Acl2 had trouble.  For example,
if the rewriter is trying to prove <code>(rationalp (foo a b c))</code> it is now
smart enough to try lemmas that match with <code>(integerp (foo a b c))</code>.
