<h2>NOTE4</h2>Acl2 Version 1.4 Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

Once again <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> only takes one required argument, as the <code>bind-flg</code> has
been deleted.<p>

Three commands have been added in the spirit of <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code>.  <code>:</code><code><a href="PE_bang_.html">Pe!</a></code> is
similar to <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> but it prints all <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> with the given name, rather
than just the most recent.  The command <code>:</code><code><a href="PF.html">pf</a></code> prints the corollary
formula corresponding to a name or <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.  The command <code>:</code><code><a href="PL.html">pl</a></code> (print
lemmas) prints rules whose top function symbol is the given name.
See <a href="PE_bang_.html">pe!</a>, see <a href="PF.html">pf</a>, and see <a href="PL.html">pl</a>.<p>

Book naming conventions have been changed somewhat.  The
once-required <code>.lisp</code> extension is now prohibited!  Directories are
supported, including a notion of ``connected book directory''.
See <a href="BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>.  Also, the second argument of <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is
now optional, defaulting to <code>0</code>.<p>

<a href="COMPILATION.html">Compilation</a> is now supported inside the Acl2 loop.  See <a href="COMP.html">comp</a>
and see <a href="SET-COMPILE-FNS.html">set-compile-fns</a>.<p>

The default color is now part of the Acl2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>;
see <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> <code>default-color</code>.  <code>Ld-color</code> is no longer an <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> special.
Instead, colors are <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>; see the documentation for <code>red</code>,
<code>pink</code>, <code>blue</code>, and <code>gold</code>.<p>

A <a href="TABLE.html">table</a> exists for controlling whether Acl2 prints comments when it
<a href="FORCE.html">force</a>s hypotheses of rules; see <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> <code>force-table</code>.  Also, it is now
possible to turn off the forcing of assumptions by disabling the
definition of <a href="FORCE.html">force</a>; see <a href="FORCE.html">force</a>.<p>

The event <code>defconstant</code> is no longer supported, but a very similar
event, <code><a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></code>, has been provided in its place.  See <a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a>.<p>

The event for defining <a href="CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> relations is now <code><a href="DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></code>
(formerly, <code>defcon</code>).<p>

Patterns are now allowed in <code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.  See the documentation
for <code>:expand</code> inside the documentation for <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

We have improved the way we report rules used by the simplifier.
All <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s of the same type are reported together in the running
commentary associated with each goal, so that for example,
executable counterparts are listed separately from definitions, and
rewrite rules are listed separately from <a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a> rules.  The
preprocessor now mentions ``simple'' rules; see <a href="SIMPLE.html">simple</a>.<p>

The mechanism for printing warning messages for new rewrite rules,
related to subsumption, now avoids worrying about nonrecursive
function symbols when those symbols are <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.  These messages
have also been eliminated for the case where the old rule is a
<code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code> rule.<p>

Backquote has been modified so that it can usually provide
predictable results when used on the left side of a rewrite rule.<p>

Time statistics are now printed even when an event fails.<p>

The Acl2 trace package has been modified so that it prints using the
values of the Lisp globals <code>*print-level*</code> and <code>*print-length*</code>
(respectively).<p>

<a href="TABLE.html">Table</a> has been modified so that the <code>:clear</code> option lets you replace
the entire <a href="TABLE.html">table</a> with one that satisfies the <code>val</code> and key guards (if
any); see <a href="TABLE.html">table</a>.<p>

We have relaxed the translation rules for <code>:measure</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> to <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>,
so that the the same rules apply to these terms that apply to terms
in <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  In particular, in <code>:measure</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> <code><a href="MV.html">mv</a></code> is treated
just like <code><a href="LIST.html">list</a></code>, and <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> receives no special handling.<p>

The <a href="LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a> test has been relaxed.  The old test required that
every new argument be strictly less than the corresponding old
argument in a certain <a href="TERM-ORDER.html">term-order</a>.  The new test uses a lexicographic
order on term lists instead.  For example, consider the following
rewrite rule.

<pre>
  (equal
   (variable-update var1
                    val1 (variable-update var2 val2 vs))
   (variable-update var2
                    val2 (variable-update var1 val1 vs)))
</pre>

This rule is permutative.  Now imagine that we want to apply this
rule to the term

<pre>
  (variable-update u y (variable-update u x vs)).
</pre>

Since the actual corresponding to both <code>var1</code> and <code>var2</code> is <code>u</code>, which
is not strictly less than itself in the <a href="TERM-ORDER.html">term-order</a>, this rule would
fail to be applied in this situation when using the old test.
However, since the pair <code>(u x)</code> is lexicographically less than the
pair <code>(u y)</code> with respect to our <a href="TERM-ORDER.html">term-order</a>, the rule is in fact
applied using our new test.<p>

Messages about <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> now contain a space after certain left
parentheses, in order to assist emacs users.  For example, the event

<pre>
  (defthm abc (equal (+ (len x) 0) (len x)))
</pre>

leads to a summary containing the line

<pre>
  Form:  ( DEFTHM ABC ...)
</pre>

and hence, if you search backwards for ``<code>(defthm abc</code>'', you won't
stop at this message.<p>

More tautology checking is done during a proof; in fact, no goal
printed to the screen, except for the results of applying <code>:use</code> and
<code>:by</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> or the top-level goals from an induction proof, are known
to Acl2 to be tautologies.<p>

The <code><a href="LD-QUERY-CONTROL-ALIST.html">ld-query-control-alist</a></code> may now be used to suppress printing of
queries; see <a href="LD-QUERY-CONTROL-ALIST.html">ld-query-control-alist</a>.<p>

Warning messages are printed with short summary strings, for example
the string ``<code>Use</code>'' in the following message.

<pre>
  Acl2 Warning [Use] in DEFTHM:  It is unusual to :USE an enabled
  :REWRITE or :DEFINITION rule, so you may want to consider
  disabling FOO.
</pre>

At the end of the event, just before the time is printed, all such
summary strings are printed out.<p>

The keyword command <code>:u</code> has been introduced as an abbreviation for
<code>:</code><code><a href="UBT.html">ubt</a></code> <code>:</code><code><a href="MAX.html">max</a></code>.  Printing of query messages is suppressed by <code>:u</code>.<p>

The keyword <code>:cheat</code> is no longer supported by any event form.<p>

Some irrelevant formals are detected; see <a href="IRRELEVANT-FORMALS.html">irrelevant-formals</a>.<p>

A bug in the application of metafunctions was fixed: now if the
output of a metafunction is equal to its input, the application of
the metafunction is deemed unsuccessful and the next metafunction is
tried.<p>

An example has been added to the documentation for <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a>
to suggest how to make use of <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relations in rewriting.<p>

The following Common Lisp functions have been added to Acl2:
<code><a href="ALPHA-CHAR-P.html">alpha-char-p</a></code>, <code><a href="UPPER-CASE-P.html">upper-case-p</a></code>, <code><a href="LOWER-CASE-P.html">lower-case-p</a></code>, <code><a href="CHAR-UPCASE.html">char-upcase</a></code>,
<code><a href="CHAR-DOWNCASE.html">char-downcase</a></code>, <code><a href="STRING-DOWNCASE.html">string-downcase</a></code>, <code><a href="STRING-UPCASE.html">string-upcase</a></code>, and <code>digit-charp-p</code>.<p>

A documentation section called <code><a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a></code> has been added for the
interactive facility, whose documentation has been slightly
improved.  See in particular the documentation for
<a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>, <code><a href="VERIFY.html">verify</a></code>, and <a href="MACRO-COMMAND.html">macro-command</a>.<p>

A number of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that had been inadvertently disallowed in <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>
are now permitted in <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  These are:  <code><a href="DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></code>, <code>defcor</code>, <code><a href="DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a></code>,
<code><a href="DEFREFINEMENT.html">defrefinement</a></code>, <code><a href="DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a></code>, and <code><a href="VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></code>.<p>
