<h2>NOTE8</h2>ACL2 Version 1.8 (May, 1995) Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="NOTE8-UPDATE.html">note8-update</a> for yet more recent changes.<p>

<a href="GUARD.html">Guard</a>s have been eliminated from the ACL2 logic.  A summary is
contained in this brief note.  Also see <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and
see <a href="SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>.<p>

<a href="GUARD.html">Guard</a>s may be included in <a href="DEFUNS.html">defuns</a> as usual but are ignored from the
perspective of admission to the logic: functions must terminate on
all arguments.<p>

As in Nqthm, primitive functions, e.g., <code><a href="+.html">+</a></code> and <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code>, logically
default unexpected arguments to convenient values.  Thus, <code>(+ 'abc 3)</code>
is <code>3</code> and <code>(car 'abc)</code> is <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a>, and see
the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for the individual primitive functions.<p>

In contrast to earlier versions of ACL2, Version 1.8 logical
functions are executed at Nqthm speeds even when <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not
been verified.  In versions before 1.8, such functions were
interpreted by ACL2.<p>

Colors have been eliminated.  Two ``<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>s'' are supported,
<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>.  Roughly speaking, <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> does what <code>:red</code> used
to do, namely, allow you to prototype functions for execution
without any proof burdens.  <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">Logic</a></code> mode does what <code>:blue</code> used to do,
namely, allow you to add a new definitional axiom to the logic.  A
global <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a> is comparable to the old default color.
The system comes up in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode.  To change the global
<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>, type <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> at the top-level.  To specify
the <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> of a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> locally use

<pre>
<code>(declare (xargs :mode mode))</code>.
</pre>
<p>

The <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a> has changed.  The initial <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>, indicating <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode,
is

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>

If you change to <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode the <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a> becomes

<pre>
ACL2 p!&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<a href="GUARD.html">Guard</a>s can be seen as having either of two roles: (a) they are a
specification device allowing you to characterize the kinds of
inputs a function ``should'' have, or (b) they are an efficiency
device allowing logically defined functions to be executed directly
in Common Lisp.  If a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is specified, as with <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code> <code>:</code><code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a></code>, then
it is ``verified'' at defun-time (unless you also specify <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code>
<code>:verify-guards nil</code>).  <a href="GUARD.html">Guard</a> verification means what it always has:
the input <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> is shown to imply the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s on all subroutines in
the body.  If the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of a function are verified, then a call of
the function on inputs satisfying the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> can be computed directly
by Common Lisp.  Thus, verifying the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s on your functions will
allow them to execute more efficiently.  But it does not affect
their logical behavior and since you will automatically get Nqthm
speeds on unverified logical definitions, most users will probably
use <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s either as a specification device or only use them when
execution efficiency is extremely important.<p>

Given the presence of <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s in the system, two issues are unavoidable.
Are <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s verified as part of the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> process?  And are <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s checked
when terms are evaluated?  We answer both of those questions below.<p>

Roughly speaking, in its initial <a href="STATE.html">state</a> the system will try to verify
the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> if a <code>:</code><code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a></code> is supplied in the <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code>
and will not try otherwise.  However, <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> verification in <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>
can be inhibited ``locally'' by supplying the <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code>
<code>:</code><code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code> <code>nil</code>.  ``Global'' inhibition can be obtained via
the <code>:</code><code><a href="SET-VERIFY-GUARDS-EAGERNESS.html">set-verify-guards-eagerness</a></code>.  If you do not use the
<code>:</code><code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a></code> <code><a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a></code>, you will not need to think about <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>
verification.<p>

We now turn to the evaluation of expressions.  Even if your functions contain
no <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s, the primitive functions do and hence you have the choice: when you
submit an expression for evaluation do you mean for <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s to be checked at
runtime or not?  Put another way, do you mean for the expression to be
evaluated in Common Lisp (if possible) or in the logic?  Note: If Common Lisp
delivers an answer, it will be the same as in the logic, but it might be
erroneous to execute the form in Common Lisp.  For example, should
<code>(car 'abc)</code> cause a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> violation error or return <code>nil</code>?<p>

The top-level ACL2 loop has a variable which controls which sense of
execution is provided.  To turn ``<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> checking on,'' by which we
mean that <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s are checked at runtime, execute the top-level form
<code>:set-guard-checking t</code>.  To turn it off, do <code>:set-guard-checking nil</code>.
The status of this variable is reflected in the <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>.

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>

means <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> checking is on and

<pre>
ACL2 &gt;
</pre>

means <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> checking is off.  The exclamation mark can be thought of
as ``barring'' certain computations.  The absence of the mark
suggests the absence of error messages or unbarred access to the
logical axioms.  Thus, for example

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(car 'abc)
</pre>

will signal an error, while

<pre>
ACL2 &gt;(car 'abc)
</pre>

will return <code>nil</code>.<p>

Note that whether or not <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s are checked at runtime is
independent of whether you are operating in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode or
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode and whether theorems are being proved or not.
(Although it must be added that functions defined in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>
mode cannot help but check their <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s because no logical
definition exists.)<p>

Version 1.8 permits the verification of the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of theorems, thus
insuring that all instances of the theorem will evaluate without
error in Common Lisp.  To verify the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of a theorem named
<code>name</code> execute the event

<pre>
(verify-guards name).
</pre>

If a theorem's <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s have been verified, the theorem is guaranteed
to evaluate without error to non-<code>nil</code> in Common Lisp (provided
resource errors do not arise).<p>

Caveat about <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code>: <code><a href="IMPLIES.html">implies</a></code> is a function symbol, so in the
term <code>(implies p q)</code>, <code>p</code> cannot be assumed true when <code>q</code> is evaluated;
they are both evaluated ``outside.''  Hence, you cannot generally
verify the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s on a theorem if <code><a href="IMPLIES.html">implies</a></code> is used to state the
hypotheses.  Use <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code> instead.  In a future version of ACL2, <code><a href="IMPLIES.html">implies</a></code>
will likely be a macro.<p>

See sum-list-example.lisp for a nice example of the use of Version
1.8.  This is roughly the same as the documentation for
<a href="GUARD-EXAMPLE.html">guard-example</a>.<p>

We have removed the capability to do ``old-style-forcing'' as
existed before Version 1.5.  See <a href="NOTE5.html">note5</a>.<p>

NOTE:  Some low level details have, of course, changed.  One such
change is that there are no longer two distinct type prescriptions
stored when a function is admitted with its <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s verified.  So for
example, the type prescription <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> for <code><a href="BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></code> is now

<pre>
(:type-prescription binary-append)
</pre>

while in Versions 1.7 and earlier, there were two such <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s:

<pre>
(:type-prescription binary-append . 1)
(:type-prescription binary-append . 2)
</pre>
<p>

Nqthm-style forcing on <a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a> arithmetic assumptions is no longer
executed when forcing is <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.<p>

Functional instantiation now benefits from a trick also used in
Nqthm:  once a <a href="CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a> generated by a <code>:functional-instance</code>
lemma instance (see <a href="LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>) has been proved on behalf
of a successful event, it will not have to be re-proved on behalf of
a later event.<p>

<code><a href="1+.html">1+</a></code> and <code><a href="1-.html">1-</a></code> are now macros in the logic, not functions.  Hence, for
example, it is ``safe'' to use them on left-hand sides of rewrite
rules, without invoking the common warning about the presence of
nonrecursive function symbols.<p>

A new <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> section <a href="FILE-READING-EXAMPLE.html">file-reading-example</a> illustrates how to
process forms in a file.<p>

A new <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command <code>forwardchain</code> has been added;
see <a href="ACL2-PC_colon__colon_FORWARDCHAIN.html">acl2-pc::forwardchain</a>.<p>

It is now possible to use quantifiers.  See <a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> and
see <a href="DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.<p>

There is a new event <code><a href="SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a></code>, which allows the user
to turn off warnings of various types.
see <a href="SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a>.<p>

An unsoundness relating <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> and <code>:functional-instance</code>
<a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> has been remedied, with a few small effects visible at the
user level.  The main observable effect is that <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> and
non-local <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> are no longer allowed in the scope
of any <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event that has a non-empty <a href="SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>.<p>

When <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is called, we now require that the default
<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> (see <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>) be <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>.  On a related
note, the default <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> is irrelevant to <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>; the
mode is always set to <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> initially, though it may be changed
within the book and reverts to its original value at the conclusion
of the <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>.  A bug in <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> prevented it from
acting this way even though the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> said otherwise.<p>

The <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been substantially improved.  A new
section ``Programming'' contains <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of many useful
functions provided by ACL2; see <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a>.  Also, the
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been ``marked up'' extensively.  Thus in
particular, users of Mosaic will find many links in the
<a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.<p>

The symbols <code><a href="FORCE.html">force</a></code>, <code><a href="MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></code>, and <code>acl2-count</code> have been added
to the list <code>*acl2-exports*</code>.<p>

We now permit most names from the main Lisp package to be used as
names, except for names that define functions, macros, or constants.
See <a href="NAME.html">name</a>.<p>

We have changed the list of imports from the Common Lisp package to
ACL2, i.e., the list <code>*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</code>,
to be exactly those external symbols of the Common Lisp package as
specified by the draft Common Lisp standard.  In order to
accommodate this change, we have renamed some ACL2 functions as
shown below, but these and other ramifications of this change should
be transparent to most ACL2 users.

<pre>
warning      --&gt; warning$
print-object --&gt; print-object$
</pre>
<p>

Proof trees are no longer enabled by default.  To start them up,
<code>:</code><code><a href="START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a></code>.<p>

We have added the capability of building smaller images.  The
easiest way to do this on a Unix (trademark of AT&amp;T) system is:
<code>make small</code>.<p>


<p>
Here we will put some less important changes, additions, and so on.<p>

We have added definitions for the Common Lisp function <code><a href="POSITION.html">position</a></code>
(for the test <code><a href="EQL.html">eql</a></code>), as well as corresponding versions
<code><a href="POSITION-EQUAL.html">position-equal</a></code> and <code><a href="POSITION-EQ.html">position-eq</a></code> that use tests <code><a href="EQUAL.html">equal</a></code> and
<code><a href="EQ.html">eq</a></code>, respectively.  See <a href="POSITION.html">position</a>, see <a href="POSITION-EQUAL.html">position-equal</a>,
and see <a href="POSITION-EQ.html">position-eq</a>.<p>

The <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event <code>rational-listp-implies-rationalp-car</code> no
longer exists.<p>

We fixed a bug in the hint mechanism that applied <code>:by</code>, <code>:cases</code>, and
<code>:use</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> to the first induction goal when the prover reverted to
proving the original goal by induction.<p>

We fixed a bug in the handling of <code>(set-irrelevant-formals-ok :warn)</code>.<p>

In support of removing the old-style forcing capability, we deleted
the initialization of <a href="STATE.html">state</a> global <code>old-style-forcing</code> and deleted the
definitions of <code>recover-assumptions</code>, <code>recover-assumptions-from-goal</code>,
<code>remove-assumptions1</code>, <code>remove-assumptions</code>, and <code>split-on-assumptions</code>,
and we renamed <code>split-on-assumptions1</code> to <code>split-on-assumptions</code>.<p>

The special value <code>'none</code> in the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> commands <code>claim</code> and <code><a href="=.html">=</a></code>
has been replaced by <code>:none</code>.<p>

A bug in the handling of <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> by subgoals has been fixed.  For
example, formerly a <code>:do-not</code> hint could be ``erased'' by a <code>:use</code> hint
on a subgoal.  Thanks go to Art Flatau for noticing the bug.<p>

The functions <code>weak-termp</code> and <code>weak-term-listp</code> have been
deleted, and their calls have been replaced by corresponding calls
of <code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> and <code>pseudo-term-listp</code>.  The notion of
<code><a href="PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></code> has been slightly strenthened by requiring that
terms of the form <code>(quote ...)</code> have length 2.<p>

Performance has been improved in various ways.  At the prover level,
backchaining through the recognizer alist has been eliminated in
order to significantly speed up ACL2's rewriter.  Among the other
prover changes (of which there are several, all technical):  we no
longer clausify the input term when a proof is interrupted in favor
of inducting on the input term.  At the <a href="IO.html">IO</a> level, we have improved
performance somewhat by suitable declarations and proclamations.
These include technical modifications to the macros <code><a href="MV.html">mv</a></code> and
<code><a href="MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></code>, and introduction of a macro <code>the-mv</code> analogous to the
macro <code><a href="THE.html">the</a></code> but for forms returning multiple values.<p>

The function <code>spaces</code> now takes an extra argument, the current column.<p>

A bug in the <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> <code>equiv</code> command was fixed.<p>

The function <code>intersectp</code> has been deleted, because it was
essentially duplicated by the function <code><a href="INTERSECTP-EQUAL.html">intersectp-equal</a></code>.<p>

We now proclaim functions in AKCL and GCL before compiling <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.
This should result in somewhat increased speed.<p>

The function <code>repeat</code> has been eliminated; use <code><a href="MAKE-LIST.html">make-list</a></code>
instead.<p>

The <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a> command <code>expand</code> has been fixed so that it
eliminates <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code> (lambda) expressions when one would expect it to.<p>

A new primitive function, <code><a href="MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></code>, has been introduced.  <code><a href="MV-NTH.html">Mv-nth</a></code>
is equivalent to <code><a href="NTH.html">nth</a></code> and is used in place of <code><a href="NTH.html">nth</a></code> in the
translation of <code><a href="MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></code> expressions.  This allows the user to
control the simplification of <code><a href="MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></code> expressions without
affecting how <code><a href="NTH.html">nth</a></code> is treated.  In that spirit, the rewriter has
been modified so that certain <code><a href="MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></code> expressions, namely those
produced in the translation of <code>(mv-let (a b c)(mv x y z) p)</code>, are
given special treatment.<p>

A minor bug in <code>untranslate</code> has been fixed, which for example will
fix the printing of conjunctions.<p>

<code>Translate</code> now takes a <code>logicp</code> argument, which indicates whether it
enforces the restriction that <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode functions do not occur
in the result.<p>

The modified version of <code>trace</code> provided by ACL2, for use in raw Lisp,
has been modified so that the lisp special variable <code>*trace-alist*</code>
has a slightly different functionality.  This alist associates,
using <code><a href="EQ.html">eq</a></code>, symbols with the print representations of their values.
For example, initially <code>*trace-alist*</code> is a one-element list
containing the pair <code>(cons 'state '|*the-live-state*|)</code>.  Thus, one
may cons the pair <code>(cons '*foo* "It's a FOO!")</code> on to <code>*trace-alist*</code>;
then until <code>*foo*</code> is defined, this change will have no effect, but
after for example

<pre>
(defconst *foo* 17)
</pre>

then <code>trace</code> will print <code>17</code> as <code>"It's a FOO!"</code>.<p>

<code>Trace</code> also traces the corresponding logic function.<p>

<a href="PROOF-TREE.html">Proof-tree</a> display has been improved slightly in the case of
successful proofs and certain event failures.<p>

The function <code>positive-integer-log2</code> has been deleted.<p>

The macro <code><a href="SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></code> now prints a warning message when it is
encountered in the context of an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event or a book.
See <a href="SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>.<p>

Some functions related to <code>the-fn</code> and <code>wormhole1</code> now have
<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>, but this change is almost certain to
be inconsequential to all users.<p>
