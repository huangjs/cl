<h2>NOTE9</h2>ACL2 Version 1.9 (Fall, 1996) Notes
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.html">RELEASE-NOTES</a>

By default, when the system is started it is illegal to use the
variable <code><a href="STATE.html">STATE</a></code> as a formal parameter of a function definition.
The aim is to prevent novice users from stumbling into the Byzantine
syntactic restrictions on that variable symbol.  Use

<pre>
:set-state-ok t
</pre>

or, equivalently,

<pre>
(set-state-ok t)
</pre>

to switch back to the old default mode.  See <a href="SET-STATE-OK.html">set-state-ok</a><p>

<code>Set-state-ok</code> is an event that affects the ACL2 defaults table
(see <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>).  Recall that when books are
included, the defaults table is restored to its pre-inclusion state.
Thus, while a <code>set-state-ok</code> form will permit the book to define a
<code>state</code>-using function, it will not permit the user of the book to
make such a definition.  We recommend putting <code>(set-state-ok t)</code> in
any book that defines a <code>state</code> using function.<p>

Books certified under Version 1.8 must be recertified under Version
1.9.  See :DOC version.<p>

The simplifier has been made to look out for built-in clauses,
whereas in past versions such clauses were only noticed by the
``preprocessor'' at the top of the waterfall.  THIS CHANGE MAY
PREVENT OLD SCRIPTS FROM REPLAYING!  The undesirable side-effect is
caused by the fact that <code>:HINTS</code> require you to refer to clauses by
their exact name (see <a href="GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>) and because the new simplifier
proves more clauses than before, the goals produced have different
names.  Thus, if a script uses <code>:HINTS</code> that refer to clauses other
than "Goal", e.g., "Subgoal 1.3" then the hint may be applied to
a different subgoal than originally intended.<p>

The use of built-in-clauses has been made more efficient.  If a set
of clauses arise often in a piece of work, it might be advantageous
to build them in even if that results in a large set (hundreds?) of
built-in clauses.  See <a href="BUILT-IN-CLAUSES.html">built-in-clauses</a><p>

Wormholes can now be used in :logic mode functions. See <a href="WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a><p>

It is now possible to provide ``computed hints.''  For example, have
you ever wished to say ``in all goals with a name like this, :use
that'' or ``if this term is in the subgoal, then :use that''?  Well,
see <a href="COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a> and the extraordinarily long example in
see <a href="USING-COMPUTED-HINTS.html">using-computed-hints</a>.<p>

<code>Hide</code> terms may be rewritten with :rewrite rules about <code>hide</code>.
See <a href="HIDE.html">hide</a>, where we also now explain why <code>hide</code> terms are sometimes
introduced into your proof attempts.
<p>
A bug that sometimes caused the ``non-lazy IF'' hard error message
was fixed.<p>

A bug that sometimes caused a hard error in forward chaining was
fixed.<p>

A bug in print-rules (:pr) was fixed.<p>

We report the use of :executable-counterparts in the evaluation of
SYNTAXP forms.<p>

Some documentation errors were fixed.<p>

A bug in parent-tree tracking in add-literal-and-pt was fixed.<p>

A bug in ok$, go$ and eval$ was fixed.<p>

Clausify now optimizes (mv-nth 'k (list x0 ... xk ... xn)) to xk.<p>
