Using the nonnegative integers and lists we can represent the ordinals up to
<code>epsilon-0</code>. The ordinal representation used in ACL2 has changed as
of Version_2.8 from that of Nqthm-1992, courtesy of Pete Manoilios and Daron
Vroon; additional discussion may be found in ``Ordinal Arithmetic in ACL2'',
proceedings of ACL2 Workshop 2003,
<code>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2003/</code>.  Previously,
ACL2's notion of ordinal was very similar to the development given in ``New
Version of the Consistency Proof for Elementary Number Theory'' in The
Collected Papers of Gerhard Gentzen, ed. M.E. Szabo, North-Holland
Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969, pp 132-213.

The following essay is intended to provide intuition about ordinals.
The truth, of course, lies simply in the ACL2 definitions of
<code>o-p</code> and <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code>.<p>

Very intuitively, think of each non-zero natural number as by being
denoted by a series of the appropriate number of strokes, i.e.,

<pre>
0             0
1             |
2             ||
3             |||
4             ||||
...           ...
</pre>

Then ``<code>omega</code>,'' here written as <code>w</code>, is the ordinal that might be
written as

<pre>
w             |||||...,
</pre>

i.e., an infinite number of strokes.  Addition here is just
concatenation.  Observe that adding one to the front of <code>w</code> in the
picture above produces <code>w</code> again, which gives rise to a standard
definition of <code>w</code>:  <code>w</code> is the least ordinal such that adding another
stroke at the beginning does not change the ordinal.<p>

We denote by <code>w+w</code> or <code>w*2</code> the ``<code>doubly infinite</code>'' sequence that we
might write as follows.

<pre>
w*2           |||||... |||||... 
</pre>

One way to think of <code>w*2</code> is that it is obtained by replacing each
stroke in <code>2</code> <code>(||)</code> by <code>w</code>.  Thus, one can imagine <code>w*3</code>, <code>w*4</code>, etc., which
leads ultimately to the idea of ``<code>w*w</code>,'' the ordinal obtained by
replacing each stroke in <code>w</code> by <code>w</code>.  This is also written as ``<code>omega</code>
squared'' or <code>w^2</code>, or:

<pre>
 2
w             |||||... |||||... |||||... |||||... |||||... ...
</pre>

We can analogously construct <code>w^3</code> by replacing each stroke in <code>w</code> by
<code>w^2</code> (which, it turns out, is the same as replacing each stroke in
<code>w^2</code> by <code>w</code>).  That is, we can construct <code>w^3</code> as <code>w</code> copies of <code>w^2</code>,

<pre>
 3              2       2       2       2
w              w  ...  w  ...  w  ...  w ... ...
</pre>

Then we can construct <code>w^4</code> as <code>w</code> copies of <code>w^3</code>, <code>w^5</code> as <code>w</code> copies of
<code>w^4</code>, etc., ultimately suggesting <code>w^w</code>.  We can then stack <code>omega</code>s,
i.e., <code>(w^w)^w</code> etc.  Consider the ``limit'' of all of those stacks,
which we might display as follows.

<pre>
       .         
      .
     .
    w
   w
  w
 w
w
</pre>

That is epsilon-0.<p>

Below we begin listing some ordinals up to <code>epsilon-0</code>; the reader can
fill in the gaps at his or her leisure.  We show in the left column
the conventional notation, using <code>w</code> as ``<code>omega</code>,'' and in the right
column the ACL2 object representing the corresponding ordinal.

Observe that the sequence of <code>o-p</code>s starts with the natural
numbers (which are recognized by <code><a href="NATP.html">natp</a></code>). This is convenient
because it means that if a term, such as a measure expression for
justifying a recursive function (see <a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a>) must produce an <code>o-p</code>,
it suffices for it to produce a natural number.<p>

The ordinals listed above are listed in ascending order.  This is
the ordering tested by <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code>.<p>

The ``<code>epsilon-0</code> ordinals'' of ACL2 are recognized by the recursively
defined function <code>o-p</code>.  The base case of the recursion tells us that
natural numbers are <code>epsilon-0</code> ordinals.  Otherwise, an <code>epsilon-0</code>
ordinal is a list of <code><a href="CONS.html">cons</a></code> pairs whose final <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code> is a natural
number, <code>((a1 . x1) (a2 . x2) ... (an . xn) . p)</code>.  This corresponds to
the ordinal <code>(w^a1)x1 + (w^a2)x2 + ... + (w^an)xn + p</code>.  Each <code>ai</code> is an
ordinal in the ACL2 representation that is not equal to 0.  The sequence of
the <code>ai</code>'s is strictly decreasing (as defined by <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code>). Each <code>xi</code>
is a positive integer (as recognized by <code><a href="POSP.html">posp</a></code>).<p>

Note that infinite ordinals should generally be created using the ordinal
constructor, <code><a href="MAKE-ORD.html">make-ord</a></code>, rather than <code><a href="CONS.html">cons</a></code>. The functions
<code><a href="O-FIRST-EXPT.html">o-first-expt</a></code>, <code><a href="O-FIRST-COEFF.html">o-first-coeff</a></code>, and <code><a href="O-RST.html">o-rst</a></code> are ordinals
destructors.  Finally, the function <code><a href="O-FINP.html">o-finp</a></code> and the macro <code><a href="O-INFP.html">o-infp</a></code>
tell whether an ordinal is finite or infinite, respectively.<p>

The function <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> compares two <code>epsilon-0</code> ordinals, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
If both are integers, <code>(o&lt; x y)</code> is just <code>x&lt;y</code>.  If one is an integer
and the other is a <code><a href="CONS.html">cons</a></code>, the integer is the smaller.  Otherwise,
<code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> recursively compares the <code><a href="O-FIRST-EXPT.html">o-first-expt</a></code>s of the ordinals to
determine which is smaller.  If they are the same, the <code><a href="O-FIRST-COEFF.html">o-first-coeff</a></code>s
of the ordinals are compared.  If they are equal, the <code><a href="O-RST.html">o-rst</a></code>s of the
ordinals are recursively compared.<p>

Fundamental to ACL2 is the fact that <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> is well-founded on
<code>epsilon-0</code> ordinals.  That is, there is no ``infinitely descending
chain'' of such ordinals.  See <a href="PROOF-OF-WELL-FOUNDEDNESS.html">proof-of-well-foundedness</a>.
