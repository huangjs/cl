<h2>ORDINALS</h2>ordinals in ACL2
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

Ordinals are used in ACL2 for proving termination in the admission of
recursive function definitions.  For a proof that the ACL2 ordinals are
well-founded, see <a href="PROOF-OF-WELL-FOUNDEDNESS.html">proof-of-well-foundedness</a>.<p>

The representation of ordinals changed in ACL2 Version_2.8, and is due to
Pete Manolios and Daron Vroon.  They have also defined algorithms for ordinal
arithmetic, created a library of theorems to reason about ordinal arithmetic,
and written the rest of this documentation in order to explain this change.
We thank them for their efforts.  Although they have provided the
implementation and even modified the distributed books and workshop books as
needed, we have looked over their work and are maintaining it (and this
documentation); if there are any bugs, they should be considered ours (Matt
Kaufmann and J Moore).<p>

A book is included for compatibility with the representation before
Version_2.8.  For books that contain events relying on the previous ordinal
implementation, insert the following lines before the first such event:

<pre>
(include-book "ordinals/e0-ordinal" :dir :system)
(set-well-founded-relation e0-ord-&lt;)
</pre>
<p>

The new ordinal representation is based on a slightly different version of
Cantor Normal Form than that used by the old ordinals.  An advantage of the
new representation is that it is exponentially more succinct than the old
representation.<p>

While pre-Version_2.8 ACL2 versions provided built-in functions for checking
if an object is an ordinal and for comparing two ordinals, they did not
provide support for reasoning about and constructing ordinals.  The books in
the directory <code>books/ordinals</code> provide such support.  First, they provide
efficient algorithms for ordinal arithmetic (including addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and exponentiation).  The algorithms and their complexity are
described in the following paper.

</pre>

Second, the algorithms are mechanically verified and libraries of theorems
which can be used to automate reasoning involving the ordinals are provided.

We now describe aspects of the above mentioned books in more detail.<p>

The new ordering function is <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> and the new ordinal recognizer is
<code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>.  See also <code><a href="NATP.html">natp</a></code>, <code><a href="POSP.html">posp</a></code>, <code><a href="O_lt_=.html">o&lt;=</a></code>, <code><a href="O_gt_.html">o&gt;</a></code>, <code><a href="O_gt_=.html">o&gt;=</a></code>,
<code><a href="O-FIRST-EXPT.html">o-first-expt</a></code>, <code><a href="O-FIRST-COEFF.html">o-first-coeff</a></code>, <code><a href="O-RST.html">o-rst</a></code>, <code><a href="MAKE-ORD.html">make-ord</a></code>,
<code><a href="O-FINP.html">o-finp</a></code>, and <code><a href="O-INFP.html">o-infp</a></code>. 
<p>
The old ordinals were based on the following formulation of Cantor Normal
Form:<p>

For any ordinal, <code>a &lt; epsilon-0</code>, there exist natural numbers <code>p</code> and
<code>n</code>, and ordinals <code>a1 &gt;= a2 &gt;= ... &gt;= an &gt; 0</code> such that <code>a &gt; a1</code>
and <code>a = w^(a1) + w^(a2) + ... + w^(an) + p</code>.<p>

Thus, a predicate recognizing ACL2's old ordinals is given by the following
definition.

<pre>
(defun e0-ordinalp (x)
  (if (consp x)
      (and (e0-ordinalp (car x))
           (not (equal (car x) 0))
           (e0-ordinalp (cdr x))
           (or (atom (cdr x))
               (not (e0-ord-&lt; (car x) (cadr x)))))
    (and (integerp x)
         (&gt;= x 0))))
</pre>

The new representation is based on a corollary to the above theorem, which we
get by the left distributive property of ordinal multiplication over ordinal
addition. Thus, <code>w^a + w^a = (w^a)2</code>, <code>w^a + w^a + w^a = (w^a)3</code> and so
forth. The corollary is as follows:<p>

For any ordinal, <code>a &lt; epsilon-0</code>, there exist natural numbers <code>p</code>
and <code>n</code>, positive integers <code>x1, x2, ..., xn</code> and ordinals
<code>a1 &gt; a2 &gt; ... &gt; an &gt; 0</code> such that <code>a &gt; a1</code> and 
<code>a = w^(a1)x1 + w^(a2)x2 + ... + w^(an)xn + p</code>.<p>

Instead of representing an ordinal as a list of non-increasing ordinals, we
represent it as a list of exponent-coefficient pairs, such that the exponents
are strictly decreasing (see <a href="O-P.html">o-p</a>).  Note that this representation is
exponentially more efficient than the old representation.<p>

The ordinal arithmetic functions: <code>o+</code>, <code>o-</code>, <code>o*</code>, and <code>o^</code> are
defined in the ordinals library (in the subdirectory <code>books/ordinals</code>). To
use them, include the book <code>ordinals-without-arithmetic</code> or <code>ordinals</code>,
depending on whether you want the arithmetic books included or not
(<code>ordinals</code> includes <code>books/arithmetic/top-with-meta</code>). To use the old
ordinals, include the book <code>e0-ordinal</code> and run the command
<code>(set-well-founded-relation e0-ord-&lt;)</code><p>

The file <code>books/arithmetic/natp-posp</code> is a book for reasoning
about <code>posp</code> and <code>natp</code>.  We recommend using this book if you
have to reason about <code>posp</code> and <code>natp</code>.  It is included in
<code>books/arithmetic/top</code>, which is included in
<code>books/arithmetic/top-with-meta</code>, which is included in
<code>books/ordinals/ordinals</code>.<p>

If you have a good reason to use the old definitions of the ordinals (e.g.,
because of legacy code and theorems), then we provide a convenient way to do
this.  In the book <code>ordinal-isomorphism</code> we prove that the new ordinals are
order-isomorphic to the old ordinals and thus theorems proved in one context
can be directly transferred to the other.  For an example of how to do this,
look at the book <code>defmul</code> in the directory
<code>books/workshops/2000/ruiz/multiset</code>.<p>

The ordinals books have been used to prove non-trivial theorems.  For a good
example, see the books in the directory
<code>books/workshops/2003/sustik/support</code>, where Matyas Sustik proves Dickson's
lemma.<p>

Finally, many termination proofs can be carried out with weaker orderings
than the ordinals up to <code>epsilon-0</code>.  For example, many inductive theorem
provers only know that the lexicographic ordering on natural numbers is
well-founded.  The book <code>lexicographic-ordering</code> contains a definition of
such an ordering <code>l&lt;</code> whose arguments are either a list of natural numbers,
or a natural number.  In the book we prove that <code>l&lt;</code> is well-founded (that
is, we prove a <code>:well-founded-relation</code> <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> and provide a macro
<code>llist</code> to simplify the generation of measure functions.  We also show how
to use <code>l&lt;</code> to prove that the famous Ackermann function terminates.
Finally, since <code>l&lt;</code> does something reasonable with natural numbers, it gets
along with <code><a href="ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a></code>, the default measure chosen by ACL2.
