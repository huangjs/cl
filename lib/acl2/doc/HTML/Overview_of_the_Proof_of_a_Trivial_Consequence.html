<a href="The_WARNING_about_the_Trivial_Consequence.html">ACL2 Warning</a> [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE ...):  The previously
added rule ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-APP subsumes the newly proposed :REWRITE
rule TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE, in the sense that the old rule rewrites a
more general target.  Because the new rule will be tried first, it
may nonetheless find application.<p>

By the simple :rewrite rule <a href="The_First_Application_of_the_Associativity_Rule.html">ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-APP</a> we reduce the conjecture
to<p>

(EQUAL (APP X1

But we reduce the conjecture to T, by primitive type reasoning.<p>
