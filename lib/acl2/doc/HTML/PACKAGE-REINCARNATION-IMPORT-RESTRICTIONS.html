<h2>PACKAGE-REINCARNATION-IMPORT-RESTRICTIONS</h2>re-defining undone <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s

Suppose <code>(defpkg "pkg" imports)</code> is the most recently executed
successful definition of <code>"pkg"</code> in this ACL2 session and that it
has since been undone, as by <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT.html">ubt</a></code>.  Any future attempt in this
session to define <code>"pkg"</code> as a package must specify an identical
imports list.
<p>
The restriction stems from the need to implement the reinstallation
of saved logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s as in error recovery and the <code>:</code><code><a href="OOPS.html">oops</a></code> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.
Suppose that the new <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> attempts to import some symbol, <code>a::sym</code>,
not imported by the previous definition of <code>"pkg"</code>.  Because it was
not imported in the original package, the symbol <code>pkg::sym</code>, different
from <code>a::sym</code>, may well have been created and may well be used in some
saved <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s.  Those saved <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s are Common Lisp objects being held
for you ``behind the scenes.''  In order to import <code>a::sym</code> into
<code>"pkg"</code> now we would have to unintern <code>pkg::sym</code>, rendering those
saved <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s ill-formed.  It is because of saved <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>s that we do
not actually clear out a package when it is undone.<p>

At one point we thought it was sound to allow the new <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> to
import a subset of the old.  But that is incorrect.  Suppose the old
definition of <code>"pkg"</code> imported <code>a::sym</code> but the new one does not.
Suppose we allowed that and implemented it simply by setting the
imports of <code>"pkg"</code> to the new subset.  Then consider the conjecture
<code>(eq a::sym pkg::sym)</code>.  This ought not be a theorem because we did
not import <code>a::sym</code> into <code>"pkg"</code>.  But in fact in AKCL it is a theorem
because <code>pkg::sym</code> is read as <code>a::sym</code> because of the old imports.
