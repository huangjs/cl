<h2>PC</h2>print the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> described by a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="HISTORY.html">HISTORY</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
:pc 3    ; print the third command executed
:pc :max ; print the most recent command
:pc :x   ; print the most recent command
:pc fn   ; print the command that introduced fn
</pre>

See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.
<p>
<code>Pc</code> takes one argument, a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor, and prints the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>
identified by that descriptor.  See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.  For
example

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:pc foo
 LVd     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
</pre>

<code>Pc</code> always prints a space first, followed by three (possibly blank)
<a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> (``LVd'' above) explained below.  Then <code>pc</code> prints the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> number, a number uniquely identifying the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>'s position
in the sequence of <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s since the beginning of the user's
session.  Finally, the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> itself is printed.<p>

While <code>pc</code> always prints a space first, some <a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s, for
example <code>:</code><code><a href="PCS.html">pcs</a></code> and <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code>, use the first column of output to delimit a
region of <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s or to point to a particular event within a
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.<p>

For example, <code>:pcs 52 54</code> will print something like

<pre>
/LVd     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
 LV      53 (DEFUN BAR (X) (CONS X X))
\        54 (DEFTHM FOO-BAR (EQUAL (CAR (BAR X)) (FOO X)))
          : ...
        127 (DEFUN LATEST (X) X)
</pre>

Here, the two slash <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> in the first column are intended to
suggest a bracket delimiting <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s 52 through 54.  The last
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> printed by <code><a href="PCS.html">pcs</a></code> is always the most recent <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>, i.e., the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> at <code>:here</code>, and is separated from the rest of the display by
an elipsis if some <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s are omitted.<p>

Similarly, the <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> will print a particular event within a
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> block and will indicate that event by printing a ``<code><a href="_gt_.html">&gt;</a></code>'' in
the first column.  The symbol is intended to be an arrow pointing at
the event in question.<p>

For example, <code>:</code><code><a href="PE.html">pe</a></code> <code>true-listp-app</code> might print:

<pre>
         1 (INCLUDE-BOOK "list-book")
            \
&gt;           (DEFTHM TRUE-LISTP-APP
                    (EQUAL (TRUE-LISTP (APP A B)) (TRUE-LISTP B)))
</pre>

using the arrow to indicate the event itself.  The slash printed
to connect the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>, <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>, with the event, <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>, is
intended to suggest a tree branch indicating that the event is
inferior to (and part of) the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.<p>

The mysterious three <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> sometimes preceding a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> have
the following interpretations.  The first two have to do with the
function symbols introduced by the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> and are blank if no
symbols were introduced.<p>

At any time we can classify our function symbols into three disjoint
sets, which we will here name with <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>.  The ``<code>P</code>''
functions are those in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode.  The ``<code>L</code>'' functions are
those in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode whose <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not been verified.  The
``<code>V</code>'' functions are those in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode whose <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s have
been verified.  Note that <code><a href="VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></code> and <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code>
cause function symbols to be reclassified.  If a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> introduces
function symbols then the first mysterious character indicates the
class of the symbols at the time of introduction and the second
character indicates the current class of the symbols (if the current
class is different from the introductory class).<p>

Thus, the display

<pre>
 PLd     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
</pre>

tells us that <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> 52 introduced a <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> function but that
some <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> after 52 changed its mode to <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> and that the
<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of <code>foo</code> have not been verified.  That is, <code>foo</code>'s
termination has been verified even though it was not verified as
part of the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> that introduced <code>foo</code>.  Had a subsequent
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> verified the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s of <code>foo</code>, the display would contain a
<code>V</code> where the <code>L</code> is.<p>

The display

<pre>
 P d     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
</pre>

indicates that <code>foo</code> was introduced in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode and still
is in that mode.<p>

The third character indicates the enabled/disabled status of the
<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s introduced by the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  If the status character is blank
then all the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s (if any) introduced are <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d.  If the status
character is ``<code>D</code>'' then some <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s were introduced and they are
all <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.  If the status character is ``<code>d</code>'' then at least
one, but not all, of the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s introduced is <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.  Thus, in the
display

<pre>
 L d     52 (DEFUN FOO (X) X)
</pre>

we see that some <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> introduced by <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> 52 is <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.  As
noted in the documentation for <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>, a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>
introduces many <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s, e.g., the axiomatic definition rule,
<code>(:definition fn)</code>, the executable counterpart rule,
<code>(:executable-counterpart fn)</code>, and <a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>s,
<code>(:type-prescription fn)</code>.  The display above does not say which of
the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s based on <code>foo</code> is <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d, but it does tell us one of
them is; see <a href="DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a> for how to obtain the disabled runes for
a given function symbol.
