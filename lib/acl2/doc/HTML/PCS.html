<p>
<code>Pcs</code> takes two arguments, both of which are <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors, and
prints the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s between them with <code><a href="PC.html">pc</a></code>.  The order of the two
descriptors is irrelevant.  See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a> for a
description of <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors.  See <a href="PC.html">pc</a> for a description
of the format in which <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s are displayed.
