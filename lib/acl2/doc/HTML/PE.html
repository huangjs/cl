<h2>PE</h2>print the events named by a logical name
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="HISTORY.html">HISTORY</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
:pe fn   ; sketches the command that introduced fn and
         ; prints in full the event within it that created fn.
</pre>

See <a href="LOGICAL-NAME.html">logical-name</a>.
<p>
<code>Pe</code> takes one argument, a logical name, and prints in full the event
corresponding to the name.  <code>Pe</code> also sketches the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> responsible
for that event if the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> is different from the event itself.
See <a href="PC.html">pc</a> for a description of the format used to display a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  To
remind you that the event is inferior to the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>, i.e., you can only
undo the entire <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>, not just the event, the event is indented
slightly from the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> and a slash (meant to suggest a tree branch)
connects them.<p>

If the given logical name corresponds to more than one event, then <code>:pe</code>
will print the above information for every such event.  Here is an
example. of such behavior.

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;:pe nth
      -4270  (ENCAPSULATE NIL ...)
             \
&gt;V            (VERIFY-TERMINATION NTH)<p>

Additional events for the logical name NTH:
 PV   -4949  (DEFUN NTH (N L)
                    "Documentation available via :doc"
                    (DECLARE (XARGS :GUARD (AND (INTEGERP N)
                                                (&gt;= N 0)
                                                (TRUE-LISTP L))))
                    (IF (ENDP L)
                        NIL
                        (IF (ZP N)
                            (CAR L)
                            (NTH (- N 1) (CDR L)))))
