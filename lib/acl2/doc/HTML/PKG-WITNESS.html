<h2>PKG-WITNESS</h2>return a specific symbol in the indicated package
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">PROGRAMMING</a>

For any string <code>pkg</code> that names a package currently known to ACL2,
<code>(pkg-witness pkg)</code> is a symbol in that package whose <code><a href="SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></code> is
the value of constant <code>*pkg-witness-name*</code>.  Logically, this is the case
even if the package is not currently known to ACL2.  However, if
<code>pkg-witness</code> is called on a string that is not the name of a package known
to ACL2, a hard Lisp error will result.
<p>
<code>(Pkg-witness pkg)</code> has a guard of
<code>(and (stringp pkg) (not (equal pkg "")))</code>.  If <code>pkg</code> is not a string,
then <code>(pkg-witness pkg)</code> is equal to <code>(pkg-witness "ACL2")</code>
