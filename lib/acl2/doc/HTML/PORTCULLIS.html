<h2>PORTCULLIS</h2>the gate guarding the entrance to a certified book
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BOOKS.html">BOOKS</a>
</pre><p>

The certificate (see <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for general information) of a
certified file is divided into two parts, a portcullis and a
<a href="KEEP.html">keep</a>.  These names come from castle lore.  The portcullis of a
castle is an iron grate that slides up through the ceiling of the
tunnel-like entrance.  The portcullis of a book ensures that
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> does not start to read the book until the
appropriate context has been created.
<p>
Technically, the portcullis consists of the <a href="VERSION.html">version</a> number of
the certifying ACL2, a list of <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s used to create the
``certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>'' and an alist specifying the check sums
of all the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> included in that <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  The portcullis
is constructed automatically by <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> from the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>
in which <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> is called, but that <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> must have
certain properties described below.  After listing the properties we
discuss the issues in a more leisurely manner.<p>

Each <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> in the portcullis must be either a <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> form or an
embedded event form (see <a href="EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).<p>

Consider a book to be certified.  The book is a file containing
event forms.  Suppose the file contains references to such symbols
as <code>my-pkg::fn</code> and <code>acl2-arith::cancel</code>, but that the book itself
does not create the packages.  Then a hard Lisp error would be
caused merely by the attempt to read the expressions in the book.
The corresponding <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s cannot be written into the book itself
because the book must be compilable and Common Lisp compilers differ
on the rules concerning the inline definition of new packages.  The
only safe course is to make all <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s occur outside of compiled
files.<p>

More generally, when a book is certified it is certified within some
logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  That ``certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>'' contains not only
the necessary <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s but also, perhaps, function and constant
definitions and maybe even references to other <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>.  When
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> creates the <a href="CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for a file it recovers
from the certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s used to create that
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> from the initial ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Those <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s become
part of the portcullis for the certified book.  In addition,
<code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code> records in the portcullis the check sums
(see <a href="CHECK-SUM.html">check-sum</a>) of all the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> included in the certification
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.<p>

<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></code> presumes that it is impossible even to read the
contents of a certified book unless the portcullis can be
``raised.'' To raise the portcullis we must be able to execute
(possibly redundantly, but certainly without error), all of the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s in the portcullis and then verify that the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> thus
included were identical to those used to build the certification
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> (up to check sum).  This raising of the portcullis must
be done delicately since <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>s are present: we cannot even read
a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> in the portcullis until we have successfully executed the
previous ones, since packages are being defined.<p>

Clearly, a book is most useful if it is certified in the most
elementary extension possible of the initial logic.  If, for
example, your certification <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> happens to contain a
<code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> for <code>"MY-PKG"</code> and the function <code>foo</code>, then those
definitions become part of the portcullis for the book.  Every time
the book is included, those names will be defined and will have to
be either new or redundant (see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>).  But if
those names were not necessary to the certification of the book,
their presence would unnecessarily restrict the utility of the book.<p>
