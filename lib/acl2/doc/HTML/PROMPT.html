<h2>PROMPT</h2>the prompt printed by <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>

The prompt printed by ACL2 conveys information about various ``modes.''
See <a href="DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a> and see <a href="LD-PROMPT.html">ld-prompt</a> for details.<p>

The prompt during raw Lisp breaks is, with most Common Lisp implementations,
adjusted by ACL2 to include the string <code>"[RAW LISP</code>"], in order to
reminder users not to submit ACL2 forms there; see <a href="BREAKS.html">breaks</a>.  For Lisps that
seem to use the same code for printing prompts at the top-level as in
<a href="BREAKS.html">breaks</a>, the top-level prompt is similarly adjusted.  For Lisps with the
above prompt adjustment, The following forms may be executed in raw Lisp
(i.e., after typing <code>:q</code>).

<pre>
(install-new-raw-prompt) ; install prompt with [RAW LISP] as described above
(install-old-raw-prompt) ; revert to original prompt from host Common Lisp
