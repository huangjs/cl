<h2>PROOF-OF-WELL-FOUNDEDNESS</h2>a proof that <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> is well-founded on <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>

The soundness of ACL2 rests in part on the well-foundedness of <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> on
<code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s.  This can be taken as obvious if one is willing to grant that
those concepts are simply encodings of the standard mathematical notions of
the ordinals below <code>epsilon-0</code> and its natural ordering relation.  But it
is possible to prove that <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> is well-founded on <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s without
having to assert any connection to the ordinals and that is what we do here.
The book <code>books/ordinals/proof-of-well-foundedness</code> carries out the proof
outlined below in ACL2, using only that the natural numbers are
well-founded.
<p>
Before outlining the above mentioned proof, we note that in the analogous
documentation page of ACL2 Version_2.7, there is a proof of the
well-foundedness of <code>e0-ord-&lt;</code> on <code>e0-ordinalp</code>s, the less-than relation
and recognizer for the old ordinals (that is, for the ordinals appearing in
ACL2 up through that version).  Manolios and Vroon have given a proof in ACL2
Version_2.7 that the current ordinals (based on <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> and <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>) are
order-isomorphic to the old ordinals (based on <code>e0-ord-&lt;</code> and
<code>e0-ordinalp</code>).  Their proof establishes that switching from the old
ordinals to the current ordinals preserves the soundness of ACL2.  For
details see their paper:

We now give an outline of the above mentioned proof of well-foundedness.  We
first observe three facts about <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> on ordinals that have been proved by
ACL2 using only structural induction on lists.  These theorems can be proved
by hand.

<pre>
(defthm transitivity-of-o&lt;
  (implies (and (o&lt; x y)
                (o&lt; y z))
           (o&lt; x z))
  :rule-classes nil)<p>

(defthm non-circularity-of-o&lt;
  (implies (o&lt; x y)
           (not (o&lt; y x)))
  :rule-classes nil)<p>

(defthm trichotomy-of-o&lt;
  (implies (and (o-p x)
                (o-p y))
           (or (equal x y)
               (o&lt; x y)
               (o&lt; y x)))
  :rule-classes nil)
</pre>

These three properties establish that <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> orders the
<code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s.  To put such a statement in the most standard
mathematical nomenclature, we can define the macro:

<pre>
(defmacro o&lt;= (x y)
  `(not (o&lt; ,y ,x)))
</pre>

and then establish that <code>o&lt;=</code> is a relation that is a simple,
complete (i.e., total) order on ordinals by the following three
lemmas, which have been proved:

<pre>
(defthm antisymmetry-of-o&lt;=
  (implies (and (o-p x)
                (o-p y)
                (o&lt;= x y)
                (o&lt;= y x))
           (equal x y))
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :use non-circularity-of-o&lt;)))<p>

(defthm transitivity-of-o&lt;=
  (implies (and (o-p x)
                (o-p y)
                (o&lt;= x y)
                (o&lt;= y z))
           (o&lt;= x z))
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :use transitivity-of-o&lt;)))<p>

(defthm trichotomy-of-o&lt;=
  (implies (and (o-p x)
                (o-p y))
           (or (o&lt;= x y)
               (o&lt;= y x)))
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :use trichotomy-of-o&lt;)))
</pre>

Crucially important to the proof of the well-foundedness of
<code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> on <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s is the concept of ordinal-depth,
abbreviated <code>od</code>:

<pre>
(defun od (l)
  (if (o-finp l) 
      0 
    (1+ (od (o-first-expt l)))))
</pre>

If the <code>od</code> of an <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code> <code>x</code> is smaller than that of an
<code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code> <code>y</code>, then <code>x</code> is <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> <code>y</code>:

<pre>
(defun od-1 (x y)
  (if (o-finp x)
      (list x y)
    (od-1 (o-first-expt x) (o-first-expt y))))<p>

(defthm od-implies-ordlessp
  (implies (and (o-p x)
                (&lt; (od x) (od y)))
           (o&lt; x y))
  :hints (("Goal"
           :induct (od-1 x y))))
</pre>

Remark.  A consequence of this lemma is the fact that if <code>s = s(1)</code>,
<code>s(2)</code>, ... is an infinite, <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> descending sequence of <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s, then
<code>od(s(1))</code>, <code>od(s(2))</code>, ... is a ``weakly'' descending sequence of
non-negative integers: <code>od(s(i))</code> is greater than or equal to
<code>od(s(i+1))</code>.<p>

<em>Lemma Main.</em>  For each non-negative integer <code>n</code>, <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> well-orders
the set of <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s with <code>od</code> less than or equal to <code>n</code> .

<pre>
 Base Case.  n = 0.  The o-ps with 0 od are the non-negative
 integers.  On the non-negative integers, o&lt; is the same as &lt;.<p>

 Induction Step.  n &gt; 0.  We assume that o&lt; well-orders the
 o-ps with od less than n.<p>

   If o&lt; does not well-order the o-ps with od less than or equal to n,
   consider, D, the set of infinite, o&lt; descending sequences of o-ps of od
   less than or equal to n.  The first element of a sequence in D has od n.
   Therefore, the o-first-expt of the first element of a sequence in D has od
   n-1.  Since o&lt;, by IH, well-orders the o-ps with od less than n, the set
   of o-first-expts of first elements of the sequences in D has a minimal
   element, which we denote by B and which has od of n-1.<p>

   Let k be the minimum integer such that for some infinite, o&lt; descending
   sequence s of o-ps with od less than or equal to n, the first element of s
   has an o-first-expt of B and an o-first-coeff of k.  Notice that k is
   positive.<p>

   Having fixed B and k, let s = s(1), s(2), ... be an infinite, o&lt;
   descending sequence of o-ps with od less than or equal to n such that s(1)
   has a o-first-expt of B and an o-first-coeff of k.<p>

   We show that each s(i) has a o-first-expt of B and an o-first-coeff of
   k. For suppose that s(j) is the first member of s either with o-first-expt
   B and o-first-coeff m (m neq k) or with o-first-expt B' and o-first-coeff
   B' (B' neq B). If (o-first-expt s(j)) = B', then B' has od n-1 (otherwise,
   by IH, s would not be infinite) and B' is o&lt; B, contradicting the
   minimality of B. If 0 &lt; m &lt; k, then the fact that the sequence beginning
   at s(j) is infinitely descending contradicts the minimality of k. If m &gt;
   k, then s(j) is greater than its predecessor; but this contradicts the
   fact that s is descending.<p>

   Thus, by the definition of o&lt;, for s to be a decreasing sequence of o-ps,
   (o-rst s(1)), (o-rst s(2)), ... must be a decreasing sequence. We end by
   showing this cannot be the case. Let t = t(1), t(2), ... be an infinite
   sequence of o-ps such that t(i) = (o-rst s(i)). Then t is infinitely
   descending. Furthermore, t(1) begins with an o-p B' that is o&lt; B. Since t
   is in D, t(1) has od n, therefore, B' has od n-1. But this contradicts the
   minimality of B. Q.E.D.

Theorem.  <code><a href="O_lt_.html">o&lt;</a></code> well-orders the <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s.  Proof.  Every
infinite,<code> o&lt;</code> descending sequence of <code><a href="O-P.html">o-p</a></code>s has the
property that each member has <code>od</code> less than or equal to the 
<code>od</code>, <code>n</code>, of the first member of the sequence.  This 
contradicts Lemma Main.
