A view of ACL2 proofs may be obtained by way of ``proof tree
displays.''  The emacs environment is easily customized to provide
window-based proof tree displays that assist in traversing and
making sense of the proof transcript; see <a href="PROOF-TREE-EMACS.html">proof-tree-emacs</a>.
Proof tree displays may be turned on with the command <code>:</code><code><a href="START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a></code>
and may be turned off with the command <code>:</code><code><a href="STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a></code>;
see <a href="START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a> and see <a href="STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a>.

Here is an example of a proof tree display, with comments.  Lines
marked with ``c'' are considered ``checkpoints,'' i.e., goals whose
scrutiny may be of particular value.

<pre>
( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)    ;currently proving PLUS-TREE-DEL
   1 Goal preprocess   ;"Goal" creates 1 subgoal by preprocessing
   2 |  Goal' simp     ;"Goal'" creates 2 subgoals by simplification
c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1   ;"Subgoal 2" pushes "*1" for INDUCT
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ;first pass thru waterfall completed
c  6 *1 INDUCT                 ;Proof by induction of "*1" has
     |  &lt;5 more subgoals&gt;      ; created 6 top-level subgoals.  At
                               ; this point, one of those 6 has been
                               ; proved, and 5 remain to be proved.
                               ; We are currently working on the
                               ; first of those 5 remaining goals.
</pre>

See <a href="PROOF-TREE-EXAMPLES.html">proof-tree-examples</a> for many examples that contain proof
tree displays.  But first, we summarize the kinds of lines that may
appear in a proof tree display.  The simplest form of a proof tree
display is a header showing the current event, followed by list of
lines, each having one of the following forms.

<pre>
    n &lt;goal&gt; &lt;process&gt; ...
</pre>

Says that the indicated goal created <code>n</code> subgoals using the
indicated process.  Here ``...'' refers to possible additional
information.

<pre>
c   n &lt;goal&gt; &lt;process&gt; ...
</pre>

As above, but calls attention to the fact that this goal is a
``checkpoint'' in the sense that it may be of particular interest.
Some displays may overwrite ``c'' with ``&gt;'' to indicate the current
checkpoint being shown in the proof transcript.

<pre>
     |  &lt;goal&gt; ...
     |  |  &lt;k subgoals&gt;
</pre>

Indicates that the goal just above this line, which is pointed to
by the rightmost vertical bar (``|''), has <code>k</code> subgoals, none of which
have yet been processed.

<pre>
     |  &lt;goal&gt; ...
     |  |  &lt;k more subgoals&gt;
</pre>

As above, except that some subgoals have already been processed.

<pre>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
</pre>

Separates successive passes through the ``waterfall''.  Thus, this
``fencepost'' mark indicates the start of a new proof by induction
or of a new forcing round.<p>

turn off proof tree displays or to turn them back on again,
see <a href="STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a> and see <a href="START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a>,
respectively. See <a href="CHECKPOINT-FORCED-GOALS.html">checkpoint-forced-goals</a> to learn how to mark
goals as checkpoints that <a href="FORCE.html">force</a> the creation of goals in forcing
rounds.  Finally, see <a href="PROOF-TREE-DETAILS.html">proof-tree-details</a> for some points not
covered elsewhere.
