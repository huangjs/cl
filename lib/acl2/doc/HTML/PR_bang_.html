<h2>PR!</h2>print rules stored by the command with a given command descriptor
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="HISTORY.html">HISTORY</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:<p>

:pr! fn ; prints the rules from the definition of fn (including any
        ; :type-prescription rule and :definition rule), as well as all other
        ; rules created by the command that created by fn (which could be
        ; many rules if, for example, fn was defined by an include-book
        ; command).<p>

:pr! :max ; prints all the rules stored by the most recent command
</pre>

<p>
Also see <a href="PR.html">pr</a>, which is similar but works at the event level
instead of at the command level.<p>

<code><a href="PR.html">Pr</a></code> takes one argument, a command descriptor, and prints the rules
created by the corresponding event.  In each case it prints the
rune, the current enabled/disabled status, and other appropriate
fields from the rule.  See <a href="PR.html">pr</a> for further details.
