<h2>PSEUDO-TERMP</h2>a predicate for recognizing term-like s-expressions
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example Forms:
(pseudo-termp '(car (cons x 'nil)))      ; has value t
(pseudo-termp '(car x y z))              ; also has value t!
(pseudo-termp '(delta (h x)))            ; has value t
(pseudo-termp '(delta (h x) . 7))        ; has value nil (not a true-listp)
(pseudo-termp '((lambda (x) (car x)) b)) ; has value t
(pseudo-termp '(if x y 123))             ; has value nil (123 is not quoted)
(pseudo-termp '(if x y '123))            ; has value t
</pre>

If <code>x</code> is the quotation of a term, then <code>(pseudo-termp x)</code> is <code>t</code>.
However, if <code>x</code> is not the quotation of a term it is not necessarily
the case that <code>(pseudo-termp x)</code> is <code>nil</code>.
<p>
See <a href="TERM.html">term</a> for a discussion of the various meanings of the word
``term'' in ACL2.  In its most strict sense, a term is either a
legal variable symbol, a quoted constant, or the application of an
<code>n</code>-ary function symbol or closed <code>lambda</code>-expression to <code>n</code> terms.  By
``legal variable symbol'' we exclude constant symbols, such as <code>t</code>,
<code>nil</code>, and <code>*ts-rational*</code>.  By ``quoted constants'' we include <code>'t</code> (aka
<code>(quote t)</code>), <code>'nil</code>, <code>'31</code>, etc., and exclude constant names such as <code>t</code>,
<code>nil</code> and <code>*ts-rational*</code>, unquoted constants such as <code>31</code> or <code>1/2</code>, and
ill-formed <code>quote</code> expressions such as <code>(quote 3 4)</code>.  By ``closed
lambda expression'' we exclude expressions, such as
<code>(lambda (x) (cons x y))</code>, containing free variables in their bodies.
Terms typed by the user are translated into strict terms for
internal use in ACL2.<p>

The predicate <code>termp</code> checks this strict sense of ``term'' with
respect to a given ACL2 logical world; See <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  Many ACL2
functions, such as the rewriter, require certain of their arguments
to satisfy <code>termp</code>.  However, as of this writing, <code>termp</code> is in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>
mode and thus cannot be used effectively in conjectures to be
proved.  Furthermore, if regarded simply from the perspective of an
effective <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> for a term-processing function, <code>termp</code> checks many
irrelevant things.  (Does it really matter that the variable symbols
encountered never start and end with an asterisk?)  For these
reasons, we have introduced the notion of a ``pseudo-term'' and
embodied it in the predicate <code>pseudo-termp</code>, which is easier to
check, does not require the logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> as input, has <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>
mode, and is often perfectly suitable as a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> on term-processing
functions.<p>

A <code>pseudo-termp</code> is either a symbol, a true list of length 2
beginning with the word <code>quote</code>, the application of an <code>n</code>-ary
pseudo-<code>lambda</code> expression to a true list of <code>n</code> pseudo-terms, or
the application of a symbol to a true list of <code>n</code> <code>pseudo-termp</code>s.
By an ``<code>n</code>-ary pseudo-<code>lambda</code> expression'' we mean an expression
of the form <code>(lambda (v1 ... vn) pterm)</code>, where the <code>vi</code> are
symbols (but not necessarily distinct legal variable symbols) and
<code>pterm</code> is a <code>pseudo-termp</code>.<p>

Metafunctions may use <code>pseudo-termp</code> as a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>.
