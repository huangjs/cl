<h2>PUFF*</h2>replace a compound <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> by its subevents

ACL2 !&gt;:puff* 15
ACL2 !&gt;:puff* "book"
<p>
General Form:
:puff* cd
</pre>

where <code>cd</code> is a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor (see <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>) for
a ``puffable'' <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  See <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a> for the definition of
``puffable'' and for a description of the basic act of ``puffing'' a
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  <code>Puff*</code> is just the recursive application of <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a>.  <code>Puff*</code>
prints the region <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a>ed, using <code><a href="PCS.html">pcs</a></code>.<p>

To <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a> a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> is to replace it by its immediate subevents, each
of which is executed as a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  To <code>puff*</code> a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> is to replace
the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> by each of its immediate subevents and then to <code>puff*</code>
each of the puffable <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s among the newly introduced ones.<p>

For example, suppose <code>"ab"</code> is a book containing the following

<pre>
(in-package "ACL2")
(include-book "a")
(include-book "b")
</pre>

Suppose that book <code>"a"</code> only contained <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>s for the functions <code>a1</code>
and <code>a2</code> and that <code>"b"</code> only contained <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>s for <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code>.<p>

Now consider an ACL2 <a href="STATE.html">state</a> in which only two <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s have been
executed, the first being <code>(include-book "ab")</code> and the second being
<code>(include-book "c")</code>.  Thus, the relevant part of the display
produced by <code>:</code><code><a href="PBT.html">pbt</a></code> 1 would be:

<pre>
1 (INCLUDE-BOOK "ab")
2 (INCLUDE-BOOK "c")
</pre>

Call this <a href="STATE.html">state</a> the ``starting <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' in this example, because we
will refer to it several times.<p>

Suppose <code>:puff 1</code> is executed in the starting <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.  Then the first
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> is replaced by its immediate subevents and <code>:pbt 1</code> would
show:

<pre>
1 (INCLUDE-BOOK "a")
2 (INCLUDE-BOOK "b")
3 (INCLUDE-BOOK "c")
</pre>

Contrast this with the execution of <code>:puff* 1</code> in the starting
<a href="STATE.html">state</a>.  <code>Puff*</code> would first <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a> <code>(include-book "ab")</code> to get the
<a href="STATE.html">state</a> shown above.  But then it would recursively <code>puff*</code> the puffable
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s introduced by the first <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a>.  This continues recursively
as long as any <a href="PUFF.html">puff</a> introduced a puffable <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.  The end result
of <code>:puff* 1</code> in the starting <a href="STATE.html">state</a> is

<pre>
1 (DEFUN A1 ...)
2 (DEFUN A2 ...)
3 (DEFUN B1 ...)
4 (DEFUN B2 ...)
5 (INCLUDE-BOOK "c")
</pre>

Observe that when <code>puff*</code> is done, the originally indicated <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>,
<code>(include-book "ab")</code>, has been replaced by the corresponding
sequence of primitive <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  Observe also that puffable <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s
elsewhere in the <a href="HISTORY.html">history</a>, for example, <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> 2 in the starting
<a href="STATE.html">state</a>, are not affected (except that their <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> numbers grow as a
result of the splicing in of earlier <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s).
