<h2>REDO-FLAT</h2>redo up through a failure in an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code>
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>

When one submits an <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> event and one of its
sub-events fails, ACL2 restores its logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> as though the
<code>encapsulate</code> or <code>progn</code> had not been run.  But sometimes one would like
to debug the failure by re-executing all sub-events that succeeded up to the
point of failure, and then re-executing the failed sub-event.  Said
differently, imagine that the top-level <code>encapsulate</code> or <code>progn</code> form, as
well as all such sub-forms, were flattened into a list of events that were
then submitted to ACL2 up to the point of failure.  This would put us in the
state in which the original failed event had failed, so we could now submit
that failed event and try modifying it, or first proving additional events,
in order to get it admitted.<p>

<code>Redo-flat</code> is provided for this purpose.  Consider the following (rather
nonsensical) example, in which the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> of <code>f3</code> fails (the body is
<code>y</code> but the formal parameter list is <code>(x)</code>).

<pre>
(encapsulate
 ()
 (defun f1 (x) x)
 (encapsulate ()
              (local (defthm hack (equal (car (cons x y)) x))))
 (encapsulate ()
              (local (defthm hack (equal (+ x y) (+ y x)))))
 (encapsulate ()
              (make-event '(defun f2 (x) x))
              (progn (defthm foo (equal x x) :rule-classes nil)
                     (defun f3 (x) y)))
 (defun f4 (x) x)
 (defun f5 (x) y))
</pre>

After this attempt fails, you can evaluate the following form.

<pre>
(redo-flat)
</pre>

This will first lay down a <code><a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></code> event, <code>(deflabel r)</code>, so that
you can eventually remove your debugging work with <code>(:ubt! r)</code>.  Then the
successful sub-events that preceded the failure will be executed with proofs
skipped (so that this execution is fast).  Then, the failed event will be
executed.  Finally, a <code>:</code><code><a href="PBT.html">pbt</a></code> command is executed so that you can see
a summary of the events that executed successfully.<p>

You can eliminate some of the steps above by supplying keyword values, as
follows.

<pre>
(redo-flat
 :succ  succ ; Skip the successful sub-events if val is nil.
 :fail  fail ; Skip the failed sub-event if val is nil.
 :label lab  ; Skip deflabel if lab or succ is nil, else use (deflabel lab).
 :pbt   val  ; Skip the final :pbt if val, lab, or succ is nil.
 )
</pre>

Also, you can avoid skipping proofs for the successful sub-events by
supplying keyword <code>:succ-ld-skip-proofsp</code> with a valid value for
<code>ld-skip-proofsp</code>; see <a href="LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a>.<p>

If you prefer only to see the successful and failed sub-events, without any
events being re-executed, you may evaluate the following form instead.

<pre>
(redo-flat :show t)
</pre>

For the example above, this command produces the following output.

<pre><p>

List of events (from encapsulate or progn) preceding the failure:<p>

((DEFUN F1 (X) X)
 (ENCAPSULATE NIL
              (LOCAL (DEFTHM HACK (EQUAL (CAR (CONS X Y)) X))))
 (ENCAPSULATE NIL
              (LOCAL (DEFTHM HACK (EQUAL (+ X Y) (+ Y X)))))
 (MAKE-EVENT '(DEFUN F2 (X) X))
 (DEFTHM FOO (EQUAL X X)
         :RULE-CLASSES NIL))<p>

Failed event:<p>

(DEFUN F3 (X) Y)
ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<code>Redo-flat</code> uses a scheme that should not cause spurious name conflicts for
<code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> events.  Above, it is mentioned that events are ``flattened'';
now we clarify this notion.  Each sub-event that succeeds and is an
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> is left intact.  Only such events that fail
are replaced by their component events.  Thus, in the example above, there is
no conflict between the two <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> sub-events named ``<code>hack</code>,''
because these are contained in successful <code>encapsulate</code> sub-events, which
are therefore not flattened.  The <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code> and two <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>
events surrounding the definition of <code>f3</code> are, however, flattened, because
that definition failed to be admitted.<p>

Unfortunately, an event must actually fail in order for <code>redo-flat</code> to
work.  So if the system is ``stuck'' on an event, then you may find it
helpful to insert an illegal event just in front of it before submitting the
<code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> or <code><a href="PROGN.html">progn</a></code>.
