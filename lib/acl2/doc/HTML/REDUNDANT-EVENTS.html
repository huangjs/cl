<h2>REDUNDANT-EVENTS</h2>allowing a name to be introduced ``twice''
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>

Sometimes an event will announce that it is ``redundant''.  When
this happens, no change to the logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> has occurred.  This
happens when the logical name being defined is already defined and
has exactly the same definition, from the logical point of view.
This feature permits two independent <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>, each of which defines
some name, to be included sequentially provided they use exactly the
same definition.
<p>
When are two <a href="LOGICAL-NAME.html">logical-name</a> definitions considered exactly the same?
It depends upon the kind of name being defined.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></code> event is never redundant.  This means that if you have a
<code><a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></code> in a book and that book has been included (without error),
then references to that label denote the point in <a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> at which
the book introduced the label.  See the note about shifting logical
names, below.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> or <code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code> (or <code><a href="DEFUNS.html">defuns</a></code>) event is redundant
if for each function to be introduced, there has already been introduced a
function with the same name, the same formals, and syntactically identical
<code>:</code><code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a></code>, <code>:measure</code>, type declarations, <code><a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a></code><code>s</code>
declarations and <code>body</code> (before macroexpansion), and an appropriate
<code>mode</code> (see the discussion of ``appropriate <code>mode</code>s'' below).
Exceptions: (1) If either definition is declared <code>:non-executable</code>
(see <a href="XARGS.html">xargs</a>), then the two events must be identical.  (2) It is permissible
for one definition to have a <code>:</code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> of <code>t</code> and the other to have
no explicit guard (hence, the guard is implicitly <code>t</code>).  (3) The
<code>:measure</code> check is avoided if we are skipping proofs (for example, during
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>), and otherwise, the new definition may have a
<code>:measure</code> of <code>(:? v1 ... vk)</code>, where <code>(v1 ... vk)</code> enumerates the
variables occurring in the measure stored for the old definition.<p>

A <code><a href="VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></code> event is redundant if the function has already had
its <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s verified.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> or <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> event is redundant if there is already an axiom
or theorem of the given name and both the formula (after
macroexpansion) and the <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> are syntactically identical.
Note that a <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> can make a subsequent <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> redundant, and a
<code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> can make a subsequent <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code> redundant as well.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></code> is redundant if the name is already defined either with a
syntactically identical <code>defconst</code> event or one that defines it to have the
same value.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code> is redundant if there is already a <code>defstobj</code> event with
the same name that has exactly the same field descriptors (see <a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a>), in
the same order, and with the same <code>:renaming</code> value if <code>:renaming</code> is
supplied for either event.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></code> is redundant if there is already a macro defined with the
same name and syntactically identical arguments, <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, and body.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> is redundant if a package of the same name with exactly the
same imports has been defined.<p>

A <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code> is never redundant.  The ``natural'' notion of
equivalent <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code> forms is that the names and values of the two
theory expressions are the same.  But since most theory expressions are
sensitive to the context in which they occur, it seems unlikely to
us that two <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code>s coming from two sequentially included <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>
will ever have the same values.  So we prohibit redundant theory
definitions.  If you try to define the same theory name twice, you
will get a ``name in use'' error.<p>

An <code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code> event is never redundant because it doesn't define any
name.<p>

A <code><a href="PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a></code> event is redundant if every name supplied is
already a member of the corresponding list of untouchable symbols.<p>

A <code><a href="REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a></code> event is redundant if no name supplied is
a member of the corresponding list of untouchable symbols.<p>

A <code><a href="RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a></code> event is redundant if it does not cause any change.<p>

A <code><a href="SET-BODY.html">set-body</a></code> event is redundant if the indicated body is already the
current body.<p>

<code><a href="TABLE.html">Table</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFDOC.html">defdoc</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> are never redundant because they don't
define any name.<p>

An <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> event is redundant if and only if a syntactically
identical <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> has already been executed under the same
<code><a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a></code>.<p>

An <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is redundant if the book has already been included.<p>

<em>Note About Appropriate Modes:</em><p>

Suppose a function is being redefined and that the formals, guards, types,
stobjs, and bodies are identical.  When are the modes (<code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>
or <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>) ``appropriate?''  Identical modes are appropriate.
But what if the old mode was <code>:program</code> and the new mode is <code>:logic</code>?
This is appropriate, provided the definition meets the requirements of the
logical definitional principle.  That is, you may redefine ``redundantly''
a <code>:program</code> mode function as a <code>:logic</code> mode function provide the
measure conjectures can be proved.  This is what <code><a href="VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></code>
does.  Now consider the reverse style of redefinition.  Suppose the
function was defined in <code>:logic</code> mode and is being identically redefined
in <code>:program</code> mode.  This is inappropriate.  We do not permit the
downgrading of a function from <code>:logic</code> mode to <code>:program</code> mode, since
that might produce a logical world in which there were theorems about a
<code>:program</code> mode function, violating one of ACL2's basic assumptions.<p>

<em>Note About Shifting Logical Names:</em><p>

Suppose a book defines a function <code>fn</code> and later uses <code>fn</code> as a logical
name in a theory expression.  Consider the value of that theory
expression in two different sessions.  In session A, the book is
included in a <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> in which <code>fn</code> is not already defined, i.e., in a
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> in which the book's definition of <code>fn</code> is not redundant.  In
session B, the book is included in a <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> in which <code>fn</code> is already
identically defined.  In session B, the book's definition of <code>fn</code> is
redundant.  When <code>fn</code> is used as a logical name in a theory
expression, it denotes the point in <a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> at which <code>fn</code> was
introduced.  Observe that those points are different in the two
sessions.  Hence, it is likely that theory expressions involving <code>fn</code>
will have different values in session A than in session B.<p>

This may adversely affect the user of your book.  For example,
suppose your book creates a theory via <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code> that is advertised
just to contain the names generated by the book.  But suppose you
compute the theory as the very last event in the book using:

<pre>
(set-difference-theories (universal-theory :here) 
                         (universal-theory fn))
</pre>

where <code>fn</code> is the very first event in the book and happens to be a
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> event.  This expression returns the advertised set if <code>fn</code> is
not already defined when the book is included.  But if <code>fn</code> were
previously (identically) defined, the theory is larger than
advertised.<p>

The moral of this is simple: when building <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> that other people
will use, it is best to describe your <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> in terms of logical
names that will not shift around when the <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> are included.  The
best such names are those created by <code><a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></code>.<p>

<em>Note About Unfortunate Redundancies:</em><p>

Notice that our syntactic criterion for redundancy of <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>
does not allow redefinition to take effect unless there is a syntactic change
in the definition.  The following example shows how an attempt to redefine a
function can fail to make any change.

<pre>
(set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
(defmacro mac (x) x)
(defun foo (x) (mac x))
(defmacro mac (x) (list 'car x))
(defun foo (x) (mac x)) ; redundant, unfortunately; foo does not change
(thm (equal (foo 3) 3)) ; succeeds, showing that redef of foo didn't happen
</pre>

The call of macro <code>mac</code> was expanded away when the first definition of
<code>foo</code> was processed, so the new definition of <code>mac</code> is not seen in
<code>foo</code> unless <code>foo</code> is redefined; yet our attempt at redefinition failed!
An easy workaround is first to supply a different definition of <code>foo</code>, just
before the last definition of <code>foo</code> above.  Then that final definition will
no longer be redundant.<p>

The phenomenon illustrated above can occur even without macros.  Here is a
more complex example, based on one supplied by Grant Passmore.

<pre>
(defun n3 () 0)
(defun n4 () 1)
(defun n5 () (&gt; (n3) (n4))) ; body is normalized to nil
(thm (equal (n5) nil)) ; succeeds, trivially
(set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
(defun n3 () 2)
</pre>

If now we execute <code>(thm (equal (n5) nil))</code>, it still succeeds even though
we expect <code>(n5)</code> = <code>(&gt; (n3) (n4))</code> = <code>(&gt; 2 1)</code> = <code>t</code>.  That is
because the body of <code>n5</code> was normalized to <code>nil</code>.  (Such normalization
can be avoided; see the brief discussion of <code>:normalize</code> in the
documentation for <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>.)  So, given this unfortunate situation, one
might expect at this point simply to redefine <code>n5</code> using the same
definition as before, in order to pick up the new definition of <code>n3</code>.  Such
``redefinition'' would, however, be redundant, for the same reason as in the
previous example:  no syntactic change was made to the definition.  The same
workaround applies as before: redefine <code>n5</code> to be something different, and
then redefine <code>n5</code> again to be as desired.<p>

A related phenomenon can occur for <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>.  As explained above, an
<code>encapsulate</code> event is redundant if it is identical to one already in the
database.  Consider then the following contrived example.

<pre>
(encapsulate () (defun foo (x) x))
(set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
(defun foo (x) (cons x x))
(encapsulate () (defun foo (x) x)) ; redundant!
</pre>

The last <code>encapsulate</code> event is redundant because it meets the criterion
for redundancy: it is identical to the earlier <code>encapsulate</code> event.  A
workaround can be to add something trivial to the <code>encapsulate</code>, for
example:

<pre>
(encapsulate () 
  (deflabel try2) ; ``Increment'' to try3 next time, and so on.
  (defun foo (x) x))
</pre>
<p>

The examples above are suggestive but by no means exhaustive.  Consider the
following example.

<pre>
(defstub f1 () =&gt; *)
(set-ld-redefinition-action '(:warn . :overwrite) state)
(defun f1 () 3)
(defstub f1 () =&gt; *) ; redundant -- has no effect
</pre>

The reason that the final <code><a href="DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a></code> is redundant is that <code>defstub</code> is
a macro that expands to a call of <code>encapsulate</code>; so this is very similar to
the immediately preceding example.<p>
