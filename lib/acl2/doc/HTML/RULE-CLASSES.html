<h1>RULE-CLASSES</h1>adding rules to the data base
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="acl2-doc-major-topics.html">ACL2 Documentation</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
General Form:
a true list of rule class objects as defined below<p>

Special Cases:
a symbol abbreviating a single rule class object
</pre>

ACL2 provides users with the ability to create a number of
different kinds of rules, including (conditional) rewrite rules but
also including others.  Don't be put off by the long description to
follow; usually, you'll probably want to use rewrite rules.  More on
this below.<p>

A rule class object is either one of the <code>:class</code> keywords or else is
a list of the form shown below.  Those fields marked with ``(!)''
are required when the <code>:class</code> is as indicated.

<pre>
(:class 
  :COROLLARY term
  :TRIGGER-FNS (fn1 ... fnk) ; provided :class = :META (!)
  :TRIGGER-TERMS (t1 ... tk) ; provided :class = :FORWARD-CHAINING
                             ;       or :class = :LINEAR
  :TYPE-SET n                ; provided :class = :TYPE-SET-INVERTER
  :TYPED-TERM term           ; provided :class = :TYPE-PRESCRIPTION
  :CLIQUE (fn1 ... fnk)      ; provided :class = :DEFINITION
  :CONTROLLER-ALIST alist    ; provided :class = :DEFINITION
  :INSTALL-BODY directive    ; provided :class = :DEFINITION
  :LOOP-STOPPER alist        ; provided :class = :REWRITE
  :PATTERN term              ; provided :class = :INDUCTION (!)
  :CONDITION term            ; provided :class = :INDUCTION
  :SCHEME term               ; provided :class = :INDUCTION (!)
  :MATCH-FREE all-or-once    ; provided :class = :REWRITE
                                     or :class = :LINEAR
                                     or :class = :FORWARD-CHAINING
  :BACKCHAIN-LIMIT-LST limit ; provided :class = :REWRITE
                                     or :class = :META
                                     or :class = :LINEAR
  :HINTS hints               ; provided instrs = nil
  :INSTRUCTIONS instrs       ; provided  hints = nil
  :OTF-FLG flg)
</pre>

When rule class objects are provided by the user, most of the
fields are optional and their values are computed in a context
sensitive way.  When a <code>:class</code> keyword is used as a rule class
object, all relevant fields are determined contextually.  Each rule
class object in <code>:rule-classes</code> causes one or more rules to be added
to the data base.  The <code>:class</code> keywords are documented individually
under the following names.  Note that when one of these names is used
as a <code>:class</code>, it is expected to be in the keyword package (i.e., the
names below should be preceded by a colon but the ACL2 <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
facilities do not permit us to use keywords below).<p>

Before we get into the discussion of rule classes, let us return to
an important point.  In spite of the large variety of rule classes
available, at present we recommend that new ACL2 users rely almost
exclusively on (conditional) rewrite rules.  A reasonable but
slightly bolder approach is to use <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> and
<code>:</code><code><a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></code> rules for ``type-theoretic'' rules, especially
ones whose top-level function symbol is a common one like
<code><a href="TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></code> or <code><a href="CONSP.html">consp</a></code>; see <a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> and
see <a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a>.  However, the rest of the rule classes
are really not intended for widespread use, but rather are mainly
for experts.<p>

We expect that we will write more about the question of which kind
of rule to use.  For now:  when in doubt, use a <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rule.<p>

<code>:Rule-classes</code> is an optional keyword argument of the <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> (and
<code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code>) event.  In the following, let <code>name</code> be the name of the
event and let <code>thm</code> be the formula to be proved or added as an axiom.<p>

If <code>:rule-classes</code> is not specified in a <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> (or <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code>) event,
it is as though <code>:rule-classes</code> <code>((:rewrite))</code> had been used.  Use
<code>:rule-classes</code> <code>nil</code> to specify that no rules are to be generated.<p>

If <code>:rule-classes</code> class is specified, where class is a non-<code>nil</code>
symbol, it is as though <code>:rule-classes</code> <code>((class))</code> had been used.
Thus, <code>:rule-classes</code> <code>:</code><code><a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></code> is equivalent to <code>:rule-classes</code>
<code>((:forward-chaining))</code>.<p>

We therefore now consider <code>:rule-classes</code> as a true list.  If any
element of that list is a keyword, replace it by the singleton list
containing that keyword.  Thus, <code>:rule-classes</code> <code>(:rewrite :elim)</code> is
the same as <code>:rule-classes</code> <code>((:rewrite) (:elim))</code>.<p>

Each element of the expanded value of <code>:rule-classes</code> must be a true
list whose <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> is one of the rule class keyword tokens listed above,
e.g., <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="ELIM.html">elim</a></code>, etc., and whose <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code> is a ``keyword alist''
alternately listing keywords and values.  The keywords in this alist
must be taken from those shown below.  They may be listed in any
order and most may be omitted, as specified below.
<blockquote><p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">Corollary</a></code> -- its value, <code>term</code>, must be a term.  If omitted, this
field defaults to <code>thm</code>.  The <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> of a rule class object is the
formula actually used to justify the rule created and thus
determines the form of the rule.  Nqthm provided no similar
capability: each rule was determined by <code>thm</code>, the theorem or axiom
added.  ACL2 permits <code>thm</code> to be stated ``elegantly'' and then allows
the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> of a rule class object to specify how that elegant
statement is to be interpreted as a rule.  For the rule class object
to be well-formed, its (defaulted) <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code>, <code>term</code>, must follow
from <code>thm</code>.  Unless <code>term</code> is trivially implied by <code>thm</code>, using little
more than propositional logic, the formula <code>(implies thm term)</code> is
submitted to the theorem prover and the proof attempt must be
successful.  During that proof attempt the values of <code>:</code><code><a href="HINTS.html">hints</a></code>,
<code>:</code><code><a href="INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a></code>, and <code>:</code><code><a href="OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></code>, as provided in the rule class object,
are provided as arguments to the prover.  Such auxiliary proofs give
the sort of output that one expects from the prover.  However, as
noted above, corollaries that follow trivially are not submitted to
the prover; thus, such corollaries cause no prover output.<p>

Note that before <code>term</code> is stored, all calls of macros in it are
expanded away.  See <a href="TRANS.html">trans</a>.<p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="HINTS.html">Hints</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></code> -- the values of these fields must
satisfy the same restrictions placed on the fields of the same names
in <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>.  These values are passed to the recursive call of the
prover used to establish that the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> of the rule class
object follows from the theorem or axiom <code>thm</code>.<p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-SET.html">Type-set</a></code> -- this field may be supplied only if the <code>:class</code> is
<code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-SET-INVERTER.html">type-set-inverter</a></code>.  When provided, the value must be a type-set, an
integer in a certain range.  If not provided, an attempt is made to
compute it from the corollary.  See <a href="TYPE-SET-INVERTER.html">type-set-inverter</a>.<p>

<code>:Typed-term</code> -- this field may be supplied only if the <code>:class</code> is
<code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code>.  When provided, the value is the term for which
the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> is a type-prescription lemma.  If no <code>:typed-term</code> is
provided in a <code>:</code><code><a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></code> rule class object, we try to
compute heuristically an acceptable term.
See <a href="TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>.<p>

<code>:Trigger-terms</code> -- this field may be supplied only if the <code>:class</code> is
<code>:</code><code><a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></code> or <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code>.  When provided, the value is a list of
terms, each of which is to trigger the attempted application of the
rule.  If no <code>:trigger-terms</code> is provided, we attempt to compute
heuristically an appropriate set of triggers.
See <a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> or see <a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a>.<p>

<code>:Trigger-fns</code> -- this field must (and may only) be supplied if the
<code>:class</code> is <code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code>.  Its value must be a list of function symbols.
Terms with these symbols trigger the application of the rule.
See <a href="META.html">meta</a>.<p>

<code>:Clique</code> and <code>:controller-alist</code> -- these two fields may only
be supplied if the <code>:class</code> is <code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code>.  If they are omitted,
then ACL2 will attempt to guess them.  Suppose the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> of
the rule is <code>(implies hyp (equiv (fn a1 ... an) body))</code>.  The value of
the <code>:clique</code> field should be a true list of function symbols, and if
non-<code>nil</code> must include <code>fn</code>.  These symbols are all the members of the
mutually recursive clique containing this definition of <code>fn</code>.  That
is, a call of any function in <code>:clique</code> is considered a ``recursive
call'' for purposes of the expansion heuristics.  The value of the
<code>:controller-alist</code> field should be an alist that maps each function
symbol in the <code>:clique</code> to a list of <code>t</code>'s and <code>nil</code>'s of length equal to
the arity of the function.  For example, if <code>:clique</code> consists of just
two symbols, <code>fn1</code> and <code>fn2</code>, of arities <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> respectively, then
<code>((fn1 t nil) (fn2 nil t t))</code> is a legal value of <code>:controller-alist</code>.
The value associated with a function symbol in this alist is a
``mask'' specifying which argument slots of the function ``control''
the recursion for heuristic purposes.  Sloppy choice of <code>:clique</code> or
<code>:controller-alist</code> can result in infinite expansion and stack
overflow.<p>

<code>:Install-body</code> -- this field may only be supplied if the <code>:class</code> is
<code>:</code><code><a href="DEFINITION.html">definition</a></code>.  Its value must be <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code>, or the default,
<code>:normalize</code>.  A value of <code>t</code> or <code>:normalize</code> will cause ACL2 to
install this rule as the new body of the function being ``defined'' (<code>fn</code>
in the paragraph just above); hence this definition will be installed for
future <code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Furthermore, if this field is omitted or the
value is <code>:normalize</code>, then this definition will be simplified using the
so-called ``normalization'' procedure that is used when processing
definitions made with <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>.  You must explicitly specify
<code>:install-body nil</code> in the following cases: <code>fn</code> (as above) is a member
of the value of constant <code>*definition-minimal-theory*</code>, the arguments are
not a list of distinct variables, <code>equiv</code> (as above) is not <code><a href="EQUAL.html">equal</a></code>, or
there are free variables in the hypotheses or right-hand side
(see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>).  However, supplying <code>:install-body nil</code> will not
affect the rewriter's application of the <code>:definition</code> rule, other than to
avoid using the rule to apply <code>:expand</code> hints.  If a definition rule
equates <code>(f a1 ... ak)</code> with <code>body</code> but there are hypotheses, <code>hyps</code>,
then <code>:expand</code> <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> will replace terms <code>(f term1 ... termk)</code> by
corresponding terms <code>(if hyps body (hide (f term1 ... termk)))</code>.<p>

<code>:</code><code><a href="LOOP-STOPPER.html">Loop-stopper</a></code> -- this field may only be supplied if the class is
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>.  Its value must be a list of entries each consisting of
two variables followed by a (possibly empty) list of functions, for
example <code>((x y binary-+) (u v foo bar))</code>.  It will be used to restrict
application of rewrite rules by requiring that the list of instances
of the second variables must be ``smaller'' than the list of
instances of the first variables in a sense related to the
corresponding functions listed; see <a href="LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>.  The list as
a whole is allowed to be <code>nil</code>, indicating that no such restriction
shall be made.  Note that any such entry that contains a variable
not being instantiated, i.e., not occurring on the left side of the
rewrite rule, will be ignored.  However, for simplicity we merely
require that every variable mentioned should appear somewhere in the
corresponding <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> formula.<p>

<code>:Pattern</code>, <code>:Condition</code>, <code>:Scheme</code> -- the first and last of these fields
must (and may only) be supplied if the class is <code>:</code><code><a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a></code>.
<code>:Condition</code> is optional but may only be supplied if the class is
<code>:</code><code><a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a></code>.  The values must all be terms and indicate,
respectively, the pattern to which a new induction scheme is to be
attached, the condition under which the suggestion is to be made,
and a term which suggests the new scheme.  See <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a>.<p>

<code>:Match-free</code> -- this field must be <code>:all</code> or <code>:once</code> and may be
supplied only if the <code>:class</code> is either <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>,
<code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code>, or <code>:</code><code><a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></code>.  See <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a> for a
description of this field.  Note: Although this field is intended to be used
for controlling retries of matching free variables in hypotheses, it is
legal to supply it even if there are no such free variables.  This can
simplify the automated generation of rules, but note that when
<code>:match-free</code> is supplied, the warning otherwise provided for the presence
of free variables in hypotheses will be suppressed.<p>

<code>Backchain-limit-lst</code> -- this field may be supplied only if
the <code>:class</code> is either <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code>, or
<code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code> and only one rule is generated from the formula.  Its
value must be <code>nil</code>; a non-negative integer; or, except in the case of
<code>:</code><code><a href="META.html">meta</a></code> rules, a true list each element of which is either <code>nil</code>
or a non-negative integer.  If it is a list, its length must be equal to the
number of hypotheses of the rule and each item in the list is the
``backchain limit'' associated with the corresponding hypothesis.  If
<code>backchain-limit-lst</code> is a non-negative integer, it is defaulted to a list
of the appropriate number of repetions of that integer.  The backchain limit
of a hypothesis is used to limit the effort that ACL2 will expend when
relieving the hypothesis.  If it is <code>NIL</code>, no new limits are imposed; if
it is an integer, the hypothesis will be limited to backchaining at most
that many times.  Note that backchaining may be further limited by a global
<code>backchain-limit</code>; see <a href="BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> for details.  For a different way
to reign in the rewriter, see <a href="REWRITE-STACK-LIMIT.html">rewrite-stack-limit</a>.  Jared Davis has pointed
out that you can set this field to 0 to avoid any attempt to relieve
<code><a href="FORCE.html">force</a></code>d hypotheses, which can lead to a significant speed-up in some cases.<p>

</blockquote>
Once <code>thm</code> has been proved (in the case of <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>) and each rule
class object has been checked for well-formedness (which might
require additional proofs), we consider each rule class object in
turn to generate and add rules.  Let <code>:class</code> be the class keyword
token of the <code>i</code>th class object (counting from left to right).
Generate the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> <code>(:class name . x)</code>, where <code>x</code> is <code>nil</code> if there is only
one class and otherwise <code>x</code> is <code>i</code>.  Then, from the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> of that
object, generate one or more rules, each of which has the name
<code>(:class name . x)</code>.  See the <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> entry for each rule class to see
how formulas determine rules.  Note that it is in principle possible
for several rules to share the same name; it happens whenever a
<code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> determines more than one rule.  This in fact only occurs
for <code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a></code>, and <code>:</code><code><a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></code> class rules and only
then if the <code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> is essentially a conjunction.  (See the
documentation for <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or
<a href="FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> for details.)
