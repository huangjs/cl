<h2>SAVE-EXEC</h2>save an executable image and (for most Common Lisps) a wrapper script
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="OTHER.html">OTHER</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="SAVING-AND-RESTORING.html">saving-and-restoring</a> for an explanation of why one might want to use this
function.

<pre>
Examples:
; Save an executable named my-saved_acl2:
(save-exec "my-saved_acl2"
           "This saved image includes Version 7 of Project Foo.")<p>

; Same as above, but with a generic comment instead:
(save-exec "my-saved_acl2" nil)
<p>
General Form:
(save-exec exec-filename extra-startup-string)
</pre>

where <code>exec-filename</code> is the filename of the proposed executable and
<code>extra-startup-string</code> is a non-empty string to be printed after the normal
ACL2 startup message when you start up the saved image.  However,
<code>extra-startup-string</code> is allowed to be <code>nil</code>, in which case a generic
string will be printed instead.<p>

<strong>Note</strong>: For technical reasons, we require that you first execute <code>:q</code>, to
exit the ACL2 read-eval-print loop, before evaluating a <code>save-exec</code> call.<p>

For most Common Lisps, the specified file (e.g., <code>"my-saved_acl2"</code> in the
examples above) will be written as a small script, which in turn invokes a
saved image to which an extension has been appended (e.g.,
<code>my-saved_acl2.gcl</code> for the examples above, when the underlying Common Lisp
is GCL on a non-Windows system).
