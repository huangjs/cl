<h2>SAVING-AND-RESTORING</h2>saving and restoring your logical state

One normally works on an ACL2-based project by developing <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a>, which
can then be included when continuing on that project in later ACL2 sessions;
see <a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>.  However, this approach can be time-consuming when there
are very large collections of <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> to be included.  See see <a href="SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a>
for the description of a utility that saves your ACL2 state so that you can
immediately re-start later in that same state.
