<h2>SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST</h2>control output
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="OTHER.html">OTHER</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
(set-inhibit-output-lst '(warning))
(set-inhibit-output-lst '(proof-tree prove proof-checker))
:set-inhibit-output-lst (proof-tree prove)
<p>
General Form:
(set-inhibit-output-lst lst)
</pre>

where <code>lst</code> is a form (which may mention <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>) that evaluates
to a list of names, each of which is the name of one of the
following ``kinds'' of output produced by ACL2.

<pre>
  error          error messages
  warning        warnings other than those related to soundness
  warning!       warnings (of all degrees of importance)
  observation    observations
  prove          commentary produced by the theorem prover
  proof-checker  commentary produced by the proof-checker
  event          non-proof commentary produced by events such as defun
                 and encapsulate
  expansion      commentary produced by make-event expansion
  summary        the summary at the successful conclusion of an event
  proof-tree     proof-tree output
</pre>

It is possible to inhibit each kind of output by putting the
corresponding name into <code>lst</code>.  For example, if <code>'warning</code> is
included in (the value of) <code>lst</code>, then no warnings are printed
except those related to soundness, e.g., the inclusion of an 
uncertified book.  Note that <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> output is affected by
<code>set-inhibit-output-lst</code>; see <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.<p>

Printing of events on behalf of <code><a href="CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></code>, <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code>,
or <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code> is inhibited when both <code>'event</code> and <code>'prove</code>
belong to <code>lst</code>.  Otherwise, printing of events is controlled by
the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> special <code><a href="LD-PRE-EVAL-PRINT.html">ld-pre-eval-print</a></code>.
