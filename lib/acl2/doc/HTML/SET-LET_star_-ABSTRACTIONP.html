<h2>SET-LET*-ABSTRACTIONP</h2>to shorten many prettyprinted clauses
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>

Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event summary
but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> and is so
recorded.  Moreover, its effect is to set the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>, and
hence its effect is <code><a href="LOCAL.html">local</a></code> to the book or <code><a href="ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></code> form
containing it; see <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.<p>

When this flag is set to <code>t</code>, subterms that occur more than once in
a clause are abstracted away with <code><a href="LET_star_.html">let*</a></code>, generally shortening
the displayed size of the clauses.  This flag only affects how
clauses are printed.  It does not change what terms the theorem
prover manipulates.
<p>

<pre>
:set-let*-abstractionp t ;;; or, (set-let*-abstractionp t)
</pre>

will cause the prettyprinter to do ``let* abstraction'' on clauses
before they are printed.  The algorithm finds the maximal
multiply-occuring subterm and extracts it, binding it to some new
variable and replacing its occurrences by that variable.  This produces
a <code>let*</code> form.  This process is iterated until no subterm occurs more
than once.  This process generally takes a little time, but less time
than to print large clauses.  The process can greatly reduce the amount of
text produced by the prover.<p>

THIS ONLY AFFECTS HOW THE CLAUSES ARE PRINTED!  The unabstracted
clauses are manipulated by the theorem prover.<p>


<pre>
:set-let*-abstractionp nil
</pre>

restores normal clause printing.<p>

The mode is stored in the defaults table, See <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.
Thus, the mode may be set locally in books.
