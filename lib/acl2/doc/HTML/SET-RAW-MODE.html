ACL2 users often find its careful syntax checking to be helpful during code
development.  Sometimes it is even useful to do code development in
<code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode, where ACL2 can be used to check termination of
(mutually) recursive functions, verify guards, or even prove properties of
the functions.<p>

However, loading code using <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> is much slower than using
Common Lisp <code>load</code> in raw Lisp, and in this sense ACL2 can get in the way
of efficient execution.  Unfortunately, it is error-prone to use ACL2 sources
(or their compilations) in raw Lisp, primarily because a number of ACL2
primitives will not let you do so.  Perhaps you have seen this error message
when trying to do so:

<pre>
HARD ACL2 ERROR in ACL2-UNWIND-PROTECT:  Apparently you have tried
to execute a form in raw Lisp that is only intended to be executed
inside the ACL2 loop.
</pre>

Even without this problem it is important to enter the ACL2 loop (see <a href="LP.html">lp</a>),
for example in order to set the <code><a href="CBD.html">cbd</a></code> and (to get more technical) the
readtable.<p>

ACL2 provides a ``raw mode'' for execution of raw Lisp forms.  In this mode,
<code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> reduces essentially to a Common Lisp <code>load</code>.  More
generally, the ACL2 logical <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> is not routinely extended in raw mode
(some sneaky tricks are probably required to make that happen).  To turn raw
mode off or on:

<pre>
:set-raw-mode t   ; turn raw mode on
:set-raw-mode nil ; turn raw mode off
</pre>

<p>
<ul>
<li><h3><a href="ADD-RAW-ARITY.html">ADD-RAW-ARITY</a> -- add arity information for raw mode
</h3>
</li>

<li><h3><a href="REMOVE-RAW-ARITY.html">REMOVE-RAW-ARITY</a> -- remove arity information for raw mode
</h3>
</li>

</ul>

The way you can tell that you are in raw mode is by looking at the prompt
(see <a href="DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a>), which uses a capital ``<code>P</code>'' (suggesting
something like program mode, but more so).

<pre>
ACL2 P&gt;
</pre>
<p>

Typical benefits of raw mode are fast loading of source and compiled files
and the capability to hack arbitrary Common Lisp code in an environment with
the ACL2 sources loaded (and hence with ACL2 primitives available).  In
addition, ACL2 hard errors will put you into the Lisp debugger, rather than
returning you to the ACL2 loop, and this may be helpful for debugging;
see <a href="HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a> and see <a href="ILLEGAL.html">illegal</a>, but also see <a href="BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a>.  However, it
probably is generally best to avoid raw mode unless these advantages seem
important.  We expect the main benefit of raw mode to be in deployment of
applications, where load time is much faster than the time required for a
full-blown <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code>, although in certain cases the fast loading of
books and treatment of hard errors discussed above may be useful during
development.<p>

Raw mode is also useful for those who want to build extensions of ACL2.  For
example, the following form can be put into a certifiable book to load an
arbitrary Common Lisp source or compiled file.

<pre>
(progn! (defttag my-application)
        (set-raw-mode t)
        (load "some-file"))
</pre>

Also see <code>with-raw-mode</code> defined in <code>books/misc/hacker.lisp</code>,
see <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>, and see <a href="PROGN_bang_.html">progn!</a>.<p>

Below are several disadvantages to raw mode.  These should discourage users
from using it for general code development, as <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode is
generally preferable.

<pre>
-- Forms are in essence executed in raw Lisp.  Hence:
   -- Syntax checking is turned off; and
   -- Guard checking is completely disabled.
-- Table events, including <code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>, are ignored, as are many
   other <code><a href="EVENTS.html">events</a></code>, including <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> and <code><a href="COMP.html">comp</a></code>.
-- Soundness claims are weakened for any ACL2 session in which raw
   mode was ever entered; see <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>.
-- The normal undoing mechanism (see <a href="UBT.html">ubt</a>) is not supported.
</pre>
<p>

We conclude with some details.<p>

<em>Printing results</em>.  The rules for printing results are unchanged for raw
mode, with one exception.  If the value to be printed would contain any Lisp
object that is not a legal ACL2 object, then the <code>print</code> routine is used
from the host Lisp, rather than the usual ACL2 printing routine.  The
following example illustrates the printing used when an illegal ACL2 object
needs to be printed.  Notice how that ``command conventions'' are observed
(see <a href="LD-POST-EVAL-PRINT.html">ld-post-eval-print</a>); the ``<code>[Note</code>'' occurs one space over in the
second example, and no result is printed in the third example.

<pre>
ACL2 P&gt;(find-package "ACL2")
[Note:  Printing non-ACL2 result.]
#&lt;The ACL2 package&gt; 
ACL2 P&gt;(mv nil (find-package "ACL2") state)
 [Note:  Printing non-ACL2 result.]
#&lt;The ACL2 package&gt; 
ACL2 P&gt;(mv t (find-package "ACL2") state)
ACL2 P&gt;(mv 3 (find-package "ACL2"))
[Note:  Printing non-ACL2 result.]
(3 #&lt;The ACL2 package&gt;) 
ACL2 P&gt;
</pre>

If you have trouble with large structures being printed out, you might want
to execute appropriate Common Lisp forms in raw mode, for example,
<code>(setq *print-length* 5)</code> and <code>(setq *print-level* 5)</code>.<p>

<em>Packages</em>.  Raw mode disallows the use of <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code>.  If you want to
create a new package, first exit raw mode with <code>:set-raw-mode nil</code>;
you can subsequently re-enter raw mode with <code>:set-raw-mode t</code> if you
wish.
