<h2>SIGNATURE</h2>how to specify the arity of a constrained function
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
((hd *) =&gt; *)
((printer * state) =&gt; (mv * * state))
((mach * mach-state * state) =&gt; (mv * mach-state)<p>

General Form:
((fn ...) =&gt; *)
((fn ...) =&gt; stobj)
or
((fn ...) =&gt; (mv ...))
</pre>
<p>

where <code>fn</code> is the constrained function symbol, <code>...</code> is a list
of asterisks and/or the names of single-threaded objects and
<code>stobj</code> is a single-threaded object name.  ACL2 also supports an
older style of signature described below after we describe the
preferred style.
<p>
Signatures specify three syntactic aspects of a function symbol: (1)
the ``arity'' or how many arguments the function takes, (2) the
``multiplicity'' or how many results it returns via <code>MV</code>, and (3)
which of those arguments and results are single-threaded objects and
which objects they are.<p>

For a discussion of single-threaded objects, see <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.  For
the current purposes it is sufficient to know that every single-
threaded object has a unique symbolic name and that <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> is
the name of the only built-in single-threaded object.  All other
stobjs are introduced by the user via <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code>.  An object that
is not a single-threaded object is said to be ``ordinary.''<p>

The general form of a signature is <code>((fn x1 ... xn) =&gt; val)</code>.  So
a signature has two parts, separated by the symbol ``=&gt;''.  The
first part, <code>(fn x1 ... xn)</code>, is suggestive of a call of the
constrained function.  The number of ``arguments,'' <code>n</code>, indicates
the arity of <code>fn</code>.  Each <code>xi</code> must be a symbol.  If a given
<code>xi</code> is the symbol ``*'' then the corresponding argument must be
ordinary.  If a given <code>xi</code> is any other symbol, that symbol must
be the name of a single-threaded object and the corresponding
argument must be that object.  No stobj name may occur twice among the
<code>xi</code>.<p>

The second part, <code>val</code>, of a signature is suggestive of a term and
indicates the ``shape'' of the output of <code>fn</code>.  If <code>val</code> is a
symbol then it must be either the symbol ``*'' or the name of a
single-threaded object.  In either case, the multiplicity of <code>fn</code>
is 1 and <code>val</code> indicates whether the result is ordinary or a
stobj.  Otherwise, <code>val</code> is of the form <code>(mv y1 ... yk)</code>, where
<code>k</code> &gt; 1.  Each <code>yi</code> must be either the symbol ``*'' or the name
of a stobj.  Such a <code>val</code> indicates that <code>fn</code> has multiplicity
<code>k</code> and the <code>yi</code> indicate which results are ordinary and which
are stobjs.  No stobj name may occur twice among the <code>yi</code>.<p>

Finally, a stobj name may appear in <code>val</code> only if appears among the
<code>xi</code>.<p>

Before ACL2 supported user-declared single-threaded objects there
was only one single-threaded object: ACL2's built-in notion of
<code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  The notion of signature supported then gave a special
role to the symbol <code>state</code> and all other symbols were considered
to denote ordinary objects.  ACL2 still supports the old form of
signature, but it is limited to functions that operate on ordinary
objects or ordinary objects and <code>state</code>.<p>


<pre>
Old-Style General Form:
(fn formals result)
</pre>
<p>

where <code>fn</code> is the constrained function symbol, <code>formals</code> is a
suitable list of formal parameters for it, and <code>result</code> is either
a symbol denoting that the function returns one result or else
<code>result</code> is an <code><a href="MV.html">mv</a></code> expression, <code>(mv s1 ... sn)</code>, where
<code>n&gt;1</code>, each <code>si</code> is a symbol, indicating that the function
returns <code>n</code> results.  At most one of the formals may be the symbol
<code>STATE</code>, indicating that corresponding argument must be ACL2's
built-in <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  If <code>state</code> appears in <code>formals</code> then
<code>state</code> may appear once in <code>result</code>.  All ``variable symbols''
other than <code>state</code> in old style signatures denote ordinary
objects, regardless of whether the symbol has been defined to be a
single-threaded object name!<p>

We also support a variation on old style signatures allowing the user
to declare which symbols (besides <code>state</code>) are to be considered
single-threaded object names.  This form is

<pre>
(fn formals result :stobjs names)
</pre>

where <code>names</code> is either the name of a single-threaded object or else
is a list of such names.  Every name in <code>names</code> must have been
previously defined as a stobj via <code>defstobj</code>.
