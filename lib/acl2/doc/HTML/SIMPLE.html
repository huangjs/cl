Example of simple rewrite rule:
(equal (car (cons x y)) x)<p>

Examples of simple definition:
(defun file-clock-p (x) (integerp x))
(defun naturalp (x)
  (and (integerp x) (&gt;= x 0)))

The theorem prover output sometimes refers to ``simple'' definitions
and rewrite rules.  These rules can be used by the preprocessor,
which is one of the theorem prover's ``processes'' understood by the
<code>:do-not</code> hint; see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

The preprocessor expands certain definitions and uses certain
rewrite rules that it considers to be ``fast''.  There are two ways
to qualify as fast.  One is to be an ``abbreviation'', where a
rewrite rule with no hypotheses or loop stopper is an
``abbreviation'' if the right side contains no more variable
occurrences than the left side, and the right side does not call the
functions <code><a href="IF.html">if</a></code>, <code><a href="NOT.html">not</a></code> or <code><a href="IMPLIES.html">implies</a></code>.  Definitions and rewrite rules can
both be abbreviations; the criterion for definitions is similar,
except that the definition must not be recursive.  The other way to
qualify applies only to a non-recursive definition, and applies when
its body is a disjunction or conjunction, according to a perhaps
subtle criterion that is intended to avoid case splits.
