<h3>SLOW-ARRAY-WARNING</h3>a warning issued when <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> are used inefficiently
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="ARRAYS.html">ARRAYS</a>
</pre><p>

If you use ACL2 <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> you may sometimes see a <strong>slow array</strong> warning.
We here explain what that warning means and some likely ``mistakes''
it may signify.
<p>
The discussion in the documentation for <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> defines what we
mean by the semantic value of a name.  As noted there, behind the
scenes ACL2 maintains the invariant that with some names there is
associated a pair consisting of an ACL2 array <code>alist</code>, called the
semantic value of the name, and an equivalent raw lisp array.
Access to ACL2 array elements, as in <code>(aref1 name alist i)</code>, is
executed in constant time when the array alist is the semantic value
of the name, because we can just use the corresponding raw lisp
array to obtain the answer.  <code><a href="ASET1.html">Aset1</a></code> and <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></code> modify the raw lisp
array appropriately to maintain the invariant.<p>

If <code><a href="AREF1.html">aref1</a></code> is called on a name and alist, and the alist is not the
then-current semantic value of the name, the correct result is
computed but it requires linear time because the alist must be
searched.  When this happens, <code><a href="AREF1.html">aref1</a></code> prints a <strong>slow array</strong> warning
message to the comment window.  <code><a href="ASET1.html">Aset1</a></code> behaves similarly because the
array it returns will cause the <strong>slow array</strong> warning every time it is
used.<p>

From the purely logical perspective there is nothing ``wrong'' about
such use of <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> and it may be spurious to print a warning
message.  But because <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> are generally used to achieve
efficiency, the <strong>slow array</strong> warning often means the user's
intentions are not being realized.  Sometimes merely performance
expectations are not met; but the message may mean that the
functional behavior of the program is different than intended.<p>

Here are some ``mistakes'' that might cause this behavior.  In the
following we suppose the message was printed by <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code> about an array
named <code>name</code>.  Suppose the alist supplied <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code> is <code>alist</code>.<p>

(1) <code><a href="COMPRESS1.html">Compress1</a></code> was never called on <code>name</code> and <code>alist</code>.  That is, perhaps
you created an alist that is an <code><a href="ARRAY1P.html">array1p</a></code> and then proceeded to access
it with <code><a href="AREF1.html">aref1</a></code> but never gave ACL2 the chance to create a raw lisp
array for it.  After creating an alist that is intended for use as
an array, you must do <code>(compress1 name alist)</code> and pass the resulting
<code>alist'</code> as the array.<p>

(2) <code>Name</code> is misspelled.  Perhaps the array was compressed under the
name <code>'delta-1</code> but accessed under <code>'delta1</code>?<p>

(3) An <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code> was done to modify <code>alist</code>, producing a new array,
<code>alist'</code>, but you subsequently used <code>alist</code> as an array.  Inspect all
<code>(aset1 name ...)</code> occurrences and make sure that the alist modified
is never used subsequently (either in that function or any other).
It is good practice to adopt the following syntactic style.  Suppose
the alist you are manipulating is the value of the local variable
<code>alist</code>.  Suppose at some point in a function definition you wish to
modify <code>alist</code> with <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code>.  Then write

<pre>
(let ((alist (aset1 name alist i val))) ...)
</pre>

and make sure that the subsequent function body is entirely within
the scope of the <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code>.  Any uses of <code>alist</code> subsequently will refer
to the new alist and it is impossible to refer to the old alist.
Note that if you write

<pre>
 (foo (let ((alist (aset1 name alist i val))) ...)  ; arg 1
      (bar alist))                                  ; arg 2
</pre>

you have broken the rules, because in <code>arg 1</code> you have modified
<code>alist</code> but in <code>arg 2</code> you refer to the old value.  An appropriate
rewriting is to lift the <code><a href="LET.html">let</a></code> out:

<pre>
 (let ((alist (aset1 name alist alist i val)))
   (foo ...                                         ; arg 1
        (bar alist)))                               ; arg 2
</pre>

Of course, this may not mean the same thing.<p>

(4) A function which takes <code>alist</code> as an argument and modifies it with
<code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code> fails to return the modified version.  This is really the same
as (3) above, but focuses on function interfaces.  If a function
takes an array <code>alist</code> as an argument and the function uses <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code> (or
a subfunction uses <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code>, etc.), then the function probably
``ought'' to return the result produced by <code><a href="ASET1.html">aset1</a></code>.  The reasoning
is as follows.  If the array is passed into the function, then the
caller is holding the array.  After the function modifies it, the
caller's version of the array is obsolete.  If the caller is going
to make further use of the array, it must obtain the latest version,
i.e., that produced by the function.
