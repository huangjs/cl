Here is a sequence of ACL2 <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that illustrates the use of ACL2
to make definitions and prove theorems.  We will introduce the
notion of the fringe of a tree, as well as the notion of a leaf of a
tree, and then prove that the members of the fringe are exactly the
leaves.<p>

We begin by defining the fringe of a tree, where we identify
trees simply as <a href="CONS.html">cons</a> structures, with <a href="ATOM.html">atom</a>s at the leaves.  The
definition is recursive, breaking into two cases.  If <code>x</code> is a <a href="CONS.html">cons</a>,
then the <code>fringe</code> of <code>x</code> is obtained by appending together the <code>fringe</code>s
of the <code><a href="CAR.html">car</a></code> and <code><a href="CDR.html">cdr</a></code> (left and right child) of <code>x</code>.  Otherwise, <code>x</code> is an
<a href="ATOM.html">atom</a> and its <code>fringe</code> is the one-element list containing only <code>x</code>.

<pre><p>

  (defun fringe (x)
    (if (consp x)
        (append (fringe (car x))
                (fringe (cdr x)))
      (list x)))<p>

</pre>

Now that <code>fringe</code> has been defined, let us proceed by defining the
notion of an atom appearing as a ``leaf'', with the goal of proving
that the leaves of a tree are exactly the members of its <code>fringe</code>.

<pre><p>

  (defun leaf-p (atm x)
    (if (consp x)
        (or (leaf-p atm (car x))
            (leaf-p atm (cdr x)))
      (equal atm x)))<p>

</pre>

The main theorem is now as follows.  Note that the rewrite rule
below uses the equivalence relation <code><a href="IFF.html">iff</a></code> (see <a href="EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a>)
rather than <code><a href="EQUAL.html">equal</a></code>, since <code><a href="MEMBER.html">member</a></code> returns the tail of the given
list that begins with the indicated member, rather than returning a
Boolean.  (Use <code>:pe member</code> to see the definition of <code><a href="MEMBER.html">member</a></code>.)

<pre><p>

  (defthm leaf-p-iff-member-fringe
    (iff (leaf-p atm x)
         (member-equal atm (fringe x))))<p>

</pre>
