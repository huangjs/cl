<h2>STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1</h2>an example of the use of single-threaded objects
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="STOBJ.html">STOBJ</a>
</pre><p>

Suppose we want to sweep a tree and (1) count the number of interior
nodes, (2) count the number of tips and (3) keep a record of every
tip we encounter that is an integer.  We could use a single-threaded
object as our ``accumulator''.  Such an object would have three
fields, one holding the number of nodes seen so far, one holding the
number of tips, and one holding all the integer tips seen.
<p>
The following event declares <code>counters</code> to be a single-threaded object.

<pre>
(defstobj counters
  (NodeCnt     :type integer :initially 0)
  (TipCnt      :type integer :initially 0)
  (IntTipsSeen :type t       :initially nil))
</pre>

It has three fields, <code>NodeCnt</code>, <code>TipCnt</code>, and <code>IntTipsSeen</code>.
(As always in ACL2, capitalization is irrelevant in simple symbol
names, so the first name could be written <code>nodecnt</code> or
<code>NODECNT</code>, etc.) Those are the name of the accessor functions for
the object.  The corresponding update functions are named
<code>update-NodeCnt</code>, <code>update-TipCnt</code> and <code>update-IntTipsSeen</code>.<p>

If you do not like the default function names chosen above, there is
a feature in the <code><a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></code> event that allows you to specify other
names.<p>

If you want to see the ACL2 definitions of all the functions defined
by this event, look at <a href="STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1-DEFUNS.html">stobj-example-1-defuns</a>.<p>

If, after this event, we evaluate the top-level ``global variable''
<code>counters</code> in the ACL2 read-eval-print loop we get:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;counters
&lt;counters&gt;
</pre>

Note that the value printed is ``<code>&lt;counters&gt;</code>''.  Actually, the
value of <code>counters</code> in the logic is <code>(0 0 NIL)</code>.  But ACL2 always prints
single-threaded objects in this non-informative way because they are
usually so big that to do otherwise would be unpleasant.<p>

Had you tried to evaluate the ``global variable'' <code>counters</code> before
declaring it a single-threaded object, ACL2 would have complained that
it does not support global variables.  So a lesson here is that
once you have declared a new single-threaded object your top-level
forms can reference it.  In versions of ACL2 prior to Version  2.4
the only variable enjoying this status was <code>STATE</code>.  single-threaded
objects are a straightforward generalization of the long-implemented
von Neumann <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> feature of ACL2.<p>

We can access the fields of <code>counters</code> as with:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(NodeCnt counters)
0
ACL2 !&gt;(IntTipsSeen counters)  
NIL
</pre>

and we can set the fields of <code>counters</code> as with:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(update-NodeCnt 3 counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(NodeCnt counters)
3  
</pre>

Observe that when we evaluate an expression that returns a
counter object, that object becomes the ``current value'' of
<code>counters</code>.  <p>

Here is a function that ``converts'' the <code>counters</code> object to its
``ordinary'' representation:

<pre>
(defun show-counters (counters)
  (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
  (list (NodeCnt counters)
        (TipCnt counters)
        (IntTipsSeen counters)))
</pre>

Observe that we <em>must</em> declare, at the top of the <code>defun</code>, that
we mean to use the formal parameter <code>counters</code> as a single-threaded
object!  If we did not make this declaration, the body of
<code>show-counters</code> would be processed as though <code>counters</code> were an
ordinary object.  An error would be caused because the accessors
used above cannot be applied to anything but the single-threaded
object <code>counters</code>.  If you want to know why we insist on this
declaration, see <a href="DECLARE-STOBJS.html">declare-stobjs</a>.<p>

When <code>show-counters</code> is admitted, the following message is printed:

<pre>
Since SHOW-COUNTERS is non-recursive, its admission is trivial.  We
observe that the type of SHOW-COUNTERS is described by the theorem
(AND (CONSP (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS))
     (TRUE-LISTP (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS))).
We used primitive type reasoning.<p>

(SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS) =&gt; *.<p>

The guard conjecture for SHOW-COUNTERS is trivial to prove.  
SHOW-COUNTERS is compliant with Common Lisp.
</pre>

The line above containing the ``=&gt;'' is called the ``signature'' of
<code>show-counters</code>; it conveys the information that the first argument
is the single-threaded object <code>counters</code> and the only result is an
ordinary object.  Here is an example of another signature:

<pre>
(PROCESSOR * * COUNTERS) =&gt; (MV * COUNTERS)
</pre>

which indicates that the function <code>PROCESSOR</code> (which we haven't
shown you) takes three arguments, the third of which is the 
<code>COUNTERS</code> stobj, and returns two results, the second of which
is the modified <code>COUNTERS</code>.<p>

Returning to the admission of <code>show-counters</code> above, the last
sentence printed indicates that the <code><a href="GUARD.html">guard</a></code> conjectures for the
function were proved.  When some argument of a function is declared
to be a single-threaded object via the <code>xargs</code> <code>:stobj</code>, we
automatically add (conjoin) to the guard the condition that the
argument satisfy the recognizer for that single-threaded object.  In
the case of <code>show-counters</code> the guard is <code>(countersp counters)</code>.<p>

Here is an example of <code>show-counters</code> being called:

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(3 0 NIL)
</pre>

This is what we would see had we set the <code>NodeCnt</code> field of the
initial value of <code>counters</code> to <code>3</code>, as we did earlier in this
example.<p>

We next wish to define a function to reset the <code>counters</code> object.
We could define it this way:

<pre>
(defun reset-counters (counters)
  (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
  (let ((counters (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)))
    (let ((counters (update-TipCnt 0 counters)))
      (update-IntTipsSeen nil counters))))
</pre>

which ``successively'' sets the <code>NodeCnt</code> field to <code>0</code>, then the
<code>TipCnt</code> field to <code>0</code>, and then the <code>IntTipsSeen</code> field to <code>nil</code> and
returns the resulting object.<p>

However, the nest of <code>let</code> expressions is tedious and we use this
definition instead.  This definition exploits a macro, here named
``<code>seq</code>'' (for ``sequentially'') which evaluates each of the forms
given, binding their results successively to the stobj name given.  

<pre>
(defun reset-counters (counters)
  (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
  (seq counters
       (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)
       (update-TipCnt 0 counters)
       (update-IntTipsSeen nil counters)))
</pre>

This definition is syntactically identical to the one above, after macro
expansion.  Our definition of <code>seq</code> is shown below and is not part of
native ACL2.

<pre>
(defmacro seq (stobj &amp;rest rst)
  (cond ((endp rst) stobj)
        ((endp (cdr rst)) (car rst))
        (t `(let ((,stobj ,(car rst)))
             (seq ,stobj ,@(cdr rst))))))
</pre>
<p>

The signature printed for <code>reset-counters</code> is

<pre>
(RESET-COUNTERS COUNTERS) =&gt; COUNTERS.
</pre>
<p>

Here is an example.

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(3 0 NIL)
ACL2 !&gt;(reset-counters counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(0 0 NIL) 
</pre>
<p>

Here finally is a function that uses <code>counters</code> as a single-threaded
accumulator to collect the desired information about the tree <code>x</code>.

<pre>
(defun sweep-tree (x counters)
  (declare (xargs :stobjs (counters)))
  (cond ((atom x)
         (seq counters
              (update-TipCnt (+ 1 (TipCnt counters)) counters)
              (if (integerp x)
                  (update-IntTipsSeen (cons x (IntTipsSeen counters))
                                  counters)
                counters)))
        (t (seq counters
                (update-NodeCnt (+ 1 (NodeCnt counters)) counters)
                (sweep-tree (car x) counters)
                (sweep-tree (cdr x) counters)))))
</pre>

We can paraphrase this definition as follows.  If <code>x</code> is an atom,
then increment the <code>TipCnt</code> field of <code>counters</code> and <em>then</em>,
if <code>x</code> is an integer, add <code>x</code> to the <code>IntTipsSeen</code> field, and
return <code>counters</code>.  On the other hand, if <code>x</code> is not
an atom, then increment the <code>NodeCnt</code> field of <code>counters</code>, and
<em>then</em> sweep the <code>car</code> of <code>x</code> and <em>then</em> sweep the <code>cdr</code>
of <code>x</code> and return the result.<p>

Here is an example of its execution.  We have displayed the input tree
in full dot notation so that the number of interior nodes is just the
number of dots.

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(sweep-tree '((((a . 1) . (2 . b)) . 3)
                     . (4 . (5 . d)))
                   counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(7 8 (5 4 3 2 1))
ACL2 !&gt;(reset-counters counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(0 0 NIL)
</pre>
<p>

The <code>counters</code> object has two integer fields and a field whose
type is unrestricted.  single-threaded objects support other types of
fields, such as arrays.  We deal with that in the <a href="STOBJ-EXAMPLE-2.html">stobj-example-2</a>.
But we recommend that you first consider the implementation issues for
the <code>counters</code> example (in <a href="STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.html">stobj-example-1-implementation</a>) and
then consider the proof issues (in <a href="STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1-PROOFS.html">stobj-example-1-proofs</a>).<p>
