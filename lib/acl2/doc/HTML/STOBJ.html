<h1>STOBJ</h1>single-threaded objects or ``von Neumann bottlenecks''

</pre><p>

In ACL2, a ``single-threaded object'' is a data structure whose use
is so syntactically restricted that only one instance of the object
need ever exist and its fields can be updated by destructive
assignments.<p>

The documentation in this section is laid out in the form of a tour
that visits the documented topics in a reasonable order.  We
recommend that you follow the tour the first time you read about
stobjs.  The list of all stobj topics is shown below.  The tour
starts immediately afterwards.

As noted, a ``single-threaded object'' is a data structure whose use
is so syntactically restricted that only one instance of the object
need ever exist.  Updates to the object must be sequentialized.
This allows us to update its fields with destructive assignments
without wrecking the axiomatic semantics of update-by-copy.  For
this reason, single-threaded objects are sometimes called ``von
Neumann bottlenecks.''<p>

From the logical perspective, a single-threaded object is an
ordinary ACL2 object, e.g., composed of integers and conses.
Logically speaking, ordinary ACL2 functions are defined to allow the
user to ``access'' and ``update'' its fields.  Logically speaking,
when fields in the object, obj, are ``updated'' with new values, a
new object, obj', is constructed.<p>

But suppose that by syntactic means we could ensure that there were
no more references to the ``old'' object, obj.  Then we could
create obj' by destructively modifying the memory locations
involved in the representation of obj.  The syntactic means is
pretty simple but draconian: the only reference to obj is in
the variable named <code>OBJ</code>.<p>

The consequences of this simple rule are far-reaching and require
some getting used to.  For example, if <code>OBJ</code> has been declared as a
single-threaded object name, then:<p>

* <code>OBJ</code> is a top-level global variable that contains the current
  object, obj.<p>

* If a function uses the formal parameter <code>OBJ</code>, the only 
  ``actual expression'' that can be passed into that slot is the variable
  <code>OBJ</code>, not merely a term that ``evaluates to an obj'';
  thus, such functions can only operate on the current object.  So for
  example, instead of <code>(FOO (UPDATE-FIELD1 3 ST))</code> write
  <code>(LET ((ST (UPDATE-FIELD1 3 ST))) (FOO ST))</code>.<p>

* The accessors and updaters have a formal parameter named <code>OBJ</code>,
  thus, those functions can only be applied to the current object.<p>

* The ACL2 primitives, such as <code>CONS</code>, <code>CAR</code> and <code>CDR</code>, may not
  be applied to the variable <code>OBJ</code>.  Thus, for example, obj may not
  be consed into a list (which would create another pointer to it) or
  accessed or copied via ``unapproved'' means.<p>

* The updaters return a ``new <code>OBJ</code> object'', i.e., obj'; thus, when
  an updater is called, the only variable which can hold its result is
  <code>OBJ</code>.<p>

* If a function calls an <code>OBJ</code> updater, it must return an <code>OBJ</code> object
  (either as the sole value returned, or in <code>(mv ... OBJ ...)</code>; see <a href="MV.html">mv</a>).<p>

* When a top-level expression involving <code>OBJ</code> returns an <code>OBJ</code>
  object, that object becomes the new current value of <code>OBJ</code>.<p>

What makes ACL2 different from other functional languages supporting
such operations (e.g., Haskell's ``monads'' and Clean's ``uniqueness
type system'') is that ACL2 also gives single-threaded objects an
explicit axiomatic semantics so that theorems can be proved about
them.  In particular, the syntactic restrictions noted above are
enforced only when single-threaded objects are used in function
definitions (which might be executed outside of the ACL2
read-eval-print loop in Common Lisp).  The accessor and update
functions for single-threaded objects may be used without
restriction in formulas to be proved.  Since function evaluation is
sometimes necessary during proofs, ACL2 must be able to evaluate
these functions on logical constants representing the object, even
when the constant is not ``the current object.''  Thus, ACL2
supports both the efficient von Neumann semantics and the clean
applicative semantics, and uses the first in contexts where
execution speed is paramount and the second during proofs.<p>
