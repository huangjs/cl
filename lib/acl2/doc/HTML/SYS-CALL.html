<h2>SYS-CALL</h2>make a system call to the host operating system
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PROGRAMMING.html">PROGRAMMING</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example Forms:
(sys-call "cp" '("foo.lisp" "foo-copied.lisp"))
(prog2$ (sys-call "cp" '("foo.lisp" "foo-copied.lisp"))
        (sys-call-status state))
</pre>

The first argument of <code>sys-call</code> is a command for the host operating
system, and the second argument is a list of strings that are the
arguments for that command.  In GCL and perhaps other lisps, you can put the
arguments with the command; but this is not the case, for example, in Allegro
CL running on Linux.<p>

The use of <code><a href="PROG2$.html">prog2$</a></code> above is optional, but illustrates a typical sort
of use when one wishes to get the return status.  See <a href="SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a>.
<p>

<pre>
General Form:
(sys-call cmd args)
</pre>

This function logically returns <code>nil</code>.  However, it makes the
indicated call to the host operating system, as described above,
using a function supplied ``under the hood'' by the underlying Lisp
system.  On occasions where one wishes to obtain the numeric status
returned by the host operating system (or more precisely, by the
Lisp function under the hood that passes the system call to the host
operating system), one may do so;  see <a href="SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a>.  The
status value is the value returned by that Lisp function, which may
well be the same numeric value returned by the host operating system
for the underlying system call.<p>

Note that <code>sys-call</code> does not touch the ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>; however,
<code><a href="SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a></code> updates the <code>file-clock</code> field of the <code>state</code>.  One may
view that update as modifying the <code>fileclock</code> to be at least as
recent as the time of the most recent <code>sys-call</code>.<p>

Be careful if you use <code>sys-call</code>!  It can be used for example to overwrite
files, or worse!  The following example from Bob Boyer shows how to use
<code>sys-call</code> to execute, in effect, arbitrary Lisp forms.  ACL2 provides a
``trust tag'' mechanism that requires execution of a <code><a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></code> form
before you can use <code>sys-call</code>; see <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>.  (Note: The setting of the raw
Lisp variable <code>*features*</code> below is just to illustrate that any such
mischief is possible.  Normally <code>*features*</code> is a list with more than a few
elements.)

<pre>
% cat foo
print *0x85d2064=0x838E920
detach
q
% acl2
... boilerplate deleted
ACL2 !&gt;(sys-call "gdb -p $PPID -w &lt; foo &gt;&amp; /dev/null " nil)
NIL
ACL2 !&gt;:q<p>

Exiting the ACL2 read-eval-print loop.  To re-enter, execute (LP).
ACL2&gt;*features*<p>

Finally, we make a comment about output redirection, which also applies to
other related features that one may expect of a shell.  <code>Sys-call</code> does not
directly support output redirection.  If you want to run a program, <code>P</code>,
and redirect its output, we suggest that you create a wrapper script, <code>W</code>
to call instead.  Thus <code>W</code> might be a shell script containing the line:

<pre>
P $* &gt;&amp; foo.out
</pre>

If this sort of solution proves inadequate, please contact the ACL2
implementors and perhaps we can come up with a solution.
