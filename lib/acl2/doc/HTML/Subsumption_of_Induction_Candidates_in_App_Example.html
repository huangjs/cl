<h2>Subsumption of Induction Candidates in App Example</h2>
<p>
After collecting induction suggestions from these three terms

<pre>
(app <b>a</B> b)<p>

(app <b>b</B> c)<p>

(app <b>a</B> (app b c))
</pre>

the system notices that the first and last suggest the same decomposition
of <code>a</code>.  So we are left with two ideas about how to induct:<p>

Decompose <b>a</B> as we would to unwind (app <b>a</B> b).<p>

Decompose <b>b</B> as we would to unwind (app <b>b</B> c).
