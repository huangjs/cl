<h2>Suggested Inductions in the Associativity of App Example</h2>
<p>
To find a plausible induction argument, the
system studies the recursions exhibited by the terms in the conjecture.<p>

Roughly speaking, a call of a recursive function ``suggests'' an
induction if the argument position decomposed in recursion is occupied
by a variable.<p>

In this conjecture, three terms suggest inductions:<p>


<pre>
(app <b>a</B> b)<p>

(app <b>b</B> c)<p>

(app <b>a</B> (app b c))
</pre>

The variable recursively decomposed is indicated in <b>bold</B>.
