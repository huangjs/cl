(table tests nil '((foo . 7)) :clear) ; set table tests to (foo 7)
(table tests nil nil :guard)          ; fetch the table guard
(table tests nil nil :guard term)     ; set the table guard
<p>
General Form:
(table table-name key-term value-term op term)
</pre>

where <code>table-name</code> is a symbol that is the name of a (possibly new)
table, <code>key-term</code> and <code>value-term</code>, if present, are arbitrary terms
involving (at most) the single variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>, <code>op</code>, if present, is
one of the table operations below, and <code>term</code>, if present, is a term.
<code>Table</code> returns an acl2 ``error triple.'' The effect of <code>table</code> on <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>
depends on <code>op</code> and how many arguments are presented.  Some
invocations actually have no effect on the ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> and hence an
invocation of <code>table</code> is not always an ``event''.  We explain below,
after giving some background information.<p>

<b>Important Note:</B>  The <code>table</code> forms above are calls of a macro
that expand to involve the special variable <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  This will
prevent you from accessing a table from within a hint or theory where
where you do not have the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> variable.  However, the form

<pre>
(table-alist 'tests world)
</pre>

returns the alist representation of the table named <code>test</code> in the
given world.  Often you have access to <code>world</code>.<p>

The ACL2 system provides ``tables'' by which the user can associate
one object with another.  Tables are in essence just conventional
association lists -- lists of pairs -- but the ACL2 environment
provides a means of storing these lists in the ``ACL2 world'' of the
current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  The ACL2 user could accomplish the same ends by
using ACL2 ``global variables;'' however, limitations on global
variable names are imposed to ensure ACL2's soundness.  By
convention, no table is important to ACL2's soundness, even though
some features of the system use tables, and the user is invited to
make free use of tables.  Because tables are stored in the ACL2
<a href="WORLD.html">world</a> they are restored by <code><a href="INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></code> and undone by <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT.html">ubt</a></code>.  Many
users of Nqthm requested a facility by which user data could be
saved in Nqthm ``lib files'' and tables are ACL2's answer to that
request.<p>

Abstractly, each table is an association list mapping ``keys'' to
``values.'' In addition, each table has a ``<code>:guard</code>,'' which is a
term that must be true of any key and value used.  By setting the
<code>:guard</code> on a table you may enforce an invariant on the objects in the
table, e.g., that all keys are positive integers and all values are
symbols.  Each table has a ``name,'' which must be a symbol.  Given
a table name, there are six operations one might perform on the
table.<p>

<code>:put</code> -- associate a value with a key (possibly changing the value
currently associated with that key).<p>

<code>:get</code> -- retrieve the value associated with a key (or nil if no
value has been associated with that key).<p>

<code>:alist</code> -- return an alist showing all keys and non-nil values in
the table.<p>

<code>:clear</code> -- clear the table (so that every value is nil), or if val
is supplied then set table to that value (which must be an alist).<p>

<code>:guard</code> -- fetch or set the :guard of the table.<p>

When the operations above suggest that the table or its <code>:guard</code> are
modified, what is actually meant is that the current <a href="STATE.html">state</a> is redefined
so that in it, the affected table name has the appropriate properties.  in
such cases, the <code>table</code> form is an event (see <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>).  In the <code>:put</code>
case, if the key is already in the table and associated with the proposed
value, then the <code>table</code> event is redundant (see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>).<p>

<code>Table</code> forms are commonly typed by the user while interacting with
the system.  <code>:Put</code> and <code>:get</code> forms are especially common.  Therefore,
we have adopted a positional syntax that is intended to be
convenient for most applications.  Essentially, some operations
admit a ``short form'' of invocation.

<pre>
(table name key-term value-term :put)   ; long form
(table name key-term value-term)        ; short form
</pre>

evaluates the key- and value-terms, obtaining two objects that we
call <code>key</code> and <code>value</code>, checks that the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> satisfy the
<code>:guard</code> on the named table and then ``modifies'' the named table
so that the value associated with <code>key</code> is <code>value</code>.  When used like
this, <code>table</code> is actually an event in the sense that it changes the
ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  In general, the forms evaluated to obtain the <code>key</code> and
<code>value</code> may involve the variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>, which is bound to the
then-current <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> during the evaluation of the forms.  However, in
the special case that the table in question is named
<code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code>, the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> terms may not contain any
variables.  Essentially, the keys and values used in <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> setting
the <code><a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a></code> must be explicitly given constants.
See <a href="ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">acl2-defaults-table</a>.

<pre>
(table name key-term nil :get)          ; long form
(table name key-term)                   ; short form
</pre>

evaluates the key-term (see note below), obtaining an object, <code>key</code>,
and returns the value associated with <code>key</code> in the named table (or,
<code>nil</code> if there is no value associated with <code>key</code>).  When used like this,
<code>table</code> is not an event; the value is simply returned.

<pre>
(table name nil nil :alist)             ; long form
(table name)                            ; short form
</pre>

returns an alist representing the named table; for every key in
the table with a non-<code>nil</code> associated value, the alist pairs the key
and its value.  The order in which the keys are presented is
unspecified.  When used like this, <code>table</code> is not an event; the alist
is simply returned.

<pre>
(table name nil val :clear)
</pre>

sets the named table to the alist <code>val</code>, making the checks that <code>:put</code>
makes for each key and value of <code>val</code>.  When used like this, <code>table</code> is
an event because it changes the ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.

<pre>
(table name nil nil :guard)
</pre>

returns the translated form of the guard of the named table.

<pre>
(table name nil nil :guard term)
</pre>

Provided the named table is empty and has not yet been assigned a
<code>:guard</code> and <code>term</code> (which is not evaluated) is a term that mentions at
most the variables <code>key</code>, <code>val</code> and <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>, this event sets the <code>:guard</code> of
the named table to <code>term</code>.  Whenever a subsequent <code>:put</code> occurs, <code>term</code>
will be evaluated with <code>key</code> bound to the key argument of the <code>:put</code>,
<code>val</code> bound to the <code>val</code> argument of the <code>:put</code>, and <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> bound to the
then current <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>.  An error will be caused by the <code>:put</code> if the
result of the evaluation is <code>nil</code>.<p>

Note that it is not allowed to change the <code>:guard</code> on a table once it
has been explicitly set.  Before the <code>:guard</code> is explicitly set, it is
effectively just <code>t</code>.  After it is set it can be changed only by
undoing the event that set it.  The purpose of this restriction is
to prevent the user from changing the <code>:guards</code> on tables provided by
other people or the system.<p>

The intuition behind the <code>:guard</code> mechanism on tables is to enforce
invariants on the keys and values in a table, so that the values,
say, can be used without run-time checking.  But if the <code>:guard</code> of a
table is sensitive to the ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, it may be possible to cause
some value in the table to cease satisfying the <code>:guard</code> without doing
any operations on the table.  Consider for example the <code>:guard</code> ``no
value in this table is the name of an event.'' As described, that is
enforced each time a value is stored.  Thus, <code>'bang</code> can be <code>:put</code> in
the table provided there is no event named <code>bang</code>.  But once it is in
the table, there is nothing to prevent the user from defining <code>bang</code>
as a function, causing the table to contain a value that could not
be <code>:put</code> there anymore.  Observe that not all state-sensitive <code>:guard</code>s
suffer this problem.  The <code>:guard</code> ``every value is an event name''
remains invariant, courtesy of the fact that undoing back through an
event name in the table would necessarily undo the <code>:put</code> of the name
into the table.<p>

<code>Table</code> was designed primarily for convenient top-level use.  Tables
are not especially efficient.  Each table is represented by an alist
stored on the property list of the table name.  <code>:Get</code> is just a
<code>getprop</code> and <code><a href="ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a></code>.  <code>:Put</code> does a <code>getprop</code> to the get the table
alist, a <code>put-assoc-equal</code> to record the new association, and a
<code>putprop</code> to store the new table alist -- plus the overhead associated
with <code>:guard</code>s and undoable <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>, and checking (for redundancy) if
the key is already bound to its proposed value.  Note that there are never
duplicate keys in the resulting <code>alist</code>; in particular, when the
operation <code>:clear</code> is used to install new <code>alist</code>, duplicate keys are
removed from that alist.<p>

A table name may be any symbol whatsoever.  Symbols already in use
as function or theorem names, for example, may be used as table
names.  Symbols in use only as table names may be defined with
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>, etc.  Because there are no restrictions on the user's choice
of table names, table names are not included among the logical
names.  Thus, <code>:pe name</code> will never display a table event (for a
logical name other than <code>:here</code>).  Either <code>:pe name</code> will display a
``normal'' event such as <code>(defun name ...)</code> or <code>(defthm name ...)</code> or
else <code>:pe name</code> will cause an error indicating that <code>name</code> is not a
logical name.  This happens even if <code>name</code> is in use as a table name.
Similarly, we do not permit table names to have <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
strings, since the same name might already have a <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>
string.  If you want to associate a <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> string with a
table name that is being used no other way, define the name as a
label and use the <code>:</code><code><a href="DOC.html">doc</a></code> feature of <code><a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></code>
(see <a href="DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a>); also see <a href="DEFDOC.html">defdoc</a>.
