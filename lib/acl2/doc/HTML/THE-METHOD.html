<h2>THE-METHOD</h2>how to find proofs

Many users develop proof scripts in an Emacs buffer and submit one
event at a time to the theorem prover running in a <code>*shell*</code> buffer.
The script buffer is logically divided into two regions: the events
that have been accepted by the theorem prover and those that have
not yet been accepted.  An imaginary ``barrier'' divides these two
regions.  The region above the barrier describes the state of the
<code>*shell*</code> buffer (and ACL2's logical world).  The region below the
barrier is the ``to do'' list.<p>

We usually start a proof project by typing the key lemmas, and main
goal into the to do list.  Definitions are here just regarded as
theorems to prove (i.e., the measure conjectures).  Then we follow
``The Method.''<p>

(1) Think about the proof of the first theorem in the to do list.
Structure the proof either as an induction followed by
simplification or just simplification.  Have the necessary lemmas
been proved? That is, are the necessary lemmas in the done list
already?  If so, proceed to Step 2.  Otherwise, add the necessary
lemmas at the front of the to do list and repeat Step 1.<p>

(2) Call the theorem prover on the first theorem in the to do list
and let the output stream into the *shell* buffer.  Abort the proof
if it runs more than a few seconds.<p>

(3) If the theorem prover succeeded, advance the barrier past the
successful command and go to Step 1.<p>

(4) Otherwise, inspect the failed proof attempt, starting from the
beginning, not the end.  Basically you should look for the first
place the proof attempt deviates from your imagined proof.  If your
imagined proof was inductive, inspect the induction scheme used by
ACL2.  If that is ok, then find the first subsequent subgoal that is
stable under simplification and think about why it was not proved by
the simplifier.  If your imagined proof was not inductive, then
think about the first subgoal stable under simplification, as above.
Modify the script appropriately.  It usually means adding lemmas to
the to do list, just in front of the theorem just tried.  It could
mean adding hints to the current theorem.  In any case, after the
modifications go to Step 1.
<p>
We do not seriously suggest that this or any rotely applied
algorithm will let you drive ACL2 to difficult proofs.  Indeed, to
remind you of this we call this ``The Method'' rather than ``the
method.''  That is, we are aware of the somewhat pretentious nature
of any such advice.  But these remarks have helped many users
approach ACL2 in a constructive and disciplined way.<p>

We say much more about The Method in the ACL2 book.  See the
home page.<p>

Learning to read failed proofs is a useful skill.  There are several
kinds of ``checkpoints'' in a proof: (1) a formula to which induction
is being (or would be) applied, (2) the first formula stable under
simplification, (3) a formula that is possibly generalized, either
by cross-fertilizing with and throwing away an equivalence hypothesis
or by explicit generalization of a term with a new variable.  <p>

At the induction checkpoint, confirm that you believe the formula
being proved is a theorem and that it is appropriately strong for an
inductive proof.  Read the selected induction scheme and make sure it
agrees with your idea of how the proof should go.<p>

At the post-simplification checkpoint, which is probably the most
commonly seen, consider whether there are additional rewrite rules
you could prove to make the formula simplify still further.  Look
for compositions of function symbols you could rewrite.  Look for
contradictions among hypotheses and prove the appropriate
implications: for example, the checkpoint might contain the two
hypotheses <code>(P (F A))</code> and <code>(NOT (Q (G (F A))))</code> and you might
realize that <code>(implies (p x) (q (g x)))</code> is a theorem.  Look for
signs that your existing rules did not apply, e.g., for terms that
should have been rewritten, and figure out why they were not.
Possible causes include that they do not exactly match your old
rules, that your old rules have hypotheses that cannot be relieved
here -- perhaps because some other rules are missing, or perhaps
your old rules are disabled.  If you cannot find any further
simplifications to make in the formula, ask yourself whether it is
valid.  If so, sketch a proof.  Perhaps the proof is by appeal to a
combination of lemmas you should now prove?  <p>

At the two generalization checkpoints --- where hypotheses are
discarded or terms are replaced by variables --- ask yourself whether
the result is a theorem.  It often is not.  Think about rewrite rules
that would prove the formula.  These are often restricted versions of the
overly-general formulas created by the system's heuristics.<p>
