A theory is a list of ``runic designators'' as described below.
Each runic designator denotes a set of ``runes'' (see <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>) and
by unioning together the runes denoted by each member of a theory we
define the set of runes corresponding to a theory.  Theories are
used to control which rules are ``<a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d,'' i.e., available for
automatic application by the theorem prover.  There is always a
``current'' theory.  A rule is <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d precisely if its <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> is an
element of the set of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s corresponding to the current theory.  At
the top-level, the current theory is the theory selected by the most
recent <code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code> event, extended with the rule names introduced
since then.  Inside the theorem prover, the <code>:</code><code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code> hint
(see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>) can be used to select a particular theory as
current during the proof attempt for a particular goal.<p>

Theories are generally constructed by ``theory expressions.''
Formally, a theory expression is any term, containing at most the
single free variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>, that when evaluated with <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> bound to
the current ACL2 world (see <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>) produces a theory.  ACL2
provides various functions for the convenient construction and
manipulation of theories.  These are called ``theory functions''
(see <a href="THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a>).  For example, the theory function
<code><a href="UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></code> takes two theories and produces their union.  The
theory function <code><a href="UNIVERSAL-THEORY.html">universal-theory</a></code> returns the theory containing all
known rule names as of the introduction of a given logical name.
But a theory expression can contain constants, e.g.,

<pre>
'(assoc (assoc) (:rewrite car-cons) car-cdr-elim)
</pre>

and user-defined functions.  The only important criterion is that a
theory expression mention no variable freely except <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> and
evaluate to a theory.<p>

More often than not, theory expressions typed by the user do not
mention the variable <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>.  This is because user-typed theory
expressions are generally composed of applications of ACL2's theory
functions.  These ``functions'' are actually macros that expand into
terms in which <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> is used freely and appropriately.  Thus, the
technical definition of ``theory expression'' should not mislead you
into thinking that interestng theory expressions must mention <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code>;
they probably do and you just didn't know it!<p>

One aspect of this arrangement is that theory expressions cannot
generally be evaluated at the top-level of ACL2, because <code><a href="WORLD.html">world</a></code> is
not bound.  To see the value of a theory expression, <code>expr</code>, at the
top-level, type

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(LET ((WORLD (W STATE))) expr).
</pre>

However, because the built-in theories are quite long, you may be
sorry you printed the value of a theory expression!<p>

A theory is a true list of runic designators and to each theory
there corresponds a set of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s, obtained by unioning together the
sets of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s denoted by each runic designator.  For example, the
theory constant

<pre>
   '(assoc (assoc) (:rewrite car-cons) car-cdr-elim)
</pre>

corresponds to the set of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s

<pre>
   {(:definition assoc)
    (:induction assoc)
    (:executable-counterpart assoc)
    (:elim car-cdr-elim)
    (:rewrite car-cons)} .
</pre>

Observe that the theory contains four elements but its runic
correspondent contains five.  That is because some designators
denote sets of several <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s.  If the above theory were selected as
current then the five rules named in its runic counterpart would be
<a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d and all other rules would be <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.<p>

We now precisely define the runic designators and the set of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s
denoted by each.
<blockquote><p>

o A rune is a runic designator and denotes the singleton set
containing that rune.<p>

o If <code>symb</code> is a function symbol introduced with a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> (or <code><a href="DEFUNS.html">defuns</a></code>)
event, then <code>symb</code> is a runic designator and denotes the set containing
the runes <code>(:definition symb)</code> and <code>(:induction symb)</code>, omitting the
latter if no such <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> rule exists (presumably because the function's
definition is not singly recursive).<p>

o If <code>symb</code> is a function symbol introduced with a <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> (or <code><a href="DEFUNS.html">defuns</a></code>)
event, then <code>(symb)</code> is a runic designator and denotes the singleton
set containing the rune <code>(:executable-counterpart symb)</code>.<p>

o If <code>symb</code> is the name of a <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code> (or <code><a href="DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></code>) event that
introduced at least one rule, then <code>symb</code> is a runic designator and
denotes the set of the names of all rules introduced by the named
event.<p>

o If <code>str</code> is the string naming some <code><a href="DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></code> event and <code>symb</code> is the
symbol returned by <code>(intern str "ACL2")</code>, then <code>symb</code> is a runic
designator and denotes the singleton set containing <code>(:rewrite symb)</code>,
which is the name of the rule stating the conditions under which the
<code><a href="SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></code> of <code>(intern x str)</code> is <code>str</code>.<p>

o If <code>symb</code> is the name of a <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code> event, then <code>symb</code> is a runic
designator and denotes the runic theory corresponding to <code>symb</code>.<p>

</blockquote>
These conventions attempt to implement the Nqthm-1992 treatment of
theories.  For example, including a function name, e.g., <code><a href="ASSOC.html">assoc</a></code>, in
the current theory <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>s that function but does not <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a> the
executable counterpart.  Similarly, including <code>(assoc)</code> <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>s the
executable counterpart (Nqthm's <code>*1*assoc</code>) but not the symbolic
definition.  And including the name of a proved lemma <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>s all of
the rules added by the event.  These conventions are entirely
consistent with Nqthm usage.  Of course, in ACL2 one can include
explicitly the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s naming the rules in question and so can avoid
entirely the use of non-runic elements in theories.<p>

Because a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> is a runic designator denoting the set containing
that <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>, a list of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s is a theory and denotes itself.  We call
such theories ``runic theories.''  To every theory there corresponds
a runic theory obtained by unioning together the sets denoted by
each designator in the theory.  When a theory is selected as
``current'' it is actually its runic correspondent that is
effectively used.  That is, a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> is <a href="ENABLE.html">enable</a>d iff it is a member of
the runic correspondent of the current theory.  The value of a
theory defined with <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code> is the runic correspondent of the
theory computed by the defining theory expression.  The theory
manipulation functions, e.g., <code><a href="UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></code>, actually convert their
theory arguments to their runic correspondents before performing the
required set operation.  The manipulation functions always return
runic theories.  Thus, it is sometimes convenient to think of
(non-runic) theories as merely abbreviations for their runic
correspondents, abbreviations which are ``expanded'' at the first
opportunity by theory manipulation functions and the ``theory
consumer'' functions such as <code><a href="IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></code>.
