<h2>TIDBITS</h2>some basic hints for using ACL2
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="ACL2-TUTORIAL.html">ACL2-TUTORIAL</a>
</pre><p>
<p>
See <a href="BOOKS.html">books</a> for a discussion of books.  Briefly, a book is a file
whose name ends in ``.lisp'' that contains ACL2 <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>;
see <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.<p>

See <a href="HISTORY.html">history</a> for a list of useful commands.  Some examples:

<pre><p>

  :pbt :here      ; print the current event
  :pbt (:here -3) ; print the last four events
  :u              ; undo the last event
  :pe append      ; print the definition of append<p>

</pre>

See <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> to learn how to print documentation to the
terminal.  There are also versions of the <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for Mosaic,
Emacs Info, and hardcopy.<p>

There are quite a few kinds of rules allowed in ACL2 besides
<code>:</code><code><a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></code> rules, though we hope that beginners won't usually need
to be aware of them.  See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for details.  In
particular, there is support for <a href="CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rewriting.
See <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> (``RUle NamE'') for a description of the various kinds
of rules in the system.  Also see <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> for a description of
how to build <a href="THEORIES.html">theories</a> of <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s, which are often used in hints;
see <a href="HINTS.html">hints</a>.<p>

A ``<a href="PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> mode'' is supported; see <a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a>,
see <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>, and see <a href="DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>.  It can be
useful to prototype functions after executing the command <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>,
which will cause definitions to be syntaxed-checked only.<p>

ACL2 supports mutual recursion, though this feature is not tied into
the automatic discovery of <a href="INDUCTION.html">induction</a> schemas and is often not the
best way to proceed when you expect to be reasoning about the
functions.  See <a href="DEFUNS.html">defuns</a>; also see <a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a>.<p>

See <a href="LD.html">ld</a> for discussion of how to load files of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  There
are many options to <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>, including ones to suppress proofs and to
control output.<p>

The <code>:</code><code><a href="OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></code> (Onward Thru the Fog FLaG) is a useful feature that
Nqthm users have often wished for.  It prevents the prover from
aborting a proof attempt and inducting on the original conjecture.
See <a href="OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a>.<p>

ACL2 supports redefinition and redundancy in <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>;
see <a href="LD-REDEFINITION-ACTION.html">ld-redefinition-action</a> and see <a href="REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>.<p>

A <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> display feature is available for use with Emacs.  This
feature provides a view of ACL2 proofs that can be much more useful
than reading the stream of <a href="CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> output by the theorem prover
as its ``proof.''  See <a href="PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.<p>

An interactive feature similar to Pc-Nqthm is supported in ACL2.
See <a href="VERIFY.html">verify</a> and see <a href="PROOF-CHECKER.html">proof-checker</a>.<p>

ACL2 allows you to <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the use of <a href="REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules.
See <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>.<p>

See <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> to read about applicative, fast <a href="ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> in ACL2.<p>

To quit the ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop, or (in akcl) to return to the ACL2
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop after an interrupt, type <code>:</code><code><a href="Q.html">q</a></code>.  To continue (resume)
after an interrupt (in akcl), type <code>:r</code>.  To cause an interrupt (in
akcl under Unix (trademark of AT&amp;T)), hit control-C (twice, if
inside Emacs).  To exit ACL2 altogether, first type <code>:</code><code><a href="Q.html">q</a></code> to exit
the ACL2 <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> loop, and then exit Lisp (by typing
<code>(user::bye)</code> in akcl).<p>

See <a href="STATE.html">state</a> to read about the von Neumannesque ACL2 <a href="STATE.html">state</a> object that
records the ``current state'' of the ACL2 session.
Also see <a href="_at_.html">@</a>, and see <a href="ASSIGN.html">assign</a>, to learn about reading and
setting global <a href="STATE.html">state</a> variables.<p>

If you want your own von Neumannesque object, e.g., a structure that
can be ``destructively modified'' but which must be used with some
syntactic restrictions, see <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.
