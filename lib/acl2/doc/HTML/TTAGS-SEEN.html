<h2>TTAGS-SEEN</h2>list some declared trust tags (ttags)
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
General Forms:
:ttags-seen
(ttags-seen)
</pre>

Suppose the output is as follows.

<pre>
(T NIL)
(FOO "/home/bob/bar.lisp"
     "/home/cindy/bar.lisp")
Warning: This output is minimally trustworthy (see :DOC TTAGS-SEEN).
</pre>

This output indicates that the current logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> has seen the
declaration of trust tag <code>T</code> at the top-level (see <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) and the
declaration of trust tag <code>FOO</code> in the two books included from the listed
locations.  The warning emphasizes that this command cannot be used to
validate the ``purity'' of an ACL2 session, because using a ttag renders
enough power to hide from this or any other command the fact that the ttag
was ever declared.
<p>
As discussed elsewhere (see <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>), the only reliable way to validate
the ``purity'' of a session is to watch for ``<code>TTAG NOTE</code>'' output.<p>

Another shortcoming of this command is that it only checks the current
logical <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> for ttag declarations.  For example, one could execute a
<code><a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></code> event; then use <code><a href="PROGN_bang_.html">progn!</a></code> and <code><a href="SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></code> to replace
system functions with corrupt definitions or to introduce inconsistent axioms
in the <code><a href="GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></code> <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>; and finally, execute <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT_bang_.html">1</a></code>
to remove all evidence of the ttag in the <a href="WORLD.html">world</a> while leaving in place
the corrupt definitions or axioms.  The base world is now tainted, meaning we
could prove <code>nil</code> or certify a book that proves <code>nil</code>, but the resulting
session or book would contain no trace of the ttag that tainted it!<p>

Despite shortcomings, this command might be useful to system hackers.  It
also serves to illustrate the inherent flaw in asking a session whether or
how it is ``tainted'', justifying the ``<code>TTAG NOTE</code>'' approach
(see <a href="DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).
