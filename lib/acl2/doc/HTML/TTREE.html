Many low-level ACL2 functions take and return ``tag trees'' or
``ttrees'' (pronounced ``tee-trees'') which contain various useful
bits of information such as the lemmas used, the linearize
assumptions made, etc.
<p>
Let a ``tagged pair'' be a list whose car is a symbol, called the
``tag,'' and whose cdr is an arbitrary object, called the ``tagged
object.''  A ``tag tree'' is either nil, a tagged pair consed onto a
tag tree, or a non-nil tag tree consed onto a tag tree.<p>

Abstractly a tag tree represents a list of sets, each member set
having a name given by one of the tags occurring in the ttree.  The
elements of the set named <code>tag</code> are all of the objects tagged
<code>tag</code> in the tree.  To cons a tagged pair <code>(tag . obj)</code> onto a
tree is to <code>add-to-set-equal</code> <code>obj</code> to the set corresponding to
<code>tag</code>.  To <code>cons</code> two tag trees together is to union-equal the
corresponding sets.  The concrete representation of the union so
produced has duplicates in it, but we feel free to ignore or delete
duplicates.<p>

The beauty of this definition is that to combine two non-<code>nil</code> tag
trees you need do only one <code>cons</code>.<p>

The following function accumulates onto ans the set associated with
a given tag in a ttree:

<pre>
(defun tagged-objects (tag ttree ans)
 (cond
  ((null ttree) ans)
  ((symbolp (caar ttree))             ; ttree = ((tag . obj) . ttree)
   (tagged-objects tag (cdr ttree)
                   (cond ((eq (caar ttree) tag)
                          (add-to-set-equal (cdar ttree) ans))
                         (t ans))))
  (t                                  ; ttree = (ttree . ttree)
     (tagged-objects tag (cdr ttree)
                         (tagged-objects tag (car ttree) ans)))))
</pre>

This function is defined as a :<code><a href="PROGRAM.html">PROGRAM</a></code> mode function in ACL2.<p>

The rewriter, for example, takes a term and a ttree (among other
things), and returns a new term, term', and new ttree, ttree'.
Term' is equivalent to term (under the current assumptions) and the
ttree' is an extension of ttree.  If we focus just on the set
associated with the tag <code>LEMMA</code> in the ttrees, then the set for
ttree' is the extension of that for ttree obtained by unioning into
it all the runes used by the rewrite.  The set associated with
<code>LEMMA</code> can be obtained by <code>(tagged-objects 'LEMMA ttree nil)</code>.
