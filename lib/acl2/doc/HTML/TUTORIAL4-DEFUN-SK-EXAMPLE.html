<h3>TUTORIAL4-DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE</h3>example of quantified notions
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="TUTORIAL-EXAMPLES.html">TUTORIAL-EXAMPLES</a>
</pre><p>

This example illustrates the use of <code><a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></code> and <code><a href="DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></code>
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> to reason about quantifiers.  See <a href="DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a>.<p>

Many users prefer to avoid the use of quantifiers, since ACL2
provides only very limited support for reasoning about
quantifiers.
<p>
Here is a list of <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> that proves that if there are arbitrarily
large numbers satisfying the disjunction <code>(OR P R)</code>, then either
there are arbitrarily large numbers satisfying <code>P</code> or there are
arbitrarily large numbers satisfying <code>R</code>.

<pre><p>

; Introduce undefined predicates p and r.
(defstub p (x) t)
(defstub r (x) t)<p>

; Define the notion that something bigger than x satisfies p.
(defun-sk some-bigger-p (x)
  (exists y (and (&lt; x y) (p y))))<p>

; Define the notion that something bigger than x satisfies r.
(defun-sk some-bigger-r (x)
  (exists y (and (&lt; x y) (r y))))<p>

; Define the notion that arbitrarily large x satisfy p.
(defun-sk arb-lg-p ()
  (forall x (some-bigger-p x)))<p>

; Define the notion that arbitrarily large x satisfy r.
(defun-sk arb-lg-r ()
  (forall x (some-bigger-r x)))<p>

; Define the notion that something bigger than x satisfies p or r.
(defun-sk some-bigger-p-or-r (x)
  (exists y (and (&lt; x y) (or (p y) (r y)))))<p>

; Define the notion that arbitrarily large x satisfy p or r.
(defun-sk arb-lg-p-or-r ()
  (forall x (some-bigger-p-or-r x)))<p>

; Prove the theorem promised above.  Notice that the functions open
; automatically, but that we have to provide help for some rewrite
; rules because they have free variables in the hypotheses.  The
; ``witness functions'' mentioned below were introduced by DEFUN-SK.<p>

(thm
 (implies (arb-lg-p-or-r)
          (or (arb-lg-p)
              (arb-lg-r)))
 :hints (("Goal"
          :use
          ((:instance some-bigger-p-suff
                      (x (arb-lg-p-witness))
                      (y (some-bigger-p-or-r-witness 
                          (max (arb-lg-p-witness)
                               (arb-lg-r-witness)))))
           (:instance some-bigger-r-suff
                      (x (arb-lg-r-witness))
                      (y (some-bigger-p-or-r-witness 
                          (max (arb-lg-p-witness)
                               (arb-lg-r-witness)))))
           (:instance arb-lg-p-or-r-necc
                      (x (max (arb-lg-p-witness)
                              (arb-lg-r-witness))))))))<p>

; And finally, here's a cute little example.  We have already
; defined above the notion (some-bigger-p x), which says that
; something bigger than x satisfies p.  Let us introduce a notion
; that asserts that there exists both y and z bigger than x which
; satisfy p.  On first glance this new notion may appear to be
; stronger than the old one, but careful inspection shows that y and
; z do not have to be distinct.  In fact ACL2 realizes this, and
; proves the theorem below automatically.<p>

(defun-sk two-bigger-p (x)
  (exists (y z) (and (&lt; x y) (p y) (&lt; x z) (p z))))<p>

(thm (implies (some-bigger-p x) (two-bigger-p x)))<p>

; A technical point:  ACL2 fails to prove the theorem above
; automatically if we take its contrapositive, unless we disable
; two-bigger-p as shown below.  That is because ACL2 needs to expand
; some-bigger-p before applying the rewrite rule introduced for
; two-bigger-p, which contains free variables.  The moral of the
; story is:  Don't expect too much automatic support from ACL2 for
; reasoning about quantified notions.<p>

(thm (implies (not (two-bigger-p x)) (not (some-bigger-p x)))
     :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (disable two-bigger-p))))
