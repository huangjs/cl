<h2>TYPE-PRESCRIPTION</h2>make a rule that specifies the type of a term
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">RULE-CLASSES</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a general discussion of rule classes and
how they are used to build rules from formulas.  Some example
<code>:</code><code><a href="COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></code> formulas from which <code>:type-prescription</code> rules might be
built are:

<pre>
Examples:
(implies                           (nth n lst) is of type characterp
 (and (character-listp lst)        provided the two hypotheses can
      (&lt; n (length lst)))          be established by type reasoning
 (characterp (nth n lst))).<p>

(implies                           (demodulize a lst 'value ans) is
 (and (atom a)                     either a nonnegative integer or
      (true-listp lst)             of the same type as ans, provided
      (member-equal a lst))        the hyps can be established by type
 (or (and                          reasoning
       (integerp
        (demodulize a lst 'value ans))
       (&gt;= (demodulize a lst 'value ans) 0))
     (equal (demodulize a lst 'value ans) ans))).
</pre>

To specify the term whose type (see <a href="TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>) is described by
the rule, provide that term as the value of the <code>:typed-term</code> field
of the rule class object.
<p>

<pre>
General Form:
(implies hyps
         (or type-restriction1-on-pat
             ...
             type-restrictionk-on-pat
             (equal pat var1)
             ...
             (equal pat varj)))
</pre>

where <code>pat</code> is the application of some function symbol to some
arguments, each <code>type-restrictioni-on-pat</code> is a term involving <code>pat</code> and
containing no variables outside of the occurrences of <code>pat</code>, and each
<code>vari</code> is one of the variables of <code>pat</code>.  Generally speaking, the
<code>type-restriction</code> terms ought to be terms that inform us as to the
type of <code>pat</code>.  Ideally, they should be ``primitive recognizing
expressions'' about <code>pat</code>; see <a href="COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a>.<p>

If the <code>:typed-term</code> is not provided in the rule class object, it is
computed heuristically by looking for a term in the conclusion whose
type is being restricted.  An error is caused if no such term is
found.<p>

Roughly speaking, the effect of adding such a rule is to inform the
ACL2 typing mechanism that <code>pat</code> has the type described by the
conclusion, when the hypotheses are true.  In particular, the type
of <code>pat</code> is within the union of the types described by the several
disjuncts.  The ``type described by'' <code>(equal pat vari)</code> is the type
of <code>vari</code>.<p>

More operationally, when asked to determine the type of a term that
is an instance of <code>pat</code>, ACL2 will first attempt to establish the
hypotheses.  <strong>This is done by type reasoning alone, not rewriting!</strong>
Of course, if some hypothesis is to be forced, it is so
treated; see <a href="FORCE.html">force</a> and see <a href="CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>.  So-called free variables in
hypotheses are treated specially; see <a href="FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>.  Provided the
hypotheses are established by type reasoning, ACL2 then unions the
types described by the <code>type-restrictioni-on-pat</code> terms together
with the types of those subexpressions of <code>pat</code> identified by the
<code>vari</code>.  The final type computed for a term is the intersection of
the types implied by each applicable rule.  Type prescription rules
may be disabled.<p>

Because only type reasoning is used to establish the hypotheses of
<code>:type-prescription</code> rules, some care must be taken with the
hypotheses.  Suppose, for example, that the non-recursive function
<code>my-statep</code> is defined as

<pre>
  (defun my-statep (x)
    (and (true-listp x)
         (equal (length x) 2)))
</pre>

and suppose <code>(my-statep s)</code> occurs as a hypothesis of a
<code>:type-prescription</code> rule that is being considered for use in the
proof attempt for a conjecture with the hypothesis <code>(my-statep s)</code>.
Since the hypothesis in the conjecture is rewritten, it will become
the conjunction of <code>(true-listp s)</code> and <code>(equal (length s) 2)</code>.
Those two terms will be assumed to have type <code>t</code> in the context in
which the <code>:type-prescription</code> rule is tried.  But type reasoning will
be unable to deduce that <code>(my-statep s)</code> has type <code>t</code> in this
context.  Thus, either <code>my-statep</code> should be disabled
(see <a href="DISABLE.html">disable</a>) during the proof attempt or else the occurrence
of <code>(my-statep s)</code> in the <code>:type-prescription</code> rule should be
replaced by the conjunction into which it rewrites.<p>

While this example makes it clear how non-recursive predicates can
cause problems, non-recursive functions in general can cause
problems.  For example, if <code>(mitigate x)</code> is defined to be
<code>(if (rationalp x) (1- x) x)</code> then the hypothesis
<code>(pred (mitigate s))</code> in the conjecture will rewrite, opening
<code>mitigate</code> and splitting the conjecture into two subgoals, one in
which <code>(rationalp s)</code> and <code>(pred (1- x))</code> are assumed and the
other in which <code>(not (rationalp s))</code> and <code>(pred x)</code> are assumed.
But <code>(pred (mitigate s))</code> will not be typed as <code>t</code> in either of
these contexts.  The moral is: beware of non-recursive functions
occuring in the hypotheses of <code>:type-prescription</code> rules.<p>

Because of the freedom one has in forming the conclusion of a
type-prescription, we have to use heuristics to recover the pattern,
<code>pat</code>, whose type is being specified.  In some cases our heuristics
may not identify the intended term and the <code>:type-prescription</code>
rule will be rejected as illegal because the conclusion is not of
the correct form.  When this happens you may wish to specify the <code>pat</code>
directly.  This may be done by using a suitable rule class token.
In particular, when the token <code>:type-prescription</code> is used it means
ACL2 is to compute pat with its heuristics; otherwise the token
should be of the form <code>(:type-prescription :typed-term pat)</code>, where
<code>pat</code> is the term whose type is being specified.<p>

The defun event may generate a <code>:type-prescription</code> rule.  Suppose
<code>fn</code> is the name of the function concerned.  Then
<code>(:type-prescription fn)</code> is the rune given to the
type-prescription, if any, generated for <code>fn</code> by <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code>.  (The
trivial rule, saying <code>fn</code> has unknown type, is not stored, but
<code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> still allocates the rune and the corollary of this rune is
known to be <code>t</code>.)
