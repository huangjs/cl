<h2>TYPE-SET</h2>how type information is encoded in ACL2

To help you experiment with type-sets we briefly note the following
utility functions.<p>

<code>(type-set-quote x)</code> will return the type-set of the object <code>x</code>.  For
example, <code>(type-set-quote "test")</code> is <code>2048</code> and
<code>(type-set-quote '(a b c))</code> is <code>512</code>.<p>

<code>(type-set 'term nil nil nil nil (ens state) (w state) nil nil nil)</code> will
return the type-set of <code>term</code>.  For example,

<pre>
(type-set '(integerp x) nil nil nil nil (ens state) (w state) nil nil nil)
</pre>

will return (mv 192 nil).  192, otherwise known as <code>*ts-boolean*</code>,
is the type-set containing <code>t</code> and <code>nil</code>.  The second result may
be ignored in these experiments.  <code>Term</code> must be in the
<code>translated</code>, internal form shown by <code>:</code><code><a href="TRANS.html">trans</a></code>.  See <a href="TRANS.html">trans</a>
and see <a href="TERM.html">term</a>.<p>

<code>(type-set-implied-by-term 'x nil 'term (ens state)(w state) nil)</code>
will return the type-set deduced for the variable symbol <code>x</code> assuming
the <code>translated</code> term, <code>term</code>, true.  The second result may be ignored
in these experiments.  For example,

<pre>
(type-set-implied-by-term 'v nil '(integerp v)
                          (ens state) (w state) nil)
</pre>

returns <code>11</code>.<p>

<code>(convert-type-set-to-term 'x ts (ens state) (w state) nil)</code> will
return a term whose truth is equivalent to the assertion that the
term <code>x</code> has type-set <code>ts</code>.  The second result may be ignored in these
experiments.  For example

<pre>
(convert-type-set-to-term 'v 523 (ens state) (w state) nil)
</pre>

returns a term expressing the claim that <code>v</code> is either an integer
or a non-<code>nil</code> true-list.  <code>523</code> is the <code>logical-or</code> of <code>11</code> (which
denotes the integers) with <code>512</code> (which denotes the non-<code>nil</code>
true-lists).
<p>
The ``actual primitive types'' of ACL2 are listed in
<code>*actual-primitive-types*</code>, whose elements are shown below.  Each
actual primitive type denotes a set -- sometimes finite and
sometimes not -- of ACL2 objects and these sets are pairwise
disjoint.  For example, <code>*ts-zero*</code> denotes the set containing 0 while
<code>*ts-positive-integer*</code> denotes the set containing all of the positive
integers.

<pre>
*TS-ZERO*                  ;;; {0}
*TS-POSITIVE-INTEGER*      ;;; positive integers
*TS-POSITIVE-RATIO*        ;;; positive non-integer rationals
*TS-NEGATIVE-INTEGER*      ;;; negative integers
*TS-NEGATIVE-RATIO*        ;;; negative non-integer rationals
*TS-COMPLEX-RATIONAL*      ;;; complex rationals
*TS-NIL*                   ;;; {nil}
*TS-T*                     ;;; {t}
*TS-NON-T-NON-NIL-SYMBOL*  ;;; symbols other than nil, t
*TS-PROPER-CONS*           ;;; null-terminated non-empty lists
*TS-IMPROPER-CONS*         ;;; conses that are not proper
*TS-STRING*                ;;; strings
*TS-CHARACTER*             ;;; characters
</pre>
<p>

The actual primitive types were chosen by us to make theorem proving
convenient.  Thus, for example, the actual primitive type <code>*ts-nil*</code>
contains just <code>nil</code> so that we can encode the hypothesis ``<code>x</code> is <code>nil</code>''
by saying ``<code>x</code> has type <code>*ts-nil*</code>'' and the hypothesis ``<code>x</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>'' by saying ``<code>x</code> has type complement of <code>*ts-nil*</code>.''  We
similarly devote a primitive type to <code>t</code>, <code>*ts-t*</code>, and to a third type,
<code>*ts-non-t-non-nil-symbol*</code>, to contain all the other ACL2 symbols.<p>

Let <code>*ts-other*</code> denote the set of all Common Lisp objects other than
those in the actual primitive types.  Thus, <code>*ts-other*</code> includes such
things as floating point numbers and CLTL array objects.  The actual
primitive types together with <code>*ts-other*</code> constitute what we call
<code>*universe*</code>.  Note that <code>*universe*</code> is a finite set containing one
more object than there are actual primitive types; that is, here we
are using <code>*universe*</code> to mean the finite set of primitive types, not
the infinite set of all objects in all of those primitive types.
<code>*Universe*</code> is a partitioning of the set of all Common Lisp objects:
every object belongs to exactly one of the sets in <code>*universe*</code>.<p>

Abstractly, a ``type-set'' is a subset of <code>*universe*</code>.  To say that a
term, <code>x</code>, ``has type-set <code>ts</code>'' means that under all possible
assignments to the variables in <code>x</code>, the value of <code>x</code> is a member of
some member of <code>ts</code>.  Thus, <code>(cons x y)</code> has type-set
<code>{*ts-proper-cons* *ts-improper-cons*}</code>.  A term can have more than
one type-set.  For example, <code>(cons x y)</code> also has the type-set
<code>{*ts-proper-cons* *ts-improper-cons* *ts-nil*}</code>.  Extraneous types
can be added to a type-set without invalidating the claim that a
term ``has'' that type-set.  Generally we are interested in the
smallest type-set a term has, but because the entire theorem-proving
problem for ACL2 can be encoded as a type-set question, namely,
``Does <code>p</code> have type-set complement of <code>*ts-nil*</code>?,'' finding the
smallest type-set for a term is an undecidable problem.  When we
speak informally of ``the'' type-set we generally mean ``the
type-set found by our heuristics'' or ``the type-set assumed in the
current context.''<p>

Note that if a type-set, <code>ts</code>, does not contain <code>*ts-other*</code> as an
element then it is just a subset of the actual primitive types.  If
it does contain <code>*ts-other*</code> it can be obtained by subtracting from
<code>*universe*</code> the complement of <code>ts</code>.  Thus, every type-set can be
written as a (possibly complemented) subset of the actual primitive
types.<p>

By assigning a unique bit position to each actual primitive type we
can encode every subset, <code>s</code>, of the actual primitive types by the
nonnegative integer whose ith bit is on precisely if <code>s</code> contains the
ith actual primitive type.  The type-sets written as the complement
of <code>s</code> are encoded as the <code>twos-complement</code> of the encoding of <code>s</code>.  Those
type-sets are thus negative integers.  The bit positions assigned to
the actual primitive types are enumerated from <code>0</code> in the same order
as the types are listed in <code>*actual-primitive-types*</code>.  At the
concrete level, a type-set is an integer between <code>*min-type-set*</code> and
<code>*max-type-set*</code>, inclusive.<p>

For example, <code>*ts-nil*</code> has bit position <code>6</code>.  The type-set containing
just <code>*ts-nil*</code> is thus represented by <code>64</code>.  If a term has type-set <code>64</code>
then the term is always equal to <code>nil</code>.  The type-set containing
everything but <code>*ts-nil*</code> is the twos-complement of <code>64</code>, which is <code>-65</code>.
If a term has type-set <code>-65</code>, it is never equal to <code>nil</code>.  By ``always''
and ``never'' we mean under all, or under no, assignments to the
variables, respectively.<p>

Here is a more complicated example.  Let <code>s</code> be the type-set
containing all of the symbols and the natural numbers.  The relevant
actual primitive types, their bit positions and their encodings are:

<pre>
actual primitive type       bit    value<p>

*ts-zero*                    0       1
*ts-positive-integer*        1       2
*ts-nil*                     6      64
*ts-t*                       7     128
*ts-non-t-non-nil-symbol*    8     256
</pre>

Thus, the type-set <code>s</code> is represented by <code>(+ 1 2 64 128 256)</code> = <code>451</code>.
The complement of <code>s</code>, i.e., the set of all objects other than the
natural numbers and the symbols, is <code>-452</code>.
