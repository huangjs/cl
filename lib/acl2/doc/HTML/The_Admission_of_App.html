<h2>The Admission of App</h2>
<p>
Here is what it looks like to submit the definition of <code>app</code> to ACL2:<p>

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;<b>(defun app (x y)</B>
  <b>(cond ((endp x) y)</B>
        <b>(t (cons (car x) </B>
                 <b>(app (cdr x) y)))))</B><p>

The admission of APP is trivial, using the relation O&lt; (which
is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized by O-P)
and the measure (ACL2-COUNT X).  We observe that the type of APP is
described by the theorem (OR (CONSP (APP X Y)) (EQUAL (APP X Y) Y)).
We used primitive type reasoning.<p>

The text between the lines above is one interaction with the ACL2 command
loop.<p>

Above you see the user's <b>input</B> and how the system responds.
This little example shows you what the syntax looks like and is a
very typical <b>successful</B> interaction with the definitional
principle.<p>

Let's look at it a little more closely.<p>
