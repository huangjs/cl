Observe that, for the particular <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> above,
<code>(app (app a b) c)</code> returns the same thing as <code>(app a (app b c))</code>.
Perhaps <code>app</code> is <b>associative</B>.  Of course, to be associative means
that the above property must hold for all values of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>,
not just the ones <b>tested</B> above.<p>

Wouldn't it be cool if you could type

<pre>
ACL2!&gt;<b>(equal (app (app a b) c)</B>
             <b>(app a (app b c)))</B>

</pre>

and have ACL2 compute the value <code>T</code>?  Well, <b>you can't!</B>  If you try
it, you'll get an error message!  The message says we can't evaluate
that form because it contains <b>free</B> variables, i.e., variables
not given values.  Click <a href="Free_Variables_in_Top-Level_Input.html">here</a> to see the
message.<p>

We cannot evaluate a form on an infinite number of cases.  But we can
prove that a form is a theorem and hence know that it will always
evaluate to true.<p>
