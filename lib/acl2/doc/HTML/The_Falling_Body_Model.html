<h2>The Falling Body Model</h2>

One particularly famous and very simple model is the equation of a
falling body:  the distance d an object falls is proportional to the
square of the time t.  If the time is measured in seconds and the
distance in feet, the equation relating these two is

<pre>
       2
d = 16t
</pre>
  <p>

This equation is a <b>model</B> of falling objects.  It can be used to
predict how long it takes a cannonball to fall from the top of a 200
foot tower (3.5 seconds).  This might be important if your product
is designed to drop cannonballs on moving targets.<p>
