<h2>The First Application of the Associativity Rule</h2>
<p>
So here we see our associativity rule being used!<p>

The rewriter sweeps the conjecture in a <b>leftmost innermost</B> fashion,
applying rewrite rules as it goes.<p>

The associativity rule is used many times in this sweep.  The
first ``target'' is highlighted below.  Click on it to see what
happens:

<pre>
<b>Current Conjecture</B>:
(equal (app (app <a href="A_Sketch_of_How_the_Rewriter_Works.html">(app (app x1 x2) (app x3 x4))</a> (app x5 x6)) x7)
       (app x1 (app (app x2 x3) (app (app x4 x5) (app x6 x7)))))
</pre>
