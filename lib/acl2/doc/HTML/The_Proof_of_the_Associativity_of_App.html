<h2>The Proof of the Associativity of App</h2>
<p>
Here is the theorem prover's output when it processes the <b>defthm</B>
command for the associativity of <code>app</code>.  We have highlighted text
for which we offer some explanation, and broken the presentation into
several pages.  Just follow the Walking Tour after exploring the
explanations.<p>

Name the formula above <a href="Name_the_Formula_Above.html">*1</a>.<p>

<a href="Perhaps.html">Perhaps</a> we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are
<a href="Suggested_Inductions_in_the_Associativity_of_App_Example.html">suggested</a> by this conjecture.  <a href="Subsumption_of_Induction_Candidates_in_App_Example.html">Subsumption</a> reduces that number to two.
However, one of these is <a href="Flawed_Induction_Candidates_in_App_Example.html">flawed</a> and so we are left with one viable
candidate.  <p>

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (APP A B).  If we
let  (:P A B C) denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll use
is
<a href="The_Induction_Scheme_Selected_for_the_App_Example.html">(</a>AND
   <a href="The_Induction_Step_in_the_App_Example.html">(</a>IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP A))
                 (:P (CDR A) B C))
            (:P A B C))
   <a href="The_Base_Case_in_the_App_Example.html">(</a>IMPLIES (ENDP A) (:P A B C))).
This induction is <a href="The_Justification_of_the_Induction_Scheme.html">justified</a> by the same argument used to admit APP,
namely, the measure (ACL2-COUNT A) is decreasing according to the relation
O&lt; (which is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized
by O-P).  When <a href="The_Instantiation_of_the_Induction_Scheme.html">applied</a> to the goal at hand the above induction
scheme produces the following two <a href="Nontautological_Subgoals.html">nontautological subgoals</a>.<p>
