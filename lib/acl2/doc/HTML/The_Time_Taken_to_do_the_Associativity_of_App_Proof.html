<h2>The Time Taken to do the Associativity of App Proof</h2>
<p>
The time it took us to explain this proof may leave the impression that
the proof is complicated.  In a way, it is.  But it happens quickly.<p>

The time taken to do this proof is about 1/10 second.  The rest of
the time (about 2/10 seconds) is spent in pre- and post-processing.<p>

Basically, this proof flashes across your screen before you can read
it; you see the <b>Q.E.D.</B> and don't bother to scroll back to
read it.  You have more important things to do than read successful
proofs.
