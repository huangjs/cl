<h2>The Tours</h2>
<p>
ACL2 is a very large, multipurpose system.  You can use it as a
programming language, a specification language, a modeling language,
a formal mathematical logic, or a semi-automatic theorem prover,
just to name its most common uses.<p>

This home page includes all of ACL2's online documentation, which is
quite extensive.  To help ease your introduction to ACL2, we have
built two tours through this documentation.<p>

Newcomers to ACL2 should first take the ``Flying Tour.''  Then, if
you want to know more, take the ``Walking Tour.''<p>

To start a tour, click on the appropriate icon below.<p>

For readers using Web browsers:  This ``page'' actually contains many
other pages of our documentation, organized alphabetically and separated
by many blank lines.  Be careful when using the scroll bar!<p>

For readers using our :DOC or our TexInfo format in Emacs:  The tours
will probably be unsatisfying because we use gif files and assume you
can navigate ``back.''
