<h2>The WARNING about the Trivial Consequence</h2>
<p>
This <b>Warning</B> alerts us to the fact that when treated as a
<b>rewrite</B> rule, the new rule <code>TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE</code>, rewrites
terms of the same form as a rule we have already proved, namely
<code>ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-APP</code>.<p>

When you see this warning you should <b>think about your rules</B>!<p>

In the current case, it would be a good idea <b>not</B> to make
<code>TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE</code> a rule at all.  We could do this with
:<code><a href="RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></code> <a href="A_Tiny_Warning_Sign.html"><img src=twarning.gif></a> nil.<p>

ACL2 proceeds to try to prove the theorem, even though it printed
some warnings.  The basic assumption in ACL2 is that the <b>user</B>
<b>understands what he or she is doing</B> but may need a little reminding
just to manage a complicated set of facts.
