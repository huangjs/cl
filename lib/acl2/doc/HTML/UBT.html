<h2>UBT</h2>undo the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s back through a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor

<pre>
Examples:
:ubt :max      ; undo back through the most recent command
               ; (which just means undo the most recent command)
:ubt :x        ; same as :ubt :max
:u             ; same as :ubt :max with no questions asked
:ubt fn        ; undo back through the introduction of fn
               ; (including all the other events in fn's block)
:ubt 5         ; undo back through the fifth command executed
:ubt (:max -4) ; undo back through the most recent five commands
:ubt (:x -4)   ; undo back through the most recent five commands
</pre>

See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.
<p>
<code>Ubt</code> takes one argument, a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor, and undoes the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s from <code>:</code><code><a href="MAX.html">max</a></code> (aka <code>:x</code>) through the one described.
See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.  <code><a href="PBT.html">Pbt</a></code> will print the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s that <code>ubt</code>
will undo.  <code>:</code><code><a href="OOPS.html">Oops</a></code> will undo the undo.  See <a href="OOPS.html">oops</a>.<p>

<code>Ubt</code> can cause errors or queries.  To avoid these, see <a href="UBT_bang_.html">ubt!</a>.<p>

It is important to remember that a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> may create several
<a href="EVENTS.html">events</a>.  That is, the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> that introduces <code>fn1</code> may also introduce
<code>fn2</code>.  Undoing the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> that created either of these will undo
them both.  The <a href="EVENTS.html">events</a> created by a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> constitute the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>'s
``block'' and we can only undo entire blocks.  Use <code><a href="PCB.html">pcb</a></code> to print the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> block of a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> if you wish to see what will be lost by
undoing the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>.<p>

<code>Ubt</code> will not undo into ``prehistory''.  <code>:Ubt 1</code> will undo all of your
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s.  But <code>:ubt -5</code> will cause an error, warning you that <code>:ubt</code>
cannot undo system initialization.<p>

See <a href="U.html">u</a> for how to undo just the latest command, and see <a href="UBU.html">ubu</a> and see <a href="UBU_bang_.html">ubu!</a> for
how to undo back up to, but not including, the current command.
