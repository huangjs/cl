<h2>UBU</h2>undo the <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s back up to (not including) a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="HISTORY.html">HISTORY</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
:ubu :x-3      ; undo the last three commands (same as :ubt :x-2)
:ubu (:x -3)   ; same as above
:ubu fn        ; undo back up to, but not including the introduction of fn
               ; (so fn will continue to be defined)
:ubu 5         ; undo back up to, but not including, the fifth command
               ; executed (leaving the first five commands in place)
</pre>

See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.
<p>
<code>Ubu</code> takes one argument, a <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor, and undoes the
<a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s from <code>:</code><code><a href="MAX.html">max</a></code> (aka <code>:x</code>) up to, but not including, the
indicated command.  See <a href="COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.<p>

<code>Ubu</code> can cause errors or queries.  To avoid these, see <a href="UBU_bang_.html">ubu!</a>.<p>

Also see <a href="UBT.html">ubt</a>, which is similar but also undoes the indicated command.  As
for <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT.html">ubt</a></code>, <code>:</code><code><a href="OOPS.html">oops</a></code> will undo the undo (see <a href="OOPS.html">oops</a>) and
<code><a href="UBU.html">ubu</a></code> will not undo into ``prehistory''.<p>

See <a href="U.html">u</a> for how to undo just the latest command, and see <a href="UBT.html">ubt</a> and see <a href="UBT_bang_.html">ubt!</a> for
how to undo back through (that is, including) the current command.
