<h2>UNMONITOR</h2>to stop monitoring a rule name
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">BREAK-REWRITE</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Examples:
(unmonitor '(:rewrite assoc-of-app))
:unmonitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app)
:unmonitor :all
<p>
General Forms:
(unmonitor rune)
(unmonitor :all)
</pre>

Here, <code>rune</code> is a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> that is currently among those with break points
installed.  This function removes the break.<p>

Subtle point:  Because you may want to unmonitor a ``<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>'' that is
no longer a <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> in the current ACL2 <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>, we don't actually check
this about <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>.  Instead, we simply check that <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> is a <code>consp</code>
beginning with a <code>keywordp</code>.  That way, you'll know you've made a
mistake if you try to <code>:unmonitor binary-append</code> instead of
<code>:unmonitor (:definition binary-append)</code>, for example.
