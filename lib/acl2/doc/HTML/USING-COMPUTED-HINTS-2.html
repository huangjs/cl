<h2>USING-COMPUTED-HINTS-2</h2>One Hint to Every Top-Level Goal in a Forcing Round
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="MISCELLANEOUS.html">MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</pre><p>
<p>
Suppose the main proof completes with a forcing round on three
subgoals, "[1]Subgoal 3", "[1]Subgoal 2", and "[1]Subgoal 1".
Suppose you wish to <code>:use lemma42</code> in all top-level goals of the
first forcing round.  This can be done supplying the hint

<pre>
(if test '(:use lemma42) nil),
</pre>

where <code>test</code> is an expression that returns
<code>t</code> when <code>ID</code> is one of the clause ids in question.

<pre>
    goal-spec     (parse-clause-id goal-spec)<p>

"[1]Subgoal 3"        ((1) (3) . 0)
"[1]Subgoal 2"        ((1) (2) . 0)
"[1]Subgoal 1"        ((1) (1) . 0)
</pre>

Recall (see <a href="CLAUSE-IDENTIFIER.html">clause-identifier</a>) that <code>parse-clause-id</code> maps
from a goal spec to a clause id, so you can use that function on the
goal specs printed in the failed proof attempt to determine the
clause ids in question.<p>

So one acceptable <code>test</code> is

<pre>
(member-equal id '(((1) (3) . 0) 
                   ((1) (2) . 0)
                   ((1) (1) . 0)))
</pre>

or you could use <code>parse-clause-id</code> in your computed hint if you
don't want to see clause ids in your script:

<pre>
(or (equal id (parse-clause-id "[1]Subgoal 3"))
    (equal id (parse-clause-id "[1]Subgoal 2"))
    (equal id (parse-clause-id "[1]Subgoal 1")))
</pre>

or you could use the inverse function (see <a href="CLAUSE-IDENTIFIER.html">clause-identifier</a>):

<pre>
(member-equal (string-for-tilde-@-clause-id-phrase id)
              '("[1]Subgoal 3"
                "[1]Subgoal 2"
                "[1]Subgoal 1"))
</pre>
<p>

Recall that what we've shown above are the tests to use in the
computed hint.  The hint itself is <code>(if test '(:use lemma42) nil)</code>
or something equivalent like <code>(and test '(:use lemma42))</code>.<p>

The three tests above are all equivalent.  They suffer from the
problem of requiring the explicit enumeration of all the goal specs
in the first forcing round.  A change in the script might cause more
forced subgoals and the ones other than those enumerated would not
be given the hint.<p>

You could write a test that recognizes all first round top-level
subgoals no matter how many there are.  Just think of the
programming problem:  how do I recognize all the clause id's of the
form <code>((1) (n) . 0)</code>?  Often you can come to this formulation of
the problem by using <code>parse-clause-id</code> on a few of the candidate
goal-specs to see the common structure.  A suitable test in this
case is:

<pre>
(and (equal (car id) '(1))     ; forcing round 1, top-level (pre-induction)
     (equal (len (cadr id)) 1) ; Subgoal n (not Subgoal n.i ...)
     (equal (cddr id) 0))      ; no primes
</pre>
<p>

The test above is ``overkill'' because it recognizes precisely the
clause ids in question.  But recall that once a computed hint is
used, it is (by default) removed from the hints available to the
children of the clause.  Thus, we can widen the set of clause ids
recognized to include all the children without worrying that the
hint will be applied to those children.<p>

In particular, the following test supplies the hint to every
top-level goal of the first forcing round:

<pre>
(equal (car id) '(1))
</pre>

You might worry that it would also supply the hint to the subgoal
produced by the hint -- the cases we ruled out by the ``overkill''
above.  But that doesn't happen since the hint is unavailable to the
children.  You could even write:

<pre>
(equal (car (car id)) 1)
</pre>

which would supply the hint to every goal of the form "[1]Subgoal ..."
and again, because we see and fire on the top-level goals first, we
will not fire on, say, "[1]Subgoal *1.3/2", i.e., the id '((1 1 3)
(2) . 0) even though the test recognizes that id.<p>

Finally, the following test supplies the hint to every top-level goal
of every forcing round (except the 0th, which is the ``gist'' of the
proof, not ``really'' a forcing round):

<pre>
(not (equal (car (car id)) 0))
</pre>
<p>

Recall again that in all the examples above we have exhibited the
<code>test</code> in a computed hint of the form <code>(if test '(:key1 val1 ...) nil)</code>.
