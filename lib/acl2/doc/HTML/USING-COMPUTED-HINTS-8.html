None of the examples show the use of the variable <code>WORLD</code>, which is
allowed in computed hints.  There are some (undocumented) ACL2
utilities that might be useful in programming hints, but these
utilities need access to the ACL2 logical world (see <a href="WORLD.html">world</a>).<p>

A very useful fact to know is that <code>(table-alist name world)</code>
returns an alist representation of the current value of the <code><a href="TABLE.html">table</a></code>
named <code>name</code>.<p>

The ACL2 source code is littered with <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode 
functions for manipulating world.  In our source code, the
world is usually bound a variable named <code>wrld</code>; so searching
our code for that name might be helpful.
<p>
Using these utilities to look at the <code>WORLD</code> one can, for example,
determine whether a symbol is defined recursively or not, get the
body and formals of a defined function, or fetch the statement of a
given lemma.  Because these utilities are not yet documented, we do
not expect users to employ <code>WORLD</code> in computed hints.  But experts
might and it might lead to the formulation of a more convenient
language for computed hints.<p>

None of our examples illustrated the 7 argument form of a computed
hint, 
<code>(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP HIST PSPV CTX)</code>.
When used, the variables <code>HIST</code>, <code>PSPV</code>, and <code>CTX</code>, are bound
to the clause history, the package of ``special variables'' governing
the clause, and the ``error message context.''  These variables are
commonly used throughout our source code but are, unfortunately,
undocumented.  Again, we expect a few experts will find them useful
in developing computed hints.<p>

If you start using computed hints extensively, please contact the
developers of ACL2 and let us know what you are doing with them and
how we can help.
