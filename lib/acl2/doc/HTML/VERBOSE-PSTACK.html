<h3>VERBOSE-PSTACK</h3>seeing what is the prover up to (for advanced users)
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="PSTACK.html">PSTACK</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
General Forms:
(verbose-pstack t)   ; get trace-like information on prover during proofs
(verbose-pstack '(fn1 fn2 ...))
                     ; as above, but omit calls of the indicated functions
(verbose-pstack nil) ; turn off trace-like information on prover
</pre>

For example, (verbose-pstack '(ev-fncall)) will provide a trace of various
prover functions during proofs, except for the function <code>ev-fncall</code>.<p>

By evaluating <code>(verbose-pstack t)</code> one can get trace-like information
during subsequent proofs about prover functions, including time summaries,
printed to the screen during a proof.  To turn off this feature, evaluate
<code>(verbose-pstack nil)</code>.  Also See <a href="PSTACK.html">pstack</a>.
