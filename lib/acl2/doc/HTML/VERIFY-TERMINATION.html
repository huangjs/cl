<h2>VERIFY-TERMINATION</h2>convert a function from :program mode to :logic mode
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
(verify-termination fact)
<p>
General Forms:
(verify-termination fn dcl ... dcl)
(verify-termination (fn1 dcl ... dcl)
                    (fn2 dcl ... dcl)
                    ...)
</pre>

where <code>fn</code> and the <code>fni</code> are function symbols having <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode
(see <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>) and all of the <code>dcl</code>s are either <code><a href="DECLARE.html">declare</a></code>
forms or <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings.  The first form above is an
abbreviation for

<pre>
(verify-termination (fn dcl ... dcl))
</pre>

so we limit our discussion to the second form.  Each of the <code>fni</code>
must be in the same clique of mutually recursively defined
functions, but not every function in the clique need be among the
<code>fni</code>.<p>

<code>Verify-termination</code> attempts to establish the admissibility of the
<code>fni</code>. <code>Verify-termination</code> retrieves their definitions, creates modified
definitions using the <code>dcl</code>s supplied above, and resubmits these
definitions.  You could avoid using <code>verify-termination</code> by typing the new
definitions yourself.  So in that sense, <code>verify-termination</code> adds no new
functionality.  But if you have prototyped your system in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code>
mode and tested it, you can use <code>verify-termination</code> to resubmit your
definitions and change their <a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>s to <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>, addings
<a href="HINTS.html">hints</a> without having to retype or recopy the code.<p>

The <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> executed by <code>verify-termination</code> is obtained
by retrieving the <code><a href="DEFUN.html">defun</a></code> (or <code><a href="MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></code>) <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> that
introduced the clique in question and then possibly modifying each definition
as follows.  Consider a function, <code>fn</code>, in the clique.  If <code>fn</code> is not
among the <code>fni</code> above, its definition is left unmodified other than to add
<code>(declare (xargs :mode :logic))</code>.  Otherwise, <code>fn</code> is some <code>fni</code> and we
modify its definition by inserting into it the corresponding <code>dcl</code>s listed
with <code>fni</code> in the arguments to <code>verify-termination</code>, as well as
<code>(declare (xargs :mode :logic))</code>.  In addition, we throw out from the old
declarations in <code>fn</code> the <code>:mode</code> specification and anything that is
specified in the new <code>dcl</code>s.<p>

For example, suppose that <code>fact</code> was introduced with:

<pre>
(defun fact (n)
  (declare (type integer n)
           (xargs :mode :program))
  (if (zp n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))).
</pre>

Suppose later we do <code>(verify-termination fact)</code>.  Then the
following definition is submitted.

<pre>
(defun fact (n)
  (declare (type integer n))
  (if (zp n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n))))).
</pre>

Observe that this is the same definition as the original one, except
the old specification of the <code>:mode</code> has been deleted so that the
<a href="DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> now defaults to <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code>.  Although the termination
proof succeeds, ACL2 also tries to verify the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, because we have
(implicitly) provided a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, namely <code>(integerp n)</code>, for this
function.  (See <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> for a general discussion of guards, and
see <a href="TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a> for a discussion of how type declarations are
used in guards.)  Unfortunately, the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> verification fails,
because the subterm <code>(zp n)</code> requires that <code>n</code> be nonnegative, as
can be seen by invoking <code>:args zp</code>.  (For a discussion of termination
issues relating to recursion on the naturals, see <a href="ZERO-TEST-IDIOMS.html">zero-test-idioms</a>.)
So we might be tempted to submit the following:

<pre>
(verify-termination
 fact 
 (declare (xargs :guard (and (integerp n) (&lt;= 0 n))))).
</pre>

However, this is considered a changing of the guard (from <code>(integerp n)</code>),
which is illegal.  If we instead change the guard in the earlier <code>defun</code>
after undoing that earlier definition with <code>:</code><code><a href="UBT.html">ubt</a></code><code> fact</code>, then
<code>(verify-termination fact)</code> will succeed.
