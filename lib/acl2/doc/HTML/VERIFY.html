Examples:
(VERIFY (implies (and (true-listp x) (true-listp y))
                      (equal (append (append x y) z)
                             (append x (append y z)))))
   -- Attempt to prove the given term interactively.<p>

(VERIFY (p x)
        :event-name p-always-holds
        :rule-classes (:rewrite :generalize)
        :instructions ((rewrite p-always-holds-lemma)
                       change-goal))
   -- Attempt to prove (p x), where the intention is to call the
      resulting DEFTHM event by the name p-always-holds, with
      rule-classes as indicated.  The two indicated instructions
      will be run immediately to start the proof.<p>

(VERIFY)
   -- Re-enter the proof-checker in the state at which is was last
      left.<p>
