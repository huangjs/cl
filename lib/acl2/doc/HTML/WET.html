<h2>WET</h2>evaluate a form and print subsequent error trace
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="TRACE.html">TRACE</a>
</pre><p>

NOTE:  This feature is onlyh available if you are using GCL, Allegro CL, or
CLISP.

<pre>
Examples:
(wet (bar 3))            ; evaluate (bar 3) and print backtrace upon error
(wet (bar 3) nil)        ; as above, but avoid hiding the structure of bar
(wet (bar 3) (evisc-tuple 3 5 nil nil))
                         ; as above, but hiding the structure of bar up to
                         ; level 3 and length 5
(wet (bar 3) :fns (f g)) ; as above but only include calls of f, g
<p>
General Forms (all but the first argument may be omitted):
(wet form
     evisc-tuple ; optional, and evaluated
     :fns  (f1 f2 ... fk)
     :omit (g1 g2 ... gk))
</pre>

where <code>form</code> is an arbitrary ACL2 form and the <code>fi</code> are function symbols
whose calls are to appear in the backtrace if the evaluation of <code>form</code>
aborts.  Generally, <code>wet</code> will hide parts of large structures that it
prints out, but this can be avoided by supplying a value of <code>nil</code> for
<code>evisc-tuple</code>.<p>

More generally, the <code>evisc-tuple</code> argument, which is evaluated, can be
supplied to specify the print-level and print-length for the resulting
backtrace; see <a href="LD-EVISC-TUPLE.html">ld-evisc-tuple</a>.<p>

If the value of <code>:fns</code> is <code>nil</code> or not supplied, then calls of all
functions appear in the backtrace, with the exception of built-in functions
that are either in the main Lisp package or are in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode.
(In particular, all user-defined functions appear.)  The above description is
modified if <code>:omit</code> is supplied, in which case calls of the specified
function symbols are removed from the backtrace.<p>

The following example illustrates the use of <code>wet</code>, which stands for
``<code><a href="WITH-ERROR-TRACE.html">with-error-trace</a></code>''.  We omit uninteresting output from this example.

<pre>
ACL2 !&gt;(defun foo (x) (car x))
 ...
 FOO
ACL2 !&gt;(defun bar (x) (foo x))
 ...
 BAR
ACL2 !&gt;(bar 3)<p>


ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function symbol CAR, which
is (OR (CONSP X) (EQUAL X NIL)), is violated by the arguments in the
call (CAR 3).  To see a trace of calls leading up to this violation,
execute (wet &lt;form&gt;) where &lt;form&gt; is the form you submitted to the
ACL2 loop.  See :DOC wet for how to get an error backtrace.<p>

ACL2 !&gt;(wet (bar 3))<p>


ACL2 Error in WITH-ERROR-TRACE:  The guard for the function symbol
CAR, which is (OR (CONSP X) (EQUAL X NIL)), is violated by the arguments
in the call (CAR 3).  (Backtrace is below.)<p>

1&gt; (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::BAR 3)
  2&gt; (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO 3)<p>

ACL2 !&gt;(wet (bar 3) :fns (foo))<p>

<p>

ACL2 Error in WITH-ERROR-TRACE:  The guard for the function symbol
CAR, which is (OR (CONSP X) (EQUAL X NIL)), is violated by the arguments
in the call (CAR 3).  (Backtrace is below.)<p>

1&gt; (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO 3)<p>

ACL2 !&gt;
</pre>

Notice that because guards were not verified, the so-called
<a href="EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> functions are evaluated for <code>foo</code> and
<code>bar</code>.  These can be identified with package names beginning with the
string "ACL2_*1*_".<p>

See <a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a> for a general tracing utility.<p>

NOTES:<p>

1. Recursive calls of <a href="EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> functions will not
generally be traced.<p>

2. In the (probably rare) event of a hard Lisp error, you will have to exit
the Lisp break before seeing the backtrace.<p>

3. <code>Wet</code> always untraces all functions before it installs the traces it
needs, and it leaves all functions untraced when it completes.  If existing
functions were traced then you will need to re-execute <code><a href="TRACE$.html">trace$</a></code> in order
to re-install tracing on those functions after <code>wet</code> is called on any form.<p>

4. <code>Wet</code> returns an error triple <code>(mv error-p value state)</code>, where
<code>value</code> is a print representation of the value returned by the form given
to <code>wet</code>.  Presumably <code>value</code> is not particularly important anyhow, as
the intended use of <code>wet</code> is for the case that an error occurred in
evaluation of a form.<p>

5. As mentioned above, functions in the main Lisp package (i.e., those built
into Common Lisp) will not be traced by <code>wet</code>.
