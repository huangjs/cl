<h2>WITH-LOCAL-STOBJ</h2>locally bind a single-threaded object
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="STOBJ.html">STOBJ</a>
</pre><p>

See <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a> for an introduction to single-threaded objects.

<pre>
Example Form:
(with-local-stobj
 st
 (mv-let (result st)
         (compute-with-st x st)
         result))
</pre>

<code>With-local-stobj</code> can be thought of as a macro, where the example
form above expands as follows.

<pre>
(mv-let (result st)
        (let ((st (create-st)))
          (compute-with-st x st))
        (declare (ignore st))
        result)
</pre>

However, ACL2 expects you to use <code>with-local-stobj</code>, not its
expansion.  More precisely, stobj creator functions are not allowed
except (implicitly) via <code>with-local-stobj</code> and in logic-only
situations (like theorems and hints).  Moreover, neither
<code>with-local-stobj</code> nor its expansions are legal when typed directly at
the top-level loop.
<p>

<pre>
General Forms:
(with-local-stobj stobj-name mv-let-form)
(with-local-stobj stobj-name mv-let-form creator-name)
</pre>

where <code>stobj-name</code> is the name of a <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a> other than <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>,
<code>mv-let-form</code> is a call of <code><a href="MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></code>, and if <code>creator-name</code> is supplied
then it should be the  name of the creator function for <code>stobj-name</code>;
see <a href="DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a>.  For the example form above, its expansion would
use <code>creator-name</code>, if supplied, in place of <code>create-st</code>.<p>

<code>With-local-stobj</code> can be useful when a stobj is used to memoize
intermediate results during a computation, yet it is desired not to
make the <code>stobj</code> a formal parameter for the function and its
callers.<p>

ACL2 can reason about these ``local stobjs,'' and in particular
about stobj creator functions.  For technical reasons, ACL2 will not
allow you to enable the <code>:EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART</code> <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> of a stobj
creator function.<p>

Finally, here is a small example concocted ino rder to illustrate that
<code>with-local-stobj</code> calls can be nested.

<pre>
(defstobj st fld1)<p>

(defun foo ()
  (with-local-stobj
   st ; Let us call this the ``outer binding of st''.
   (mv-let (val10 val20 st)
     (let ((st (update-fld1 10 st)))
       ;; At this point the outer binding of st has fld1 = 10.
       (let ((result (with-local-stobj
                      st ; Let us call this the ``inner binding of st''.
                      (mv-let (val st)
                        (let ((st (update-fld1 20 st)))
                          ;; Now fld1 = 20 for the inner binding of st.
                          (mv (fld1 st) st))
                        val))))
         ;; So result has been bound to 20 above, but here we are once again
         ;; looking at the outer binding of st, where fld1 is still 10.
         (mv (fld1 st) result st)))
     (mv val10 val20))))<p>

(thm (equal (foo) (mv 10 20))) ; succeeds
