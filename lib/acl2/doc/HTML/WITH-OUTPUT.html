<h2>WITH-OUTPUT</h2>suppressing or turning on specified output for an event
<pre>Major Section:  <a href="EVENTS.html">EVENTS</a>
</pre><p>


<pre>
Example:
(with-output
   :off summary ; turn off the event summary when evaluating the following:
   (in-theory (disable name)))
<p>
General Form:
(with-output :key1 val1 ... :keyk valk form)
</pre>

where each <code>:keyi</code> is either <code>:off</code> or <code>:on</code> and either <code>vali</code> is
either <code>:all</code> or else a symbol or non-empty list of symbols representing
output types that can be inhibited (see <a href="SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>).  The result
of evaluating the General Form above is to evaluate <code>form</code>, but in an
environment where the current set of inhibited output types is modified: if
<code>:on :all</code> is specified, then all output is turned on except as specified
by <code>:off</code>; else if <code>:off :all</code> is specified, then all output is inhibited
except as specified by <code>:on</code>; and otherwise, the currently-inhibited output
types are reduced as specified by <code>:on</code> and then extended as specified by
<code>:off</code>.<p>

Warning: <code>With-output</code> has no effect in raw Lisp, and hence is disallowed
in function bodies.  However, you can probably get the effect you want as
illustrated below, where <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> must return an error triple
<code>(mv erp val state)</code>; see <a href="LD.html">ld</a>.

<pre>
Examples avoiding with-output, for use in function definitions:<p>

; Inhibit all output:
(state-global-let*
 ((inhibit-output-lst *valid-output-names*))
 &lt;form&gt;)<p>

; Inhibit all warning output:
(state-global-let*
 ((inhibit-output-lst
   (union-eq (f-get-global 'inhibit-output-lst state)
             '(warning warning!))))
 &lt;form&gt;)
