Example Form:
(wormhole t 'interactive-break nil '(value 'hi!))
                             ; Enters a recursive read-eval-print loop
                             ; on a copy of the ``current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>'' and
                             ; returns nil!
<p>
General Form:
(wormhole pseudo-flg name input form
  :current-package    ...  ; known package name
  :ld-skip-proofsp    ...  ; t, nil or 'include-book
  :ld-redefinition-action  ; nil or '(:a . :b)
  :ld-prompt          ...  ; nil, t, or some prompt printer fn
  :ld-keyword-aliases ...  ; an alist pairing keywords to parse info
  :ld-pre-eval-filter ...  ; :all, :query, or some new name
  :ld-pre-eval-print  ...  ; nil, t, or :never
  :ld-post-eval-print ...  ; nil, t, or :command-conventions
  :ld-evisc-tuple     ...  ; nil or '(alist level length hiding-cars)
  :ld-error-triples   ...  ; nil or t
  :ld-error-action    ...  ; :continue, :return, or :error
  :ld-query-control-alist  ; alist supplying default responses
  :ld-verbose         ...) ; nil or t
</pre>

The keyword arguments above are exactly those of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> (see <a href="LD.html">ld</a>)
except that three of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>'s keyword arguments are missing: the three
that specify the channels <code><a href="STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></code>, <code><a href="STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a></code> and <code><a href="PROOFS-CO.html">proofs-co</a></code>.
Essentially <code>wormhole</code> is just a call of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> on the current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> with
the given keyword arguments.  <code>Wormhole</code> always returns <code>nil</code>.  The
<strong>amazing</strong> thing about <code>wormhole</code> is that it calls <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> and interacts with
the user even though <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> is not available as an argument!<p>

<code>Wormhole</code> does this by manufacturing a ``wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a>,'' a copy of
the ``current <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' (whatever that is) modified so as to contain
some of the wormhole arguments.  <code><a href="LD.html">Ld</a></code> is called on that wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a>
with the three <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> channels directed to ACL2's ``comment window.'' At
the moment, the comment window is overlaid on the terminal and you
cannot tell when output is going to <code><a href="_star_STANDARD-CO_star_.html">*standard-co*</a></code> and when it is
going to the comment window.  But we imagine that eventually a
different window will pop up on your screen.  In any case, the
interaction provided by this call of <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> does not modify the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>
``from which'' wormhole was called, it modifies the copied <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.
When <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> exits (e.g., in response to <code>:</code><code><a href="Q.html">q</a></code> being typed in the comment
window) the wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a> evaporates and <code>wormhole</code> returns <code>nil</code>.
Logically and actually (from the perspective of the ongoing
computation) nothing has happened except that a ``no-op'' function was
called and returned <code>nil</code>.<p>

The name <code>wormhole</code> is meant to suggest the idea that the function
provides easy access to <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> in situations where it is apparently
impossible to get <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  Thus, for example, if you define the
<code>factorial</code> function, say, except that you sprinkled into its body
appropriate calls of <code>wormhole</code>, then the execution of <code>(factorial 6)</code>
would cause interactive breaks in the comment window.  During those
breaks you would apparently be able to inspect the ``current <a href="STATE.html">state</a>''
even though <code>factorial</code> does not take <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> as an argument.  The whole
notion of there being a ``current <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' during the evaluation of
<code>(factorial 6)</code> is logically ill-defined.  And yet, we know from
practical experience with the sequential computing machines upon
which ACL2 is implemented that there is a ``current <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' (to
which the <code>factorial</code> function is entirely insensitive) and that is
the <a href="STATE.html">state</a> to which <code>wormhole</code> ``tunnels.'' A call of <code>wormhole</code> from
within <code>factorial</code> can pass <code>factorial</code>-specific information that is
embedded in the wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a> and made available for inspection by
the user in an interactive setting.  But no information ever flows
out of a wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a>: <code>wormhole</code> always returns <code>nil</code>.<p>

There are some restrictions about what can be done inside a wormhole.  As you
may imagine, we really do not ``copy the current state'' but rather just keep
track of how we modified it and undo those modifications upon exit.  An error is
signalled if you try to modify <code>state</code> in an unsupported way.  For this same
reason, wormholes do not allow updating of any user-defined single-threaded
objects.  See <a href="STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.<p>

There are four arguments to <code>wormhole</code> that need further explanation:
<code>pseudo-flg</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>form</code>.  Roughly speaking, the value of
<code>pseudo-flg</code> should be <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> and indicates whether we are actually
to enter a wormhole or just return <code>nil</code> immediately.  The actual
handling of <code>pseudo-flg</code> is more sophisticated and is explained in
detail at the end of this <a href="DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.<p>

<code>Name</code> and <code>input</code> are used as follows.  Recall that <code>wormhole</code> copies the
``current <a href="STATE.html">state</a>'' and then modifies it slightly to obtain the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>
upon which <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> is called.  We now describe the modifications.  First,
the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> global variable <code>'wormhole-name</code> is set to <code>name</code>, which may
be any non-<code>nil</code> ACL2 object but is usually a symbol.  Then,
<code>'wormhole-input</code> is set to <code>input</code>, which may be any ACL2 object.
Finally, and inexplicably, <code>'wormhole-output</code> is set to the value of
<code>'wormhole-output</code> the last time a wormhole named <code>name</code> was exited (or
<code>nil</code> if this is the first time a wormhole named <code>name</code> was entered).
This last aspect of wormholes, namely the preservation of
<code>'wormhole-output</code>, allows all the wormholes of a given name to
communicate with each other.<p>

We can now explain how <code>form</code> is used.  The modified <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> described
above is the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> on which <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> is called.  However, <code><a href="STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></code> --
the input channel from which <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> reads <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s -- is set so that the
first <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a> that <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> reads and evaluates is <code>form</code>.  If <code>form</code> returns
an error triple with value <code>:</code><code><a href="Q.html">q</a></code>, i.e., <code>form</code> returns via <code>(value :q)</code>,
then no further <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s are read, <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> exits, and the wormhole exits
and returns <code>nil</code>.  But if <code>form</code> returns any other value (or is not an
error triple), then subsequent <a href="COMMAND.html">command</a>s are read from the comment
window.<p>

As usual, the <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>-specials affect whether a herald is printed upon
entry, whether <code>form</code> is printed before evaluation, whether a <a href="PROMPT.html">prompt</a>
is printed, how errors are handled, etc.  The <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>-specials can be
specified with the corresponding arguments to <code>wormhole</code>.  It is
standard practice to call <code>wormhole</code> so that the entry to <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> and the
evaluation of <code>form</code> are totally silent.  Then, tests in <code>form</code> can
inspect the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> and decide whether user interaction is desired.
If so, <code>form</code> can appropriately set <code><a href="LD-PROMPT.html">ld-prompt</a></code>, <code><a href="LD-ERROR-ACTION.html">ld-error-action</a></code>, etc.,
print a herald, and then return <code>(value :invisible)</code>.  Recall
(see <a href="LD.html">ld</a>) that <code>(value :invisible)</code> causes <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code> not to print a value
for the just executed form.  The result of this arrangement is that
whether interaction occurs can be based on tests that are performed
on the wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a> after <code>(@ wormhole-input)</code> and the last
<code>(@ wormhole-output)</code> are available for inspection.  This is
important because outside the wormhole you can access
<code>wormhole-input</code> (you are passing it into the wormhole) but you may
not be able to access the current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> (because you might be in
<code>factorial</code>) and you definitely cannot access the <code>wormhole-output</code> of
the last wormhole because it is not part of the ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  Thus,
if the condition under which you wish to interact depends upon the
<code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> or that part of it preserved from the last wormhole
interaction, that condition can only be tested from within the
wormhole, via <code>form</code>.<p>

It is via this mechanism that <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code> (see <a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>)
is implemented.  To be more precise, the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s is
maintained as part of the preserved <code>wormhole-output</code> of the
<code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code> wormhole.  Because it is not part of the normal <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>,
it may be changed by the user during proofs.  That is what allows
you to install new <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>s while debugging proofs.  But that means
that the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s cannot be inspected from outside
the wormhole.  Therefore, to decide whether a break is to occur when
a given rule is applied, the rewriter must enter the <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code>
wormhole, supplying a form that causes interaction if the given
rule's break condition is satisfied.  The user perceives this as
though the wormhole was conditionally entered -- a perception that
is happily at odds with the informed user's knowledge that the list
of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s is not part of the <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  In fact, the wormhole
was unconditionally entered and the condition was checked from
within the wormhole, that being the only <a href="STATE.html">state</a> in which the
condition is known.<p>

Another illustrative example is available in the implemention of the
<code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code> command.  How can we add a new <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> to the list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed
<a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s while in the normal ACL2 <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> (i.e., while not in a
wormhole)?  The answer is: by getting into a wormhole.  In
particular, when you type <code>(monitor rune expr)</code> at the top-level of
ACL2, <code><a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a></code> enters the <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code> wormhole with a cleverly
designed first <code>form</code>.  That form adds <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> and <code>expr</code> to the list of
<a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s -- said list only being available in <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code>
wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a>s.  Then the first form returns <code>(value :q)</code>, which
causes us to exit the wormhole.  By using <code><a href="LD.html">ld</a></code>-specials that
completely suppress all output during the process, it does not
appear to the user that a wormhole was entered.  The moral here is
rather subtle: the first form supplied to <code>wormhole</code> may be the entire
computation you want to perform in the wormhole; it need not just be
a predicate that decides if interaction is to occur.  Using
wormholes of different names you can maintain a variety of
``hidden'' data structures that are always accessible (whether
passed in or not).  This appears to violate completely the
applicative semantics of ACL2, but it does not: because these data
structures are only accessible via <code>wormhole</code>s, it is impossible for
them to affect any ACL2 computation (except in the comment window).<p>

As one might imagine, there is some overhead associated with
entering a wormhole because of the need to copy the current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.
This brings us back to <code>pseudo-flg</code>.  Ostensibly, <code>wormhole</code> is a
function and hence all of its argument expressions are evaluated
outside the function (and hence, outside the wormhole it creates)
and then their values are passed into the function where an
appropriate wormhole is created.  In fact, <code>wormhole</code> is a macro that
permits the <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression to peer dimly into the wormhole
that will be created before it is created.  In particular,
<code>pseudo-flg</code> allows the user to access the <code>wormhole-output</code> that will
be used to create the wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a>.<p>

This is done by allowing the user to mention the (apparently
unbound) variable <code>wormhole-output</code> in the first argument to <code>wormhole</code>.
Logically, <code>wormhole</code> is a macro that wraps

<pre>
(let ((wormhole-output nil)) ...)
</pre>

around the expression supplied as its first argument.  So logically,
<code>wormhole-output</code> is always <code>nil</code> when the expression is
evaluated.  However, actually, <code>wormhole-output</code> is bound to the
value of <code>(@ wormhole-output)</code> on the last exit from a wormhole of
the given name (or <code>nil</code> if this is the first entrance).  Thus, the
<code>pseudo-flg</code> expression, while having to handle the possibility
that <code>wormhole-output</code> is <code>nil</code>, will sometimes see non-<code>nil</code>
values.  The next question is, of course, ``But how can you get away
with saying that logically <code>wormhole-output</code> is always <code>nil</code> but
actually it is not?  That doesn't appear to be sound.'' But it is
sound because whether <code>pseudo-flg</code> evaluates to <code>nil</code> or
non-<code>nil</code> doesn't matter, since in either case <code>wormhole</code> returns
<code>nil</code>.  To make that point slightly more formal, imagine that
<code>wormhole</code> did not take <code>pseudo-flg</code> as an argument.  Then it
could be implemented by writing

<pre>
(if pseudo-flg (wormhole name input form ...) nil).
</pre>

Now since wormhole always returns <code>nil</code>, this expression is
equivalent to <code>(if pseudo-flg nil nil)</code> and we see that the value
of <code>pseudo-flg</code> is irrelevant.  So we could in fact allow the user
to access arbitrary information to decide which branch of this if to
take.  We allow access to <code>wormhole-output</code> because it is often all
that is needed.  We don't allow access to <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> (unless <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> is
available at the level of the wormhole call) for technical reasons
having to do with the difficulty of overcoming <code>translate</code>'s
prohibition of the sudden appearance of the variable <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.<p>

We conclude with an example of the use of <code>pseudo-flg</code>.  This example
is a simplification of our implementation of <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code>.  To
enter <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code> at the beginning of the attempted application of
a rule, <code>rule</code>, we use

<pre>
(wormhole
 (and (f-get-global 'brr-mode state)
      (member-equal (access rewrite-rule rule :rune)
                    (cdr (assoc-eq 'monitored-runes wormhole-output))))
 'break-rewrite
 ...)
</pre>

The function in which this call of <code>wormhole</code> occurs has <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> as a
formal.  The <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression can therefore refer to <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code> to
determine whether <code>'brr-mode</code> is set.  But the <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression
above mentions the variable <code>wormhole-output</code>; this variable is not
bound in the context of the call of <code>wormhole</code>; if <code>wormhole</code> were a
simple function symbol, this expression would be illegal because it
mentions a free variable.<p>

However, it is useful to think of <code>wormhole</code> as a simple function that
evaluates all of its arguments but to also imagine that somehow
<code>wormhole-output</code> is magically bound around the first argument so that
<code>wormhole-output</code> is the output of the last <code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code> wormhole.
If we so imagine, then the <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression above evaluates
either to <code>nil</code> or non-<code>nil</code> and we will enter the wormhole named
<code><a href="BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></code> in the latter case.<p>

Now what does the <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression above actually test?  We
know the format of our own <code>wormhole-output</code> because we are
responsible for maintaining it.  In particular, we know that the
list of <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s can be obtained via

<pre>
(cdr (assoc-eq 'monitored-runes wormhole-output)).
</pre>

Using that knowledge we can design a <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression which
tests whether (a) we are in <code>brr-mode</code> and (b) the <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a> of the
current rule is a member of the <a href="MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="RUNE.html">rune</a>s.  Question (a) is
answered by looking into the current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  Question (b) is
answered by looking into that part of the about-to-be-created
wormhole <a href="STATE.html">state</a> that will differ from the current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>.  To
reiterate the reason we can make <code>wormhole-output</code> available here
even though it is not in the current <code><a href="STATE.html">state</a></code>: logically speaking the
value of <code>wormhole-output</code> is irrelevant because it is only used to
choose between two identical alternatives.  This example also makes
it clear that <code>pseudo-flg</code> provides no additional functionality.
The test made in the <code>pseudo-flg</code> expression could be moved into
the first form evaluated by the wormhole -- changing the free
variable <code>wormhole-output</code> to <code>(@ wormhole-output)</code> and arranging
for the first form to return <code>(value :q)</code> when the <code>pseudo-flg</code>
expression returns <code>nil</code>.  The only reason we provide the
<code>pseudo-flg</code> feature is because it allows the test to be carried
out without the overhead of entering the wormhole.<p>

Wormholes can be used not only in <code>:</code><code><a href="PROGRAM.html">program</a></code> mode definitions but also
in <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> mode definitions.  Thus, it is possible (though somewhat
cumbersome without investing in macro support) to annotate logical
functions with output facilities that do not require <code>state</code>.  These
facilities do not complicate proof obligations.  Suppose then that
one doctored a simple function, e.g., APP, so as to do some printing
and then proved that APP is associative.  The proof may generate
extraneous output due to the doctoring.  Furthermore, contrary to
the theorem proved, execution of the function appears to affect
*standard-co*.  To see what the function ``really'' does when
evaluated, enter raw lisp and set the global variable
*inhibit-wormhole-activityp* to t.
