<h2>What Is ACL2?</h2>
<p>
ACL2 is a <b>mathematical logic</B> together with a
<b>mechanical theorem prover</B>  to help you reason in the logic.<p>

The logic is just a subset of applicative <a href="Common_Lisp.html">Common Lisp</a>.<p>

The theorem prover is an ``industrial strength'' version of the Boyer-Moore
theorem prover, Nqthm.<p>

<b>Models</B> of all kinds of computing systems can be built in ACL2, just as
in Nqthm, even though the formal logic is Lisp.<p>

Once you've built an ACL2 model of a system, you can run it.<p>

You can also use ACL2 to prove theorems about the model.<p>
