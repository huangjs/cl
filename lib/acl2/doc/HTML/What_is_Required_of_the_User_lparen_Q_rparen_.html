<h2>What is Required of the User?</h2>
<p>
It is not easy to build ACL2 models of complex systems.  To do so, the
user must <b>understand</B>

<pre>
  * the system being modeled, and<p>

  * ACL2, at least as a programming language.
</pre>
<p>

It is not easy to get ACL2 to prove hard theorems.  To do so, the user must
<b>understand</B>

<pre>
  * the model,<p>

  * ACL2 as a mathematical logic, and<p>

  * be able to construct a proof (in interaction with ACL2).
</pre>

ACL2 will help construct the proof but its primary role is to prevent
logical mistakes.  The creative burden -- the mathematical insight into
<b>why the model has the desired property</B> -- is the user's responsibility.<p>
