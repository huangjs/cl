<h2>What is a Mechanical Theorem Prover?</h2>
<p>
A <b>mechanical theorem prover</B> is a computer program that finds
proofs of theorems.<p>

The ideal mechanical theorem prover is <b>automatic</B>:  you give
it a formula and it gives you a proof of that formula or tells you
there is no proof.<p>

Unfortunately, automatic theorem provers can be built only for very
simple logics (e.g., <b>propositional calculus</B>) and even then
practical considerations (e.g., how many
centuries you are willing to wait) limit the problems they can solve.<p>
