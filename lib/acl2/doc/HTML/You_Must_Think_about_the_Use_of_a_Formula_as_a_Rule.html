<h2>You Must Think about the Use of a Formula as a Rule</h2>
<p>
This is <b>good</B> and <b>bad</B>.<p>

The good news is that you can <b>program</B> ACL2's simplifier.<p>

The bad news is that when you command ACL2 to prove a theorem you must
give some thought to <b>how that theorem is to be used as a rule</B>!<p>

For example, if you engaged in the mathematically trivial act of proving
the associativity rule again, but with the equality reversed, you
would have programmed ACL2's rewriter to loop forever.<p>

You can avoid adding any rule by using the command:

<pre>
(defthm associativity-of-app
  (equal (app (app a b) c)
         (app a (app b c)))
  <b>:rule-classes nil</B>)
</pre>
