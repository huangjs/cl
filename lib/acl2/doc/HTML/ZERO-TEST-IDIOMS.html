<h2>ZERO-TEST-IDIOMS</h2>how to test for 0

</pre><p>

Below are six commonly used idioms for testing whether <code>x</code> is <code>0</code>.
<code><a href="ZIP.html">Zip</a></code> and <code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code> are the preferred termination tests for recursions
down the integers and naturals, respectively.

*See <a href="GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>, especially the subsection titled
``Guards and evaluation V: efficiency issues''.  Primary code is
relevant only if <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s are verified.  The ``compiled code'' shown
is only suggestive.
<p>
The first four idioms all have the same logical meaning and differ
only with respect to their executability and efficiency.  In the
absence of compiler optimizing, <code>(= x 0)</code> is probably the most
efficient, <code>(equal x 0)</code> is probably the least efficient, and
<code>(eql x 0)</code> is in between.  However, an optimizing compiler could
always choose to compile <code>(equal x 0)</code> as <code>(eql x 0)</code> and, in
situations where <code>x</code> is known at compile-time to be numeric,
<code>(eql x 0)</code> as <code>(= x 0)</code>.  So efficiency considerations must, of
course, be made in the context of the host compiler.<p>

Note also that <code>(zerop x)</code> and <code>(= x 0)</code> are indistinguishable.
They have the same meaning and the same <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, and can reasonably be
expected to generate equally efficient code.<p>

Note that <code>(zip x)</code> and <code>(zp x)</code> do not have the same logical
meanings as the others or each other.  They are not simple tests for
equality to <code>0</code>.  They each coerce <code>x</code> into a restricted domain,
<code><a href="ZIP.html">zip</a></code> to the integers and <code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code> to the natural numbers, choosing
<code>0</code> for <code>x</code> when <code>x</code> is outside the domain.  Thus, <code>1/2</code>, <code>#c(1 3)</code>,
and <code>'abc</code>, for example, are all ``recognized'' as zero by both
<code><a href="ZIP.html">zip</a></code> and <code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code>.  But <code><a href="ZIP.html">zip</a></code> reports that <code>-1</code> is different from
<code>0</code> while <code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code> reports that <code>-1</code> ``is'' <code>0</code>.  More precisely,
<code>(zip -1)</code> is <code>nil</code> while <code>(zp -1)</code> is <code>t</code>.<p>

Note that the last five idioms all have <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s that restrict their
Common Lisp executability.  If these last five are used in
situations in which <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s are to be verified, then proof
obligations are incurred as the price of using them.  If guard
verification is not involved in your project, then the first five
can be thought of as synonymous.<p>

<code><a href="ZIP.html">Zip</a></code> and <code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code> are not provided by Common Lisp but are
ACL2-specific functions.  Why does ACL2 provide these functions?
The answer has to do with the admission of recursively defined
functions and efficiency.  <code><a href="ZP.html">Zp</a></code> is provided as the zero-test in
situations where the controlling formal parameter is understood to
be a natural number.  <code><a href="ZIP.html">Zip</a></code> is analogously provided for the integer
case.  We illustrate below.<p>

Here is an admissible definition of factorial

<pre>
(defun fact (n) (if (zp n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n)))))
</pre>

Observe the classic recursion scheme: a test against <code>0</code> and recursion
by <code><a href="1-.html">1-</a></code>.  Note however that the test against <code>0</code> is expressed with the
<code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code> idiom.  Note also the absence of a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> making explicit our
intention that <code>n</code> is a natural number.<p>

This definition of factorial is readily admitted because when <code>(zp n)</code><p>

is false (i.e., <code>nil</code>) then <code>n</code> is a natural number other than
<code>0</code> and so <code>(1- n)</code> is less than <code>n</code>.  The base case, where <code>(zp n)</code>
is true, handles all the ``unexpected'' inputs, such as arise with
<code>(fact -1)</code> and <code>(fact 'abc)</code>.  When calls of <code>fact</code> are
evaluated, <code>(zp n)</code> checks <code>(integerp n)</code> and <code>(&gt; n 0)</code>.  <a href="GUARD.html">Guard</a>
verification is unsuccessful for this definition of <code>fact</code> because
<code><a href="ZP.html">zp</a></code> requires its argument to be a natural number and there is no
<a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> on <code>fact</code>, above.  Thus the primary raw lisp for <code>fact</code> is
inaccessible and only the <code>:</code><code><a href="LOGIC.html">logic</a></code> definition (which does runtime
``type'' checking) is used in computation.  In summary, this
definition of factorial is easily admitted and easily manipulated by
the prover but is not executed as efficiently as it could be.<p>

Runtime efficiency can be improved by adding a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> to the definition.

<pre>
(defun fact (n)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (integerp n) (&gt;= n 0))))
  (if (zp n) 1 (* n (fact (1- n)))))
</pre>

This <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>ed definition has the same termination conditions as
before -- termination is not sensitive to the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>.  But the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>s
can be verified.  This makes the primary raw lisp definition
accessible during execution.  In that definition, the <code>(zp n)</code> above
is compiled as <code>(= n 0)</code>, because <code>n</code> will always be a natural number
when the primary code is executed.  Thus, by adding a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> and
verifying it, the elegant and easily used definition of factorial is
also efficiently executed on natural numbers.<p>

Now let us consider an alternative definition of factorial in which
<code>(= n 0)</code> is used in place of <code>(zp n)</code>.

<pre>
(defun fact (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (1- n)))))
</pre>

This definition does not terminate.  For example <code>(fact -1)</code> gives
rise to a call of <code>(fact -2)</code>, etc.  Hence, this alternative is
inadmissible.  A plausible response is the addition of a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>
restricting <code>n</code> to the naturals:

<pre>
(defun fact (n)
 (declare (xargs :guard (and (integerp n) (&gt;= n 0))))
 (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (1- n)))))
</pre>

But because the termination argument is not sensitive to the <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>,
it is still impossible to admit this definition.  To influence the
termination argument one must change the conditions tested.  Adding
a runtime test that <code>n</code> is a natural number would suffice and allow
both admission and <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> verification.  But such a test would slow
down the execution of the compiled function.<p>

The use of <code>(zp n)</code> as the test avoids this dilemma.  <code><a href="ZP.html">Zp</a></code>
provides the logical equivalent of a runtime test that <code>n</code> is a
natural number but the execution efficiency of a direct <code><a href="=.html">=</a></code>
comparison with <code>0</code>, at the expense of a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> conjecture to prove.
In addition, if <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> verification and most-efficient execution are
not needed, then the use of <code>(zp n)</code> allows the admission of the
function without a <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a> or other extraneous verbiage.<p>

While general rules are made to be broken, it is probably a good
idea to get into the habit of using <code>(zp n)</code> as your terminating
``<code>0</code> test'' idiom when recursing down the natural numbers.  It
provides the logical power of testing that <code>n</code> is a non-<code>0</code>
natural number and allows efficient execution.<p>

We now turn to the analogous function, <code><a href="ZIP.html">zip</a></code>.  <code><a href="ZIP.html">Zip</a></code> is the
preferred <code>0</code>-test idiom when recursing through the integers toward
<code>0</code>.  <code><a href="ZIP.html">Zip</a></code> considers any non-integer to be <code>0</code> and otherwise
just recognizes <code>0</code>.  A typical use of <code><a href="ZIP.html">zip</a></code> is in the definition
of <code><a href="INTEGER-LENGTH.html">integer-length</a></code>, shown below.  (ACL2 can actually accept this
definition, but only after appropriate lemmas have been proved.)

<pre>
(defun integer-length (i)
  (declare (xargs :guard (integerp i)))
  (if (zip i)
      0
    (if (= i -1)
      0
      (+ 1 (integer-length (floor i 2))))))
</pre>

Observe that the function recurses by <code>(floor i 2)</code>.  Hence,
calling the function on <code>25</code> causes calls on <code>12</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>3</code>,
<code>1</code>, and <code>0</code>, while calling it on <code>-25</code> generates calls on
<code>-13</code>, <code>-7</code>, <code>-4</code>, <code>-2</code>, and <code>-1</code>.  By making <code>(zip i)</code> the
first test, we terminate the recursion immediately on non-integers.
The <a href="GUARD.html">guard</a>, if present, can be verified and allows the primary raw
lisp definition to check <code>(= i 0)</code> as the first terminating
condition (because the primary code is executed only on integers).
