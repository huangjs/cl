# It is our convention to keep the .fig and .gif files in acl2/graphics/
# (note version independence).  As part of this creation, we copy the *.gif
# files from that source to the doc/HTML subdirectory where they will
# reside for convenient HTML access.  We delete the copies on doc/HTML
# every time we rebuild, because the definitive copies are on acl2/graphics/.

rm -f doc/HTML/*.gif

# The next two non-blank lines should be commented out if we don't want to
# destroy the preceding version.
