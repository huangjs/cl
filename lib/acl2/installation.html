ACL2 Version 3.1 Copyright (C) 2006 University of Texas at Austin.  ACL2
is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  See <A
HREF="#License-and-Copyright">below</A> for details.
<P>
ACL2 works on Unix/Linux, Macintosh, and some Windows operating systems (at
least including Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows XP).  It can be built on
top of any of the following Common Lisps:

</ul>

<H3><A NAME="Obtaining-Lisp">Obtaining Common Lisp</A></H3>

ACL2 runs on top of most or all of the major Common Lisp implementations.
These are enumerated below, with links.  Often we put timing comparisons
between different lisps in the <a href="new.html">ACL2 News</a>.

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-GCL">Obtaining GCL</A></B><P>

Gnu Common Lisp (GCL) has probably been the most commonly-used platform for
ACL2, certainly among non-commercial Lisps.  IMPORTANT: Here we are referring
to the non-ANSI version (sometimes called the "CLtL1 version") of GCL.  It
is probably impossible to build ACL2 with ANSI GCL as of December 2005, but
recent GCL advances suggest that this may be possible soon.

<P>

<B>Debian package.</B> You do not need to fetch GCL if you <A
HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download the binary Debian
package for ACL2</A>.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for maintaining this package.

<P>

GCL may be fetched from <code><a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/</a></code>.
If that site goes down, you may be able to find useful information from the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~camm/gcl/">GCL Temporary Distribution Site</a>.

GCL maintainer Camm Maguire suggests the following, in order of preference
(most to least):

<ol>
<li>apt-get -q install gcl gcl-doc if running Debian
<li>Download and install the prebuilt binaries otherwise (if available for your platform)
<li>Download the latest (stable) source tarball and build yourself otherwise
<li>Download the latest (stable) cvs branch and build yourself
</ol>

As of December 2005, the latest recommended version is 2.6.7, and the latest
development version is 2.7.0.  But see <A HREF="#gcl-mac">below</A> for
suggestions for building GCL on a Macintosh running OS X.

<p>

You may obtain recent CVS versions by executing the following commands if you
have CVS installed on your system, which will retrieve the latest
development/unstable cvs sources by default.

<pre>
export CVS_RSH=ssh [or, if using csh: setenv CVS_RSH ssh]
cvs -d:ext:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcl co gcl
</pre>

If you happen to know a particular version of GCL that you wish to obtain,
perhaps by following GCL mailing lists, you can replace the commands
above by commands such as the following.

<pre>
export CVS_RSH=ssh [or, if using csh: setenv CVS_RSH ssh]
cvs -d:ext:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcl co -r Version_x_y_z -d gcl-x.y.z gcl
</pre>

<P>

<A NAME="gcl-mac"><B>Macintosh.</B></A> Robert Krug has provided instructions
for building GCL on Mac OS X, which we include here (very slightly modified, in
part with help from Camm Maguire) in case others find them helpful.

<pre>
The normal build process for GCL on Mac OS X assumes that
you have installed fink on your Mac.  (If you do not know
what this is, don't worry; you probably don't have it or
want it.)  Here we give instructions that have worked for
building GCL on OS X without fink.

   A. Obtain recent sources (there is a problem, e.g., with
      gcl-2.6.7).  For example, you can do the following:

      export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl
      cvs -z9 -q co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl

      At some point you may be able to obtain GCL from
      ftp://ftp.gnu/org/, cd gnu, cd gcl, get
      gcl-2.6.8.tar.gz, tar xfz gcl-2.6.8.tar.gz)

   B. Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your PATH; if not, run:
      PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

   C. cd &lt;gcl directory&gt;

   D. You now need to patch file h/powerpc-macosx.defs (this might not be
      necessary starting with GCL 2.6.8):

      Replace the line:
      LIBS := `echo $(LIBS) | sed -e 's/-lncurses/ /'` /sw/lib/libintl.dylib
      With:
      LIBS := `echo $(LIBS) | sed -e 's/-lncurses/ /'` /usr/local/lib/libintl.dylib

   E. Configure and start to build gcl:
      ./configure
      make

   F. Install gcl:
      sudo make install
</pre>

<P><B><A NAME="Obtaining-Allegro">Obtaining Allegro Common Lisp</A></B><P>

Allegro Common Lisp is probably the most commonly-used commercial platform for
ACL2.  You may be able to obtain a trial version from its web site,

<i>Lispworks note.</i>  We initially encountered a problem in getting ACL2 to run
under LIspworks 4.2.0.  The Lispworks folks provided a patch and suggested that
we make the following announcement.
<blockquote>
  Users with LispWorks4.2.7 should ask us at lisp-support@xanalys.com
  for the transform-if-node patch. It will be helpful if they quote
  (Lisp Support Call #11372) when doing so. Also, they must send a bug
  form generated from their LispWorks image: instructions at
  http://www.lispworks.com/support/bug-report.html.

<H2><A NAME="Obtaining">OBTAINING AND INSTALLING ACL2</A></H2>

ACL2 is more than just the executable image.  You should obtain the standard
books and a local copy of the documentation.  Start here and we will take
you through the whole process of obtaining and installing ACL2.

First, create a directory in which to store ACL2 Version 3.1.  We will
call this directory <I>dir</I>.  For example, <I>dir</I> might be
<CODE>/home/jones/acl2/v3-1</CODE>.

<H3>NOTE: If you intend to obtain an incremental release (e.g. 2.9.4 as opposed
to 2.9), please see the <a href="new.html">ACL2 News</a> for instructions.
Otherwise, continue reading here.</H3>

Begin by clicking on one of the following links.

<p>

The sources come with a <CODE>books</CODE> subdirectory (<A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2-sources/books/Readme.html">here</A>
for the latest non-incremental release)
that you may find helpful in your proof development and programming with ACL2.
The following two collections of books are not included with the sources.  You
can extract them in the <CODE>books/</CODE> subdirectory of your ACL2
distribution; see the <A HREF="#Certifying">discussion below on certifying
books</A> for information on using them.

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-debian">Debian GNU Linux</A></B>

<p>

For Linux (especially Debian GNU Linux), you can <A
HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/acl2.html">download the Debian package
for Linux</A>.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for maintaining this package, and for
pointing out that as Debian packages are simply ar and tar archives, they can
be unpacked on any linux system, and who says: If someone is running Debian,
all they want to do is 'apt-get install acl2', doing likewise for any optional
add-on package they wish as well, e.g. emacs, infix, etc.

<p>

<a name="howto-unpack-debs">You</a> can fetch the above package for a linux
system other than Debian and unpack it as follows.  First, connect to the
directory under which you install ACL2 versions and download the
<code>.deb</code> file there.  Then submit these commands (changing
"<code>2.9-7</code>" and "<code>i386</code>" as appropriate).
<pre>
mkdir acl2_2.9-7
cd acl2_2.9-7
mv ../acl2_2.9-7_i386.deb .
ar x acl2_2.9-7_i386.deb
tar xvfz data.tar.gz
</pre>

This will create subdirectory <code>usr/</code>.  Edit
<code>usr/bin/acl2</code> by replacing "<code>/usr</code>" with the full
pathname for "<code>usr</code>".

<p>

Alternatively, you can use the program <code>alien</code> to convert the
<code>.deb</code> file to <code>.rpm</code> format.  Of course, with the method
shown above or with <code>alien</code>, you will not have the benefit of
package maintenance.

<LI><B><A NAME="Shortcut-windows">Windows Installer</A></B>

<p>

Jared Davis has kindly been providing, typically soon after an ACL2 release, a
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jared/acl2/">Windows installer for ACL2</A>.
The download includes a Unix environment, pre-certified standard and workshop
books, and a copy of Gnu Emacs.

</UL>

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Sources-Unix">Obtaining the Sources: Unix and Linux</A></H3>

For a Unix or Linux system, obtain the sources and place them in directory
<I>dir</I> as follows.

<UL>

<LI>Save <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2.tar.gz">
acl2.tar.gz</A> on directory <I>dir</I>.  (You can run <code>md5sum</code> and
compare with <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2-tar-gz-md5sum">
acl2-tar-gz-md5sum</A> if you wish to verify the transmission.)

<LI>Execute the following four Unix commands.  (<b>Note</b>: Gnu tar is
preferred, as there have been some problems with long file names when using tar
provided by SunOS.  You may want to use the -i option, "<code>tar xpvfi
acl2.tar</code>", if you have problems with other than Gnu tar.  You can see if
you have Gnu tar by running "<code>tar -v</code>".)

<BR><BR>
<CODE>cd <I>dir</I></CODE><BR>
<CODE>gunzip acl2.tar.gz</CODE><BR>
<CODE>tar xpvf acl2.tar</CODE><BR>
<CODE>rm acl2.tar</CODE><BR>

Now proceed to <A HREF="#Create-Image">Creating An Executable Image</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Sources-Non-Unix">Obtaining the Sources: Other than Unix and Linux Systems</A></H3>

For a non-Unix (and non-Linux) system, obtain the sources and place them in
directory <I>dir</I>.  The easiest way to do this is to fetch
file <CODE><A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2.tar.gz">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2.tar.gz</A></CODE>,
and then extract using an appropriate <CODE>tar</CODE> utility.  For example,
for Windows systems you may be able to download a utility such as
<code>djtarnt.exe</code> to be used as follows:
<pre>
djtarnt.exe -x acl2.tar.gz
</pre>
WARNING:  At least one user experienced CR/LF issues when using WinZIP, but we
have received the suggestion that people untarring with that utility should probably
turn off smart cr/lf conversion.

<!-- The following is only for incremental releases. -->
<p>

For a non-incremental release, you may be able to fetch files individually from
directory (and subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, etc., for example as follows:
<CODE><A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2-sources/</A></CODE>.
<!-- End of only for incremental releases. -->

<p>

You will find that the ACL2 distribution
contains many files, subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, etc.  We mean
for you to copy over to your local connected directory the entire
structure of files and subdirectories.  Thus, when you have completed
extracting from <CODE>acl2.tar.gz</CODE>, or fetching all files directly
is done, your local connected directory should have a subdirectory
named <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> under which everything resides.

<P>

Now proceed to <A HREF="#Create-Image">Creating An Executable Image</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Create-Image">Creating An Executable Image</A></H3>

The next step is to create an executable image.  The common approach is to
build that image from the sources you have already obtained.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
However, you may
be able to <A HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">take a short cut by downloading an
ACL2 image</A>, in which case you can skip ahead to <A HREF="#Summary">Summary of
Distribution</A>.  Otherwise you should click on one of the links just below.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Choose the last option if you are using a Common Lisp on which you cannot save
an image (e.g., a trial version of Allegro Common Lisp).

<P>
PLEASE NOTE: The available memory for ACL2 is determined by the underlying
Common Lisp executable.  If you need more memory, refer to your Common Lisp's
instructions for building an executable.

<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
If you downloaded a <A

where <I>xxx</I> is the command to run your local Common Lisp.
<P>
By default, if no <CODE>LISP=</CODE><I>xxx</I> is specified,
<CODE>LISP=gcl</CODE> is used.  On our hosts, <CODE>gcl</CODE> is the name of
GNU Common Lisp, which can be obtained as explained <a
href="#Obtaining-GCL">above</a>.

<P>

This will create executable <code>saved_acl2</code> in the
<code>acl2-sources</code> directory.

<P>

The time taken to carry out this process depends on the host processor but may
be only a few minutes for a fast processor.  The size of the resulting binary
image is dependent on which Lisp was used, but it may be in the vicinity of 17
megabytes.

<P>
This <CODE>make</CODE> works for the Common Lisps listed in <A

<H4><A NAME="Non-Unix">Building an Executable Image on Other than Unix and Linux Systems</A></H4>

Next we describe how to create a suitable binary image containing ACL2.  If you
are using a <B>trial version</B> of Allegro Common Lisp, then you may not be
able to save an image.  In that case, skip to <A href="#Running">Running
Without Building an Executable Image</A>.

<P>

See also <a href="#Build-Particular">Building an Executable Image on Some Particular
Systems</a>, in case you want to skip directly to the instructions in one of
its subtopics.

<P>

Otherwise, proceed as follows.

<P>

Your Common Lisp should be one of those listed in
<A HREF="#Requirements">Requirements</A> above.  Filenames
below should default to the <I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources</CODE>
directory, e.g., for GCL, connect to
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources</CODE> before invoking GCL or, after
entering GCL, do <CODE>(si::chdir
"</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/")</CODE>.

<OL>
<P><LI> Remove file <CODE>nsaved_acl2</CODE> if it exists.

<P><LI> Start up Common Lisp in the <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> directory
and submit the following sequence of commands.

<PRE>
  ; Compile
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (compile-acl2)
</PRE>

  The commands above will compile the ACL2 sources and create compiled object
  files on your <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> subdirectory.

<P><LI> Now exit your Common Lisp and invoke a fresh copy of it (mainly to avoid
  saving an image with the garbage created by the compilation process). Again
  arrange to connect to the <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> subdirectory. In the
  fresh Lisp <a name="initialization-first-pass">type</a>:

<PRE>
  ; Initialization, first pass
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (load-acl2)
  (initialize-acl2)
</PRE>

  This will load the new object files in the Lisp image and bootstrap ACL2 by
  reading and processing the source files. But the attempt at initialization
  will end in an error saying that it is impossible to finish because a certain
  file was compiled during the processing, thus dirtying the image yet again.
  (If however the attempt ends with an error during compilation of file
  <code>TMP1.lisp</code>, see the first troubleshooting tip <a
  href="#troubleshooting-TMP1">below</a>.)

<P><LI> So now exit your Common Lisp and invoke a fresh copy of it (again arranging
  to connect to your <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> subdirectory). Then, in the
  fresh Lisp type:

<PRE>
  ; Initialization, second pass
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (save-acl2 (quote (initialize-acl2))
             "saved_acl2")
</PRE>

  You have now saved an image.  Exit Lisp now.  Subsequent steps will put the
  image in the right place.

<P><LI> Remove <CODE>osaved_acl2</CODE> if it exists.

<P><LI> <b>IF</b> <CODE>saved_acl2</CODE> and <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE> both exist <b>THEN</b>:
<ul>
     <li>move <CODE>saved_acl2.dxl</CODE> to <CODE>osaved_acl2.dxl</CODE>

Or, you may be able to <a href="#Pre-Built-Images">download a pre-built ACL2 image</a>
for GCL/Windows instead of reading this section.
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->

<hr>

Otherwise here are steps to follow.

<ol>
<li><b>FIRST</b> get GCL running on your Windows system using <b>ONE</b> of the
following two options.  Note that GCL can be unhappy with spaces in filenames,
so you should probably save the GCL distribution to a directory whose path is
free of spaces.

<ul>
<li><b>OR</b>, obtain GCL for Windows systems from <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/</a></code>
or as explained <a href="#Obtaining-GCL">above</a>.  You
may wish to pick a <code>.zip</code> file from the <code>cvs/</code>
subdirectory (containing pre-releases) that has "<code>mingw32</code>" in the
name.

<li><b>OR ELSE</b>, perhaps you can build GCL on your Windows system from the
sources.  The mingw tools and the cygnus bash shell have been used to build
distributed GCL executables.

</ul>

<li><b>SECOND</b>, create an appropriate GCL batch file.  When we tried running
the script <code>gclm/bin/gclm.bat</code> that came with
<code>gcl-cvs-20021014-mingw32</code> from the above ftp site, a separate
window popped up, and with an error.  Many ACL2 users prefer running in an
emacs shell buffer.  (We obtained emacs for Windows from <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.2/emacs-21.2-fullbin-i386.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/21.2/emacs-21.2-fullbin-i386.tar.gz</a></code>.)
The following modification of <code>gclm.bat</code> seemed to solve the problem
(your pathnames may vary).
<pre>
@
% do not delete this line %
@ECHO off
set cwd=%cd%
path C:\gcl\gclm\mingw\bin;%PATH%
C:\gcl\gclm\lib\gcl-2.6.1\unixport\saved_gcl.exe -dir C:/gcl/gclm/lib/gcl-2.6.1/unixport/ -libdir  C:/gcl/gclm/lib/gcl-2.6.1/ -eval "(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)" %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</pre>

<li><b>THIRD</b>, follow the <A HREF="#Non-Unix">instructions for non-Unix/Linux
systems</A> above, though the resulting file may be called
<code>saved_acl2.exe</code> rather than <code>saved_acl2</code>.

<!-- NOTE to developers: v3-1 below indicates a normal release, which is OK. -->
<!-- Do not edit that for incremental releases. -->

<li><b>FINALLY</b>, create a file <code>acl2.bat</code> as explained in
<code><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/images/Readme.html#acl2-bat">
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/images/Readme.html</a></code>.

</ol>

<p>

We hope that the above simply works.  If you experience
problems, the following hints may help.

<p>

<b>TROUBLESHOOTING:</b>
<ul>

<li><a name="troubleshooting-TMP1">We</a> tried building ACL2 on Windows XP on
top of GCL, our attempt broke at the end of the "<a
href="#initialization-first-pass">Initialization, first pass</a>" step, while
compiling <code>TMP1.lisp</code>.  That was easily remedied by starting up a
fresh GCL session and invoking <code>(compile-file "TMP1.lisp")</code> before
proceeding to the next step.

<li>Yishai Feldman has provided some nice instructions at <code><a
href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/yishai/reasoning/win-install.htm">http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/yishai/reasoning/win-install.htm</a></code>,
some of which we have tried to incorporate here.  A useful point made there is
that when you want to quit ACL2, use <code>:good-bye</code> (or
<code>(good-bye)</code> which works even in raw Lisp).  Or you can use
<code>(user::bye)</code> in raw Lisp.  The point is:  Avoid <code>control-c
control-d</code>, even thought that often works fine in emacs under
Unix/Linux.

<li>If the above batch file does not work for some reason, an alternate
approach may be to set environment variables.  You may be able to add to the
<code>PATH</code> variable <i>gcl-dir</i><code>\gcc\bin</code>, where
<i>gcl-dir</i> is the directory where GCL is installed.  To get to the place to
set environment variables, you might be able to go to the control panel, under
system, under advanced.  Alternately, you might be able to get there by opening
<code>My Computer</code> and right-clicking to get to <code>Properties</code>,
then selecting the <code>Advanced</code> tab.  At one time, when GCL/Windows
was release as Maxima, Pete Manolios suggested adding the system variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the value "maxima-dir\gcc\i386-mingw32msvc\include"; this
may or may not be necessary for your GCL installation (and the path would of
course likely be different).

</ul>

<H4><A NAME="Windows-GCL-Jared">Instructions from Jared Davis for building ACL2 on
Windows using mingw</A></H4>

We thank Jared Davis for providing the following instructions for Version_2.8,
which we include verbatim and expect apply to future versions.

<pre>
	      Building ACL2 on Windows from Scratch
   _____________________________________________________________

   Note: The disk space requirements are large.  Not including
   emacs, I had about 275 MB taken up by msys/mingw32/gcl/acl2
   during the build process.  You can probably use much less
   space by removing files after you use them, but I didn't
   bother to do that.

   Here are the steps I took:

   Downloaded emacs 21.3 full distribution and installed
   Downloaded msys 1.10.10, installed to c:\acl2
   Downloaded mingw 3.1.0-1, installed to c:\acl2\mingw
   Downloaded gcl 2.5.3, extracted to c:\acl2\mingw
   Downloaded acl2 2.8, extracted to c:\acl2\sources



   Compiling gcl:

     in msys:

       cd /acl2/ming2/gcl-2.5.3
       ./configure
       make
       make install



   Compiling acl2:

     copy "etags.exe" to /mingw/bin.  you can find this program
     in your emacs folder, under "bin".

     in msys:

       cd /sources
       make



   Certifying ACL2 books:
   This took 111 minutes on my Athlon 2500+

     in msys:

       cd /sources

       mv nsaved_acl2.gcl.exe saved_acl2.exe

       vim books/Makefile-generic, remove "nice" from this line:
	   ACL2=time nice ../../saved_acl2

       make certify-books ACL2=/sources/saved_acl2.exe

</pre>

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Running">Running Without Building an Executable Image</A></H3>

The most convenient way to use ACL2 is first to install an executable image as
described above for <A HREF="#Other-Unix">Unix/Linux</A> and <A
HREF="#Non-Unix">other</A> platforms.  However, in some cases this is not
possible, for example if you are using a trial version of Allegro Common Lisp.
In that case you should follow the steps below each time you want to start up
ACL2.

<P>

We assume you have obtained ACL2 and placed it in directory <I>dir</I>, as
described above for <A HREF="#Sources-Unix">Unix/Linux</A> or <A
HREF="#Sources-Non-Unix">other</A> platforms.
<!-- The following is only for non-incremental releases. -->
(If you downloaded a <A
HREF="#Pre-Built-Images">pre-built ACL2 image</A>, then you may skip this section.)
<!-- End of only for non-incremental releases. -->
Connect to subdirectory <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> of <I>dir</I>,
start up your Common Lisp, and compile by executing the following forms.
<I>This sequence of steps need only be performed once.</I>

<PRE>
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (compile-acl2)
</PRE>

Now each time you want to use ACL2, you need only execute the following forms
after starting up Common Lisp in subdirectory <CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> of
<I>dir</I>.

<PRE>
  (load "init.lisp")
  (in-package "ACL2")
  (load-acl2)
  (initialize-acl2)
</PRE>

<I>Note.</I> The resulting process includes the ACL2 documentation, and hence
will probably be considerably larger (perhaps twice the size) than the result
of running an executable image created as described <A
HREF="#Create-Image">above</A>.

<P>

Now proceed to read more about <A HREF="#Using">Using ACL2</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Summary">Summary of Distribution</A></H3>

The distribution includes the following.  A list of all files in
<CODE>acl2-sources</CODE> may be found in the file <CODE>all-files.txt</CODE>
in that directory.
<PRE>
Readme.html; This file

images/    ; Some gzip'd tar'd executables; see images/Readme.html
split/     ; The result of splitting up acl2.tar.gz; see split/Readme.html
</PRE>

<P>
The entire acl2.tar.gz is a little more than 6 megabytes, which expands out to nearly
30 megabytes.  Additional space is required to build an image, perhaps 30 to 120
megabytes depending on the Lisp, and to <A
HREF="#Certifying">certify books</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Saving-Space">Saving Space</A></H3>

For those really pressed for space, we note that it is not necessary
to fetch the whole <CODE>acl2.tar.gz</CODE> file in order to build
acl2.  That file includes more than just the ACL2 sources proper.  It
suffices, for building ACL2, via the instructions above, to fetch only
the <CODE>acl2-sources/*.lisp</CODE> files, which take up `only' about
5 megabytes, together with the file
<CODE>acl2-sources/GNUmakefile</CODE>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="Using">USING ACL2</A></H2>

Here we begin with a discussion of how to <A HREF="#Invoking">invoke ACL2</A>
interactively.  We then discuss <A HREF="#Testing">testing</A> as well as the
<A HREF="#Certifying">certification</A> of ACL2 <em>books</em> that come with
the distribution.  We conclude with a discussion of the <A
HREF="#Documentation">documentation</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Invoking">Invoking ACL2</A></H3>

At this point, <I>dir</I> has a subdirectory called <code>acl2-sources</code>.
The sources and perhaps an executable image are located on that subdirectory.
However, if you have not saved an image but instead use the directions above
for <A HREF="#Running">Running Without Building an Executable Image</A>, skip
to <A HREF="#Starting">When ACL2 Starts Up</A> below.

<P>

The executable image is called <code>acl2-sources/saved_acl2</code>.  You can
invoke ACL2 by running that image, e.g.,

<BR><BR>
<CODE>mycomputer% </CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2</CODE>
<BR><BR>

If on a Unix/Linux system, then to make it easy to invoke ACL2 by typing a
short command, e.g.,

<BR><BR>
<CODE>mycomputer% acl2</CODE>
<BR><BR>

you may want to install an executable file on your path, e.g.,
<code>/usr/local/bin/acl2</code>, containing the following two lines:

<BR><BR>
<CODE>#!/bin/csh -f</CODE><BR>
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2</CODE><BR>
<BR><BR>

Note: A carriage return in the file after the last line above is important!
<P>

<BR>
<H4><A NAME="Starting">When ACL2 Starts Up</A></H4>

When you invoke ACL2, you should see the host Common Lisp 
print a header concerning the ACL2 version, license and copyright.
<P>
Some hosts then automatically enter the ACL2 ``command loop,'' an ACL2
read-eval-print loop with the prompt:
<PRE>
ACL2 !>
</PRE>
Other hosts will leave you in Common Lisp's read-eval-print loop.
If yours is one of the latter, evaluate the Common Lisp expression
<CODE>(ACL2::LP)</CODE> or simply <CODE>(LP)</CODE> if the current
package is <CODE>"ACL2"</CODE>.
<P>
Once in the ACL2 command loop, you can type an ACL2 term, typically
followed by ``return'' or ``enter,'' and ACL2 will evaluate the term,
print its value, and prompt you for another one.  Below are three
simple interactions:
<PRE>
ACL2 !>t
T
ACL2 !>'abc
ABC
ACL2 !>(+ 2 2)
4
</PRE>
<P>

To get out of the ACL2 command loop, type the <code>:q</code> command.
This returns you to the host Common Lisp.  We sometimes call this
``raw Lisp.''  You may re-enter the command loop with
<code>(LP)</code> as above.

<P>
Note that when you are in raw Lisp you can overwrite or destroy ACL2
by executing inappropriate Common Lisp expressions.  <B>All bets are
off once you've exited our loop.</B> That said, many users do it.
For example, you might exit our loop, activate some debugging or trace
features in raw Lisp, and then reenter our loop.  While developing
proofs or tracking down problems, this is reasonable behavior.

<P>
Now you are ready to <A HREF="#Testing">test</A> your image.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Testing">Testing ACL2</A></H3>

<P>
An easy way to test the theorem prover is to
type the following term to the ACL2 command loop:
<PRE>
:mini-proveall
</PRE>
This will cause a moderately long sequence of commands to be processed, each of
which is first printed out as though you had typed it.  Each will print some
text, generally a proof of some conjecture.  None should fail.

<P>
A more elaborate test is to <A NAME="#Certifying">certify the ``books''</A>
that come with the distribution, which is a good idea anyhow; this is our next
topic.  On a Unix/Linux system, you can also certify just a small but useful
subset of the books in a few minutes by executing, in directory
<i>dir</i>/<code>acl2-sources</code>:
<pre>
make certify-books-short
</pre>

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Certifying">Certifying ACL2 Books</A></H3>

<!-- NOTE to developers: v3-1 below indicates a normal release, which is OK. -->
<!-- Do not edit that for incremental releases. -->

The ``books'' that come with the distribution have been contributed mainly by
users and are on the subdirectory <CODE>acl2-sources/books</CODE>.  See <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2-sources/books/Readme.html"><CODE>acl2-sources/books/Readme.html</CODE></A>
for information.  The general topic of books is discussed thoroughly in the
ACL2 documentation; see the <CODE>BOOKS</CODE> node in the documentation tree.

<P>
Books should be ``certified'' before they are used.  We do not distribute
certificates with our books, mainly because certification produces compiled
code specific to the host.  You should certify the books locally as a test of
your ACL2 image.

<P>
It is easy to re-certify all the distributed books in Unix/Linux.  We recommend you
do this.  If you have entered ACL2, exit to the operating system, e.g., by
control-d in many systems.

<P>
While connected to <I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources</CODE>, execute
<PRE>
make certify-books
</PRE>

This will generate minimal output to the screen and will probably take an hour
or two.  Failure is indicated by the presence of <code>**CERTIFICATION FAILED**</code> in the log.

<P>

To remove the files thus created, invoke:
<PRE>
make clean-books
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>certify-books</CODE> target does not cause workshop books to be
certified.  If you want to certify those books as well, you will first need to
<a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-1/distrib/acl2-sources/books/workshops.tar.gz">download
the gzipped tar file</a> to the <CODE>books/</CODE> directory, and then gunzip
and extract it.  You can certify all the books, including books for the
workshops (including those from the 1999 workshop as described in the
(hardbound) book <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-books/acs/index.html"><EM>Computer-Aided
Reasoning: ACL2 Case Studies</EM></A>), using the command:

<PRE>
make regression
</PRE>

<P>
By default, certification uses the image
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2</CODE>.  You may specify any ACL2
image, as long as it is either a command on your Unix/Linux path or an absolute file
name, for example as follows.

<PRE>
make certify-books ACL2=my-acl2

make regression ACL2=/u/smith/projects/acl2/saved_acl2
</PRE>

<P>
We apologize to non-Unix/Linux users: we do not provide non-Unix/Linux
instructions for recertifying the distributed books.  The
certification methods provided by the authors of the books vary
greatly and we codified them in the Unix/Linux makefile (GNUmakefile) used above.  Most
subdirectories of <CODE>acl2-sources/books</CODE> contain either a
<CODE>README</CODE> file or a <CODE>certify.lsp</CODE> file.  Users
who wish to certify one of these books and who cannot figure out (from
these scant clues) what to type to ACL2 should not hesitate to contact
the authors.

<P>
Next proceed to the section on <A HREF="#Documentation">Documentation</A>.

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3><A NAME="Documentation">Documentation</A></H3>

<P>
ACL2's documentation is a hypertext document that, if printed in book
form, is about 1100 pages or more than 2 megabytes of text.  Its
hypertext character makes it far more pleasing to read with an
interactive browser.  The documentation is available in four formats:
HTML, Texinfo, Postscript and ACL2 documentation strings.  All of this
material is copyrighted by the University of Texas at Austin and is
derived under the GNU General Public License from material copyrighted
by Computational Logic, Inc.

<P>
Two Web-based guided tours of ACL2 are available from the home page
noted below.  If you are already familiar with Nqthm, you might find
it useful to look at the documentation node
<CODE>NQTHM-TO-ACL2</CODE>.  Another useful documentation topic for
beginning ACL2 users is the node <CODE>TUTORIAL</CODE>.

<P>
<B>HTML</B>
<P>
The ACL2 Home Page is
<P>
<CODE><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/index.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/index.html</A></CODE>
<P>

The home page provides a selected bibliography, a search button (near the top
of the page), guided tours of the system, and the complete hypertext
documentation tree.

<P>
Once you have installed ACL2, the HTML form of the documentation is
available locally as
<I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/doc/HTML/acl2-doc.html</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
We urge you to browse your local copy of the documentation rather than
our Web copy, simply to reduce Web traffic and the demand on our
server.  (Macintosh users using MacOS 9 and earlier may, however, find
filenames being truncated and hence will want to avoid the local
documentation.)

<P><B>Emacs Info</B><P>

This is a very convenient format for accessing the ACL2 documentation from
within Emacs.  In Emacs, invoke
<PRE>
meta-x info
</PRE>
and then, if you are unfamiliar with Info, type
<PRE>
control-h m
</PRE>
to see a list of commands available.  In particular, type
<BR><BR>
<CODE>g (</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/doc/EMACS/acl2-doc-emacs.info)TOP</CODE><BR><BR>
to enter the ACL2 documentation.  Alternatively, your system administrator can
add an ACL2 node to the top-level Info menu.  The appropriate entry might read:
<BR><BR>
<CODE>* ACL2 i.j: (</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/doc/EMACS/acl2-doc-emacs).</CODE><BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <CODE>Documentation for ACL2 version i.j.</CODE>
<BR><BR>

Note: The Emacs Info and Postscript versions of our documentation were
created using the file <CODE>acl2-sources/doc/texinfo.tex</CODE> which
is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  (See that file
for copyright and license information.)

<P>

Users new to emacs may find it helpful to load into emacs the file
</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/emacs/emacs-acl2.el</CODE>.  Utilities
offered by this file are documented near the top of the file.

<P><B>Postscript</B><P>

The Postscript version of the documentation is not included in our normal
distribution because it is so much less useful than the hyper-text versions.
But a <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-book.ps.gz">gzipped
Postscript (1.2 MB)</A> version is available.  It prints as a book of about 1000
pages and contains a Table of Contents and an index to all documented topics.

<P><B>ACL2 Documentation Strings</B><P>

The ACL2 system has facilities for browsing the documentation.  When you are in
the ACL2 command loop, you may query the documentation on a given topic by
typing the command
<BR><BR>
<CODE>:doc </CODE><I>topic</I>
<BR><BR>
where <I>topic</I> is the Lisp symbol naming the topic you want to
learn about.  To learn more about the on-line documentation, type
<CODE>:help</CODE> and then return.

<P>
Note, however, that you may find it more convenient to view the documentation
in a web browser (starting at <CODE>doc/HTML/acl2-doc.html</CODE>) or in Emacs
info (starting at <CODE>doc/EMACS/acl2-doc-emacs.info</CODE>).

ACL2 supports rational numbers but not real numbers.  However, starting
with Version  2.5, a variant of ACL2 called "ACL2(r)" supports the real
numbers by way of non-standard analysis.  ACL2(r) was conceived and
first implemented by Ruben Gamboa in his Ph.D. dissertation work,
supervised by Bob Boyer with active participation by Matt Kaufmann.
See the documentation topic <CODE>REAL</CODE> for information about this
extension and how to build it, and a warning about its experimental nature.

By default, if no <CODE>LISP=</CODE><I>xxx</I> is specified,
<CODE>LISP=gcl</CODE> is used.  On our hosts, <CODE>gcl</CODE> is the name of
GNU Common Lisp, which can be obtained as explained <a
href="#Obtaining-GCL">above</a>.
<P>
This will create executable <code>saved_acl2r</code> in the
<I>dir</I><code>/acl2-sources</code> directory (notice the trailing
~code>r</code> in the executable filename).

<P>

Finally, to certify books under directory
<I>dir</I>/acl2-sources/books/nonstd/<code> with ACL2(r), stand in the
</CODE><I>dir</I><CODE>/acl2-sources/</CODE> directory and execute the
following command.
<pre>
make regression-nonstd ACL2=<I>dir</I>/acl2-sources/saved_acl2r
</pre>
