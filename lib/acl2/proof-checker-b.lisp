  "evaluate the given form in Lisp~/
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (lisp (assign xxx 3))~/

  General Form:
  (lisp form)
  ~ev[]
  Evaluate ~c[form].  The ~c[lisp] command is mainly of interest for side
  effects.  See also ~c[print], ~c[skip], and ~c[fail].

  The rest of the documentation for ~c[lisp] is of interest only to
  those who use it in macro commands.  If the Lisp evaluation (by
  ~c[trans-eval]) of form returns an ``error triple'' of the form
  ~c[(mv erp ((NIL NIL STATE) . (erp-1 val-1 &)) state)], then the
  ~c[lisp] command returns the appropriate error triple
  ~bv[]
  (mv (or erp erp-1)
      val-1
      state) .
  ~ev[]
  Otherwise, the ~c[trans-eval] of form must return an ``error triple''
  of the form ~c[(mv erp (cons stobjs-out val) &)], and the ~c[lisp]
  command returns the appropriate error triple
  ~bv[]
  (mv erp
      val
      state).
  ~ev[]

  Note that the output signature of the form has been lost.  The user
  must know the signature in order to use the output of the ~c[lisp]
  command.  Trans-eval, which is undocumented except by comments in
  the ACL2 source code, has replaced, in ~c[val], any occurrence of
  the current state or the current values of stobjs by simple symbols
  such as ~c[REPLACED-STATE].  The actual values of these objects may
  be recovered, in principle, from the ~c[state] returned and the
  ~c[user-stobj-alist] within that state.  However, in practice, the
  stobjs cannot be recovered because the user is denied access to
  ~c[user-stobj-alist].  The moral is: do not try to write macro
  commands that manipulate stobjs.  Should the returned ~c[val]
  contain ~c[REPLACED-STATE] the value may simply be ignored and
  ~c[state] used, since that is what ~c[REPLACED-STATE] denotes."

  General Forms:

  exit --  Exit without storing an event.

  (exit event-name &optional rule-classes do-it-flg)
  Exit, and store an event.
  ~ev[]
  The command ~c[exit] returns you to the ACL2 loop.  At a later time,
  ~c[(verify)] may be executed to get back into the same proof-checker
  state, as long as there hasn't been an intervening use of the
  proof-checker (otherwise see ~c[save]).

  When given one or more arguments as shown above, ~c[exit] still returns
  you to the ACL2 loop, but first, if the interactive proof is
  complete, then it attempts create a ~c[defthm] event with the specified
  ~c[event-name] and ~c[rule-classes] (which defaults to ~c[(:rewrite)] if not
  supplied).  The event will be printed to the terminal, and then
  normally the user will be queried whether an event should really be
  created.  However, if the final optional argument ~c[do-it-flg] is
  supplied and not ~c[nil], then an event will be made without a query.

  For example, the form
  ~bv[]
  (exit top-pop-elim (:elim :rewrite) t)
  ~ev[]
  causes a ~c[defthm] event named ~c[top-pop-elim] to be created with
  rule-classes ~c[(:elim :rewrite)], without a query to the user (because
  of the argument ~c[t]).

  ~st[Note:]  it is permitted for ~c[event-name] to be ~c[nil].  In that case, the
  name of the event will be the name supplied during the original call
  of ~c[verify].  (See the documentation for ~c[verify] and ~c[commands].)  Also
  in that case, if ~c[rule-classes] is not supplied then it defaults to
  the rule-classes supplied in the original call of ~c[verify].

  ~c[Comments] on ``success'' and ``failure''.  An ~c[exit] instruction will
  always ``fail'', so for example, if it appears as an argument of a
  ~c[do-strict] instruction then none of the later (instruction) arguments
  will be executed.  Moreover, the ``failure'' will be ``hard'' if an
  event is successfully created or if the instruction is simply ~c[exit];
  otherwise it will be ``soft''.  See the documentation for ~c[sequence]
  for an explanation of hard and soft ``failures''.  An obscure but
  potentially important fact is that if the ``failure'' is hard, then
  the error signal is a special signal that the top-level interactive
  loop can interpret as a request to exit.  Thus for example, a
  sequencing command that turns an error triple ~c[(mv erp val state)]
  into ~c[(mv t val state)] would never cause an exit from the interactive
  loop.

  If the proof is not complete, then ~c[(exit event-name ...)] will not
  cause an exit from the interactive loop.  However, in that case it
  will print out the original user-supplied goal (the one that was
  supplied with the call to ~c[verify]) and the current list of
  instructions."

  Prints out instructions in reverse order.  This is actually the same
  as ~c[(commands n t)] ~-[] or, ~c[(commands nil t)] if ~c[n] is not supplied.  As
  explained in the documentation for ~c[commands], the final argument of ~c[t]
  causes suppression of instructions occurring between so-called
  ``matching bookends,'' which we now explain.

  A ``begin bookend'' is an instruction of the form
  ~bv[]
  (COMMENT :BEGIN x . y).
  ~ev[]
  Similarly, an ``end bookend'' is an instruction of the form
  ~bv[]
  (COMMENT :END x' . y').
  ~ev[]
  The ``name'' of the first bookend is ~c[x] and the ``name'' of the
  second bookend is ~c[x'].  When such a pair of instructions occurs in
  the current state-stack, we call them ``matching bookends'' provided
  that they have the same name (i.e. ~c[x] equals ~c[x']) and if no other
  begin or end bookend with name ~c[x] occurs between them.  The idea now
  is that ~c[comm] hides matching bookends together with the instructions
  they enclose.  Here is a more precise explanation of this
  ``hiding''; probably there is no value in reading on!

  A ~c[comm] instruction hides bookends in the following manner.  (So does
  a ~c[comment] instruction when its second optional argument is supplied
  and non-~c[nil].)  First, if the first argument ~c[n] is supplied and not
  ~c[nil], then we consider only the last ~c[n] instructions from the
  state-stack; otherwise, we consider them all.  Now the resulting
  list of instructions is replaced by the result of applying the
  following process to each pair of matching bookends:  the pair is
  removed, together with everything in between the begin and end
  bookend of the pair, and all this is replaced by the ``instruction''
  ~bv[]
  (\"***HIDING***\" :COMMENT :BEGIN name ...)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[(comment begin name ...)] is the begin bookend of the pair.
  Finally, after applying this process to each pair of matching
  bookends, each begin bookend of the form ~c[(comment begin name ...)]
  that remains is replaced by
  ~bv[]
  (\"***UNFINISHED***\" :COMMENT :BEGIN name ...) .
  ~ev[]"

;; think of abbreviation variables as standing for something else only

;; approach is that we can't tell about the position until we've done
;; the translation (consider macro calls that look at the first
;; character, say, for example).  On a pragmatic (implementation)
;; level, it's hard to see how to implement a translator that
;; substitutes for abbreviation variables only when they're in
;; variable position, except by modifying translate.  On the other
;; hand, for untranslation the specification is only that
;; (trans (untrans x)) = x, where here translation is with respect
;; to abbreviations.  Notice though that this spec messes things
;; up, because if x is (quote &v) then untrans of that is still
;; (quote &v) but then trans would remove the &v, if we use sublis
;; to deal with abbreviations.

;; So, I think I'll implement abbreviations as follows.  There will
;; be a new "macro":

;; (defmacro ? (x)

  ~c[govs-indices] should be lists of indices of hypotheses and governors
  (respectively), except that the atom ~c[t] may be used to indicate that
  one wants all hypotheses or governors (respectively).

  The list of ``governors'' is defined as follows.  Actually, we
  define here the notion of the governors for a pair of the form
  ~c[<term], address>]; we're interested in the special case where the
  term is the conclusion and the address is the current address.  If
  the address is ~c[nil], then there are no governors, i.e., the list of
  governors is ~c[nil].  If the term is of the form ~c[(if x y z)] and the
  address is of the form ~c[(2 . rest)] or ~c[(3 . rest)], then the list of
  governors is the result of ~c[cons]ing ~c[x] or its negation (respectively)
  onto the list of governors for the pair ~c[<y, rest>] or the pair
  ~c[<z, rest>] (respectively).  If the term is of the form ~c[(implies x y)]
  and the address is of the form ~c[(2 . rest)], then the list of
  governors is the result of ~c[cons]ing ~c[x] onto the list of governors for
  the pair ~c[<y, rest>].  Otherwise, the list of governors for the pair
  ~c[<term, (n .  rest)>] is exactly the list of governors for the pair
  ~c[<argn, rest>] where ~c[argn] is the ~c[n]th argument of ~c[term].

  If all goals have been proved, a message saying so will be printed.
  (as there will be no current hypotheses or governors!).

  The ~c[hyps] command never causes an error.  It ``succeeds'' (in fact
  its value is ~c[t]) if the arguments (when supplied) are appropriate,
  i.e.  either ~c[t] or lists of indices of hypotheses or governors,

  ~st[Note:]  The new goals will all have their hypotheses promoted; in

(define-pc-primitive add-abbreviation (var &optional raw-term)

  "add an abbreviation~/

  Example:  ~c[(add-abbreviation v (* x y))] causes future occurrences of
  ~c[(* x y)] to be printed as ~c[(? v)], until (unless) a corresponding
  invocation of ~c[remove-abbreviations] occurs.  In this case we say that
  ~c[v] ``abbreviates'' ~c[(* x y)].~/
  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (add-abbreviation var &optional raw-term)
  ~ev[]
  Let ~c[var] be an abbreviation for ~c[raw-term], if ~c[raw-term] is supplied,
  else for the current subterm.  Note that ~c[var] must be a variable that
  does not already abbreviate some term.

  A way to think of abbreviations is as follows.  Imagine that
  whenever an abbreviation is added, say ~c[v] abbreviates ~c[expr], an entry
  associating ~c[v] to ~c[expr] is made in an association list, which we will
  call ``~c[*abbreviations-alist*]''.  Then simply imagine that ~c[?] is a
  function defined by something like:
  ~bv[]
  (defun ? (v)
    (let ((pair (assoc v *abbreviations-alist*)))
      (if pair (cdr pair)
        (error ...))))
  ~ev[]
  Of course the implementation isn't exactly like that, since the
  ``constant'' ~c[*abbreviations-alist*] actually changes each time an
  ~c[add-abbreviation] instruction is successfully invoked.  Nevertheless,
  if one imagines an appropriate redefinition of the ``constant''
  ~c[*abbreviations-alist*] each time an ~c[add-abbreviation] is invoked, then
  one will have a clear model of the meaning of such an instruction.

  The effect of abbreviations on output is that before printing a
  term, each subterm that is abbreviated by a variable ~c[v] is first
  replaced by ~c[(? v)].

  The effect of abbreviations on input is that every built-in
  proof-checker command accepts abbreviations wherever a term is
  expected as an argument, i.e., accepts the syntax ~c[(? v)] whenever ~c[v]
  abbreviates a term.  For example, the second argument of
  ~c[add-abbreviation] may itself use abbreviations that have been defined
  by previous ~c[add-abbreviation] instructions.

  For example, if the conclusion is ~c[(= x (* (- y) z))] and the
  current subterm is ~c[y], then after executing ~c[top], the current subterm
  will be the same as the conclusion, i.e., ~c[(= x (* (- y) z))].~/

  ~c[Top] is the same as ~c[(up n)], where ~c[n] is the number of times one needs

                       needs to be maintained at each occurrence of x~/

  General form:
  (equiv old new &optional relation)
  ~ev[]
  Substitute new for old everywhere inside the current subterm,
  provided that either (relation old new) or (relation new old) is
  among the top-level hypotheses or the governors (possibly by way of
  backchaining and/or refinement; see below).  If relation is ~c[nil] or
  is not supplied, then it defaults to ~c[equal].  See also the command ~c[=],
  which is much more flexible.  Note that this command fails if no
  substitution is actually made.

  ~st[Note:]  No substitution takes place inside explicit values.  So for
  example, the instruction ~c[(equiv 3 x)] will cause ~c[3] to be replaced by
  ~c[x] if the current subterm is, say, ~c[(* 3 y)], but not if the current
  subterm is ~c[(* 4 y)] even though ~c[4 = (1+ 3)].

  The following remarks are quite technical and mostly describe a
  certain weak form of ``backchaining'' that has been implemented for
  ~c[equiv] in order to support the ~c[=] command.  In fact neither the term
  ~c[(relation old new)] nor the term ~c[(relation new old)] needs to be
  ~st[explicitly] among the current ``assumptions'', i.e., the top-level
  hypothesis or the governors.  Rather, there need only be such an
  assumption that ``tells us'' ~c[(r old new)] or ~c[(r new old)], for ~st[some]
  equivalence relation ~c[r] that ~st[refines] ~c[relation].  Here, ``tells us''
  means that either one of the indicated terms is among those
  assumptions, or else there is an assumption that is an implication
  whose conclusion is one of the indicated terms and whose hypotheses
  (gathered up by appropriately flattening the first argument of the
  ~c[implies] term) are all among the current assumptions."

  When the current subterm is the entire conclusion, this instruction
  adds ~c[expr] as a new top-level hypothesis, and create a subgoal
  identical to the existing current goal except that it has the
  negation of ~c[expr] as a new top-level hypothesis.  See also ~c[claim].
  The optional arguments control the use of governors and the
  ``flattening'' of new hypotheses, as we now explain.

  The argument ~c[use-hyps-flag] is only of interest when there are
  governors.  (To read about governors, see the documentation for the
  command ~c[hyps]).  In that case, if ~c[use-hyps-flag] is not supplied or is
  ~c[nil], then the description above is correct; but otherwise, it is not
  ~c[expr] but rather it is ~c[(implies govs expr)] that is added as a new
  top-level hypothesis (and whose negation is added as a top-level
  hypothesis for the new goal), where ~c[govs] is the conjunction of the
  governors.

  If ~c[do-not-flatten-flag] is supplied and not ~c[nil], then that is
  all there is to this command.  Otherwise (thus this is the default),
  when the claimed term (first argument) is a conjunction (~c[and]) of
  terms and the ~c[claim] instruction succeeds, then each (nested)
  conjunct of the claimed term is added as a separate new top-level
  hypothesis.  Consider the following example, assuming there are no
  governors.
  ~bv[]
  (casesplit (and (and (< x y) (integerp a)) (equal r s)) t)
  ~ev[]
  Three new top-level hypotheses are added to the current goal, namely
  ~c[(< x y)], ~c[(integerp a)], and ~c[(equal r s)].  In that case, only
  one hypothesis is added to create the new goal, namely the negation
  of ~c[(and (< x y) (integerp a) (equal r s))].  If the negation of this
  term had been ~c[claim]ed, then it would be the other way around:  the
  current goal would get a single new hypothesis while the new goal
  would be created by adding three hypotheses.

  Each instruction in the list ~c[instruction-list] is run, and the
  instruction ``succeeds'' if every instruction in ~c[instruction-list]
  ``succeeds''.  However, it might ``succeed'' even if some
  instructions in the list ``fail''; more generally, the various
  arguments control a number of aspects of the running of the
  instructions.  All this is explained in the paragraphs below.  First
  we embark on a general discussion of the instruction interpreter,
  including the notions of ``succeed'' and ``fail''.

  ~st[Note:]  The arguments are ~st[not] evaluated, except (in a sense) for
  ~c[success-expr], as described below.

  Each primitive and meta instruction can be thought of as returning
  an error triple (in the standard ACL2 sense), say ~c[(erp val state)].
  An instruction (primitive or meta) ``succeeds'' if ~c[erp] is ~c[nil] and
  ~c[val] is not ~c[nil]; otherwise it ``fails''.  (When we use the words
  ``succeed'' or ``fail'' in this technical sense, we'll always
  include them in double quotes.)  If an instruction ``fails,'' we say
  that that the failure is ``soft'' if ~c[erp] is ~c[nil]; otherwise the
  failure is ``hard''.  The ~c[sequence] command gives the user control
  over how to treat ``success'' and ``failure'' when sequencing
  instructions, though we have created a number of handy macro
  commands for this purpose, notably ~c[do-all], ~c[do-strict] and ~c[protect].

  Here is precisely what happens when a ~c[sequence] instruction is run.
  The instruction interpreter is run on the instructions supplied in
  the argument ~c[instruction-list] (in order).  The interpreter halts the
  first time there is a hard ``failure.'' except that if ~c[strict-flg] is
  supplied and not ~c[nil], then the interpreter halts the first time
  there is any ``failure.''  The error triple ~c[(erp val state)] returned
  by the ~c[sequence] instruction is the triple returned by the last
  instruction executed (or, the triple ~c[(nil t state)] if
  ~c[instruction-list] is ~c[nil]), except for the following provision.  If
  ~c[success-expr] is supplied and not ~c[nil], then it is evaluated with the
  state global variables ~c[erp] and ~c[val] (in ACL2 package) bound to the
  corresponding components of the error triple returned (as described
  above).  At least two values should be returned, and the first two
  of these will be substituted for ~c[erp] and ~c[val] in the triple finally
  returned by ~c[sequence].  For example, if ~c[success-expr] is ~c[(mv erp val)],
  then no change will be made to the error triple, and if instead it
  is ~c[(mv nil t)], then the ~c[sequence] instruction will ``succeed''.

  That concludes the description of the error triple returned by a
  ~c[sequence] instruction, but it remains to explain the effects of the
  arguments ~c[protect-flg] and ~c[no-prompt-flg].

  If ~c[protect-flg] is supplied and not ~c[nil] and if also the instruction

  General Form:

  ~ev[]
  If terms ~c[x] and ~c[y] are supplied, then replace ~c[x] by ~c[y] inside the
  current subterm if they are ``known'' to be ``equal''.  Here
  ``known'' means the following:  the prover is called as in the ~c[prove]
  command (using ~c[keyword-args]) to prove ~c[(equal x y)], except that a
  keyword argument ~c[:equiv] is allowed, in which case ~c[(equiv x y)] is
  proved instead, where ~c[equiv] is that argument.  (See below for how
  governors are handled.)

  Actually, ~c[keyword-args] is either a single non-keyword or is a list
  of the form ~c[((kw-1 x-1) ... (kw-n x-n))], where each ~c[kw-i] is one of
  the keywords ~c[:equiv], ~c[:otf-flg], ~c[:hints].  Here ~c[:equiv] defaults to
  ~c[equal] if the argument is not supplied or is ~c[nil], and otherwise
  should be the name of an ACL2 equivalence relation.  ~c[:Otf-flg] and
  ~c[:hints] give directives to the prover, as explained above and in the
  documentation for the ~c[prove] command; however, no prover call is made
  if ~c[:hints] is a non-~c[nil] atom or if ~c[keyword-args] is a single
  non-keyword (more on this below).

  ~em[Remarks on defaults]

     (1) If there is only one argument, say ~c[a], then ~c[x] defaults to the
  current subterm, in the sense that ~c[x] is taken to be the current
  subterm and ~c[y] is taken to be ~c[a].

     (2) If there are at least two arguments, then ~c[x] may be the symbol
  ~c[&], which then represents the current subterm.  Thus, ~c[(= a)] is
  equivalent to ~c[(= & a)].  (Obscure point:  actually, ~c[&] can be in any
  package, except the keyword package.)

     (3) If there are no arguments, then we look for a top-level
  hypothesis or a governor of the form ~c[(equal c u)] or ~c[(equal u c)],
  where ~c[c] is the current subterm.  In that case we replace the current
  subterm by ~c[u].

  As with the ~c[prove] command, we allow goals to be given ``bye''s in
  the proof, which may be generated by a ~c[:hints] keyword argument in
  ~c[keyword-args].  These result in the creation of new subgoals.

  A proof is attempted unless the ~c[:hints] argument is a non-~c[nil]
  atom other than :~c[none], or unless there is one element of
  ~c[keyword-args] and it is not a keyword.  In that case, if there are
  any hypotheses in the current goal, then what is attempted is a
  proof of the implication whose antecedent is the conjunction of the
  current hypotheses and governors and whose conclusion is the
  appropriate ~c[equal] term.

  ~st[Notes:]  (1) It is allowed to use abbreviations in the hints.
  (2) The keyword :~c[none] has the special role as a value of
  :~c[hints] that is shown clearly in an example above.  (3) If there
  are governors, then the new subgoal has as additional hypotheses the
  current governors."

  Examples:
  (rewrite reverse-reverse)
     -- apply the rewrite rule `reverse-reverse'
  (rewrite (:rewrite reverse-reverse))
     -- same as above
  (rewrite 2)
     -- apply the second rewrite rule, as displayed by show-rewrites
  rewrite
     -- apply the first rewrite rule, as displayed by show-rewrites
  (rewrite transitivity-of-< ((y 7)))
     -- apply the rewrite rule transitivity-of-< with the substitution
        that associates 7 to the ``free variable'' y
  (rewrite foo ((x 2) (y 3)) t)
     -- apply the rewrite rule foo by substituting 2 and 3 for free
        variables x and y, respectively, and also binding all other
        free variables possible by using the current context
        (hypotheses and governors)~/

  General Form:
  (rewrite &optional rule-id substitution instantiate-free)
  ~ev[]
  Replace the current subterm with a new term by applying a rewrite
  rule.  The replacement will be done according to the information provided by
  the ~c[show-rewrites] (~c[sr]) command.

  If ~c[rule-id] is a positive integer ~c[n], then the ~c[n]th rewrite
  rule as displayed by ~c[show-rewrites] is the one that is applied.  If
  ~c[rule-id] is ~c[nil] or is not supplied, then it is treated as the number
  1.  Otherwise, ~c[rule-id] should be either a rune of or name of a
  rewrite rule.  If a name is supplied, then any rule of that name may
  be used.  We say more about this, and describe the other optional arguments,
  below.

  Consider first the following example.  Suppose that the current subterm is
  ~c[(reverse (reverse y))] and that there is a rewrite rule called
  ~c[reverse-reverse] of the form
  ~bv[]
  (implies (true-listp x)
           (equal (reverse (reverse x)) x)) .
  ~ev[]
  Then the instruction ~c[(rewrite reverse-reverse)] would cause the current
  subterm to be replaced by ~c[y] and would create a new goal with conclusion
  ~c[(true-listp y)].  An exception is that if the top-level hypotheses imply
  ~c[(true-listp y)] using only ``trivial reasoning''
  (more on this below), then no new goal is created.

  If the ~c[rule-id] argument is a number or is not supplied, then the system
  will store an instruction of the form ~c[(rewrite name ...)], where ~c[name]
  is the name of a rewrite rule; this is in order to make it easier to replay
  instructions when there have been changes to the history.  Actually, instead
  of the name (whether the name is supplied or calculated), the system stores
  the ~il[rune] if there is any chance of ambiguity.  (Formally, ``ambiguity''
  here means that the rune being applied is of the form
  ~c[(:rewrite name . index)], where index is not ~c[nil].)

  Speaking in general, then, a ~c[rewrite] instruction works as follows:

  First, a rewrite rule is selected according to the arguments of the
  ~c[rewrite] instruction.  The selection is made as explained under ``General
  Form'' above.

  Next, the left-hand side of the rule is matched with the current subterm,
  i.e., a substitution ~c[unify-subst] is found such that if one instantiates
  the left-hand side of the rule with ~c[unify-subst], then one obtains the
  current subterm.  If this match fails, then the instruction fails.

  Next, an attempt is made to relieve (discharge) the hypotheses, much as the
  theorem prover relieves hypotheses except that there is no call to the
  rewriter.  First, the substitution ~c[unify-subst] is extended with the
  ~c[substitution] argument, which may bind free variables
  (~pl[free-variables]).  Each hypothesis of the ~il[rewrite] rule is then
  considered in turn, from first to last.  For each hypothesis, first the
  current substitution is applied, and then the system checks whether the
  hypothesis is ``clearly'' true in the current context.  If there are
  variables in the hypotheses of the rewrite rule that are not bound by the
  current substitution, then a weak attempt is made to extend that substitution
  so that the hypothesis is present in the current context (see the
  documentation for the proof-checker ~c[hyps] command under
  ~il[proof-checker-commands]), much as would be done by the theorem prover's
  rewriter.

  If in the process above there are free variables, but the proof-checker can
  see how to bind them to relieve all hypotheses, then it will do so in both
  the ~c[show-rewrites] (~c[sr]) and ~c[rewrite] commands.  But normally, if
  even one hypothesis remains unrelieved, then no automatic extension of the
  substitution is made.  Except, if ~c[instantiate-free] is not ~c[nil], then
  that extension to the substitution is kept.

  Finally, the instruction is applied as follows.  The current subterm is
  replaced by applying the final substitution described above to the right-hand
  side of the selected rewrite rule.  And, one new subgoal is created for each
  unrelieved hypothesis of the rule, whose top-level hypotheses are the
  governors and top-level hypotheses of the current goal and whose conclusion
  and current subterm are the instance, by that same final substitution, of
  that unrelieved hypothesis.

  ~st[Note:]  The substitution argument should be a list whose elements
  have the form ~c[(variable term)], where ~c[term] may contain
  abbreviations."

  The proof checker supports the same kind of documentation as does
  ACL2 proper.  The main difference is that you need to type
  ~bv[]
  (help command)
  ~ev[]
  in a list rather than ~c[:doc command].  So, to get all the
  documentation on ~c[command], type ~c[(help! command)] inside the
  interactive loop, but to get only a one-line description of the
  command together with some examples, type ~c[(help command)].  In the
  latter case, you can get the rest of the help by typing ~c[more!]; or
  type ~c[more] if you don't necessarily want all the rest of the help at
  once.  (Then keep typing ~c[more] if you want to keep getting more of
  the help for that command.)

  To summarize:  as with ACL2, you can type either of the following:
  ~bv[]
  more, more!
  -- to obtain more (or, all the rest of) the documentation last
     requested by help (or, outside the proof-checker's loop, :doc)
  ~ev[]
  It has been arranged that the use of ~c[(help command)] will tell you
  just about everything you could want to know about ~c[command], almost
  always by way of examples.  For more details about a command, use
  ~c[help!], ~c[more], or ~c[more!].

  We use the word ``command'' to refer to the name itself, e.g.
  ~c[rewrite].  We use the word ``instruction'' to refer to an input to
  the interactive system, e.g. ~c[(rewrite foo)] or ~c[(help split)].  Of
  course, we allow commands with no arguments as instructions in many
  cases, e.g. ~c[rewrite].  In such cases, ~c[command] is treated identically
  to ~c[(command)]."

     -- simplify the current subterm, but during the rewriting
        process first ``normalize'' it by pushing IFs to the

  General Form:
  (s &key rewrite normalize backchain-limit repeat in-theory hands-off
          expand)
  ~ev[]
  Simplify the current subterm according to the keyword parameters
  supplied.  First if-normalization is applied (unless the ~c[normalize]
  argument is ~c[nil]), i.e., each subterm of the form
  ~c[(f ... (if test x y) ...)]  is replaced by the term
  ~c[(if test (f ... x ...) (f ... y ...))]  except, of course, when
  ~c[f] is ~c[if] and the indicated ~c[if] subterm is in the second or
  third argument position.  Then rewriting is applied (unless the
  rewrite argument is ~c[nil]).  Finally this pair of actions is
  repeated ~-[] until the rewriting step causes no change in the term.
  A description of each parameter follows.
  ~bv[]
  :rewrite -- default t
  ~ev[]
  When non-~c[nil], instructs the system to use ACL2's rewriter (or,
  something close to it) during simplification.
  ~bv[]
  :normalize -- default t
  ~ev[]
  When non-~c[nil], instructs the system to use if-normalization (as
  described above) during simplification.
  ~bv[]
  :backchain-limit -- default 0
  ~ev[]
  Sets the number of recursive calls to the rewriter that are
  allowed for backchaining.  Even with the default of 0, some
  reasoning is allowed (technically speaking, type-set reasoning is
  allowed) in the relieving of hypotheses.
  ~bv[]
  :repeat -- default 0
  ~ev[]
  Sets the number of times the current term is to be rewritten.  If
  this value is ~c[t], then the default is used (as specified by the
  constant ~c[*default-s-repeat-limit*]).
  ~bv[]
  :in-theory, :hands-off, :expand
  ~ev[]
  These have their usual meaning; ~pl[hints].

  ~st[Note:]  if conditional rewrite rules are used that cause case splits
  because of the use of ~c[force], then appropriate new subgoals will be
  created, i.e., with the same current subterm (and address) but with
  each new (forced) hypothesis being negated and then used to create a
  corresponding new subgoal.  In that case, the current goal will have
  all such new hypotheses added to the list of top-level hypotheses."

;; The proof-checker's enabled state will be either the global enabled

  General Form:
  (in-theory &optional atom-or-theory-expression)
  ~ev[]
  If the argument is not supplied, then this command sets the
  current proof-checker theory (see below for explanation) to agree
  with the current ACL2 theory.  Otherwise, the argument should be a
  theory expression, and in that case the proof-checker theory is set
  to the value of that theory expression.

  The current proof-checker theory is used in all calls to the ACL2 theorem
  prover and rewriter from inside the proof-checker.  Thus, the most recent
  ~c[in-theory] instruction in the current ~c[state-stack] has an effect in the
  proof-checker totally analogous to the effect caused by an ~c[in-theory] hint
  or event in ACL2.  All ~c[in-theory] instructions before the last are
  ignored, because they refer to the current theory in the ACL2 ~ilc[state],
  not to the existing proof-checker theory.  For example:
  ~bv[]
     ACL2 !>:trans1 (enable bar)
      (UNION-THEORIES (CURRENT-THEORY :HERE)
                      '(BAR))
     ACL2 !>:trans1 (CURRENT-THEORY :HERE)
      (CURRENT-THEORY-FN :HERE WORLD)
     ACL2 !>
  ~ev[]
  Thus ~c[(in-theory (enable bar))] modifies the current theory of the current
  ACL2 world.  So for example, suppose that ~c[foo] is disabled outside the
  proof checker and you execute the following instructions, in this order.
  ~bv[]
     (in-theory (enable foo))
     (in-theory (enable bar))
  ~ev[]  
  Then after the second of these, ~c[bar] will be enabled in the proof-checker,
  but ~c[foo] will be disabled.  The reason is that
  ~c[(in-theory (enable bar))] instructs the proof-checker to modify the
  current theory (from outside the proof-checker, not from inside the
  proof-checker) by enabling ~c[bar].

  Note that ~c[in-theory] instructions in the proof-checker have no effect
  outside the proof-checker's interactive loop.

  If the most recent ~c[in-theory] instruction in the current state of the
  proof-checker has no arguments, or if there is no ~c[in-theory]
  instruction in the current state of the proof-checker, then the
  proof-checker will use the current ACL2 theory.  This is true even
  if the user has interrupted the interactive loop by exiting and
  changing the global ACL2 theory.  However, if the most recent
  ~c[in-theory] instruction in the current state of the proof-checker had
  an argument, then global changes to the current theory will have no
  effect on the proof-checker state."

  Expand the function call at the current subterm, and simplify

  Unlike ~c[s], it is permitted to set both ~c[:rewrite] and ~c[:normalize] to
  ~c[nil], which will result in no simplification; see ~c[x-dumb].

  ~st[Note] (obscure):  On rare occasions the current address may be
  affected by the use of ~c[x].  For example, suppose we have the
  definition
  ~bv[]
  (defun g (x) (if (consp x) x 3))
  ~ev[]
  and then we enter the proof-checker with
  ~bv[]
  (verify (if (integerp x) (equal (g x) 3) t)) .
  ~ev[]
  Then after invoking the instruction ~c[(dive 2 1)], so that the
  current subterm is ~c[(g x)], followed by the instruction ~c[x], we would
  expect the conclusion to be ~c[(if (integerp x) (equal 3 3) t)].
  However, the system actually replaces ~c[(equal 3 3)] with ~c[t] (because we
  use the ACL2 term-forming primitives), and hence the conclusion is
  actually ~c[(if (integerp x) (equal 3 3) t)].  Therefore, the current
  address is put at ~c[(2)] rather than ~c[(2 1)].  In such cases, a warning
  ``~c[NOTE]'' will be printed to the terminal.

  The other primitive commands to which the above ``truncation'' note
  applies are ~c[equiv], ~c[rewrite], and ~c[s]."

  ~ev[]
  Generalize using the indicated substitution, which should be a
  non-empty list.  Each element of that list should be a two-element
  list of the form ~c[(term variable)], where ~c[term] may use abbreviations.
  The effect of the instruction is to replace each such term in the
  current goal by the corresponding variable.  This replacement is
  carried out by a parallel substitution, outside-in in each
  hypothesis and in the conclusion.  More generally, actually, the
  ``variable'' (second) component of each pair may be ~c[nil] or a number,
  which causes the system to generate a new name of the form ~c[_] or ~c[_n],
  with ~c[n] a natural number; more on this below.  However, when a
  variable is supplied, it must not occur in any goal of the current
  proof-checker state.

  When the ``variable'' above is ~c[nil], the system will treat it as the
  variable ~c[|_|] if that variable does not occur in any goal of the
  current proof-checker state.  Otherwise it treats it as ~c[|_0|], or
  ~c[|_1|], or ~c[|_2|], and so on, until one of these is not among the
  variables of the current proof-checker state.  If the ``variable''
  is a non-negative integer ~c[n], then the system treats it as ~c[|_n|]
  unless that variable already occurs among the current goals, in
  which case it increments n just as above until it obtains a new
  variable.

  Substitute ~c[expr] for the ``free variable'' ~c[var], as explained below.

  A ``free variable'' is, for our purposes, a variable ~c[var] such that
  the instruction ~c[(free var)] has been executed earlier in the
  state-stack.  What ~c[(free var)] really does is to let ~c[var] be an
  abbreviation for the term ~c[(hide var)] (see documentation for
  ~c[add-abbreviation]).  What ~c[(put var expr)] really does is to unwind the
  state-stack, replacing that ~c[free] instruction with the instruction
  ~c[(add-abbreviation var expr)], so that future references to ~c[(? var)]
  become reference to ~c[expr] rather than to ~c[(hide var)], and then to

  b. You are not thinking in particular about the current term; you just want
  to get an idea of the context that the prover would build at the top-level,
  for forward-chaining.  Incorporate the conclusion but not the governors.
  Command:~nl[]
  ~c[(type-alist t nil)] ; equivalently, ~c[(type-alist t)]~eq[]

  2. You intend to use one of the ~il[proof-checker-commands] that does
  simplification, such as ~c[s] or ~c[x], and you want to see the context.
  Then include the surrounding ~c[if]-term governors but not the goal's
  conclusion.  Command:~nl[]

  conjoining it with all goals other than the current goal and those indicated
  by ~c[kept-goal-names], and those other goals are deleted.  If
  ~c[kept-goal-names] is omitted, then the the current goal must be of the form
  ~c[(name . n)], and the goals to conjoin into the current goal (and delete)
  are those with names of the form ~c[(name . k)] for ~c[k] >= ~c[n].

  NOTE: ~c[Wrap1] always ``succeeds'', even if there are no other goals to
  conjoin into the current goal (a message is printed in that case), and it
  always leaves you with no hypotheses at the top of the current goal's
  conclusion (as though ~c[top] and ~c[demote] had been executed, if
  necessary).

  ~c[instrs] was begun.  This conjunction becomes the new current goal and
  those ``new'' goals are dropped.

  The ~c[wrap-induct] command is identical to the ~ilc[proof-checker]
  ~c[induct] command, except that only a single goal is created:  the
  conjunction of the base and induction steps.

  Note:  The output will generally indicate that more than goal has been
  created, e.g.:
  ~bv[]
  Creating two new goals:  (MAIN . 1) and (MAIN . 2).
  ~ev[]
  However, ~c[wrap-induct] always creates a unique goal (when it succeeds).  A
  subsequent message clarifies this, for example:
  ~bv[]
  NOTE: Created ONLY one new goal, which is the current goal:
    (MAIN . 1)
