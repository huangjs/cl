;;; Preconditions.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; (1) You will need a profiling GCL image (probably GCL Version 2.6.5 or
; later).  In a Debian GCL installation, it should suffice to execute

; setenv GCL_PROF t

; before invoking GCL.  You have started up a profiling GCL image if and only
; if the word "profiling" appears in the GCL startup banner.  On non-Debian
; systems you may need to build gcl by hand by adding the --enable-gprof option
; to ./configure.  You might also find that you need to increase the default
; maxpages.

; (2) Rename init.lisp as follows:

; mv init.lisp init.lisp.ori

; (3) Follow the steps in "How to build a profiling ACL2/GCL executable" below,
; with book-name-list set to nil.

; NOTE: If you only want to profile ACL2 system functions, not functions
; defined in books, skip steps (4) through (6).

; (4) Put the form

; (setq compiler::*default-system-p* t)

; into a file ~/acl2-init.lsp.  This will cause GCL to create .o files that are
; suitable for profiling.

; (5) Certify all books of interest using the ACL2 executable you built in (3).
; These are the books containing functions that you want to profile.  Be sure
; first to remove any existing .cert files for these books if you are using
; "make certify-books" (or any method that avoids recertification of books that
; are already certified).  Example:

; make certify-books-fresh ACL2=/u/acl2/rel/gcl-gprof-saved_acl2

; (6) Optionally start up the ACL2 executable you built in (3), if you want
; user-defined *1* functions (executable counterparts) to be compiled too.
; Then in the ACL2 loop, include books with functions that you want to profile,
; which should have been certified in step (5), and then execute the following
; forms, which will create and compile file TMP2.lisp.

; (comp-fn :exec nil "2" state)

; Then exit ACL2 with (good-bye).

;;; End of "Preconditions."

; Now, follow the steps in "How to build a profiling ACL2/GCL executable" below
; (a second time, since you already executed (3) above), using the "books of
; interest" in (5) above for step (A) below.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; How to build a profiling ACL2/GCL executable.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; (A) Load this file in a profiling GCL and evaluate the function it defines,
; as follows.

; (load "save-gprof.lsp")
; (save-profiling-image book-name-list)

; where book-name-list is a list of book names (without .lisp extensions),
; where both relative and absolute pathnames are allowed.

; If this is your initial build (from step (3) above), use book-name-list =
; nil:

; (save-profiling-image nil)

; Otherwise, for example:

; (save-profiling-image
;   '("books/arithmetic/top-with-meta"
;     "books/data-structures/number-list-theory")
;   :tmp2 t)

; There are keyword arguments you may optionally supply (including :tmp2 above,
; which is also optional), as explained in the following example that shows
; their defaults.

; (save-profiling-image
;  '("books/arithmetic/top-with-meta"
;    "books/data-structures/number-list-theory")
;  :clean t ; Default behavior, if :clean is not supplied, is to recompile ACL2
;           ; source files exactly when axioms.o does not exist or
;           ; book-name-list is nil.  Specify :clean nil to recompile exactly
;           ; when axioms.o does not exist.  Specify :clean t to recompile
;           ; unconditionally.
;  :dir nil ; If not nil then this is a directory string, ending in slash, to
;           ; which "books/" should be appended to find the distributed books.
;  :tmp2 nll; When t, a TMP2.o file should exist (see step (6) above) to be
;           ; included for profiling.
;  )

; (B) Quit out of GCL, (good-bye).

; (C) Rename the resulting executable as desired.  For example:

; mv nsaved_acl2.gcl gcl-gprof-saved_acl2

; or, in a later pass,

; mv nsaved_acl2.gcl gcl-gprof-books-saved_acl2

; (D) Delete the wrapper script.

; rm nsaved_acl2

; (E) When all use of save-gprof.lsp is completed, optionally restore init.lisp:

; mv init.lisp.ori init.lisp

; (F) Delete the file ~/acl2-init.lsp if it was created in step (4).

;;; End of "How to build a profiling ACL2/GCL executable."

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; How to use a profiling ACL2/GCL executable.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Here is an example.  Start up a profiling ACL2/GCL executable that was built
; as described above.  Then submit the following forms.  Profiling information
; should appear after the last one, showing information about ACL2 source
; functions and also numeric-sort.

; (include-book "books/data-structures/number-list-theory")
; :q
; ; ONLY if you provided :tmp2 t with save-profiling-image above, in which
; ; case, include all books that were included when TMP2.o was created.
; ; NOTE that this does not seem to work if an absolute pathname is used, so if
; ; you are in a different directory from TMP2.o, you will need to create a
; ; soft link.
; (load "TMP2.o")
; ; If GCL aborts with the following, then next time try preceding the
; ; following with (si::sgc-on nil) and then optionally following it with
; ; (si::sgc-on t).
; (si::gprof-start)
; (lp)
; (length (numeric-sort (reverse (fromto 0 5000))))
; :q
; (si::gprof-quit)

; Note: temporary files, for example produced by calls of COMP, are not deleted
; in profiling images.  Nor is the process id used in their names, so two
; processes should not run with profiling in the same directory, or their
; temporary files could step on each other.  If this is a problem for you,
; please contact the ACL2 developers and we will see if we can improve the
; situation.
