;                           ACL2 CHARACTERS

; At one time we read the legal ACL2 characters from a string in a file, so
; that we could be confident that we know exactly what they are.  But if
; code-char is not a function, then we lose anyhow, because we have defined it
; in ACL2.  And if code-char is a function, then we can do our checking without
; having to get the characters from a file, the idea being that the range of
; code-char on {0,1,...,255} is exactly the set of legal ACL2 characters.

; Note that this issue is orthogonal to the problem of ensuring that #\c is
; read in as the same character in different ACL2 sessions, for any ACL2
; character c.  (Even #\Newline is potentially problematic, as its char-code is
; 10 in most Common Lisps but is 13 in MCL!)  Because of the latter issue, our
; story about ACL2 could include a caveat that certified books may only be
; soundly loaded into the same Lisp image in which they were certified.  When
; we say ``same lisp image'' we don't mean the same exact process necessarily,
; but rather simply an invocation of the same saved image.  Another reason for
; such a caveat, independent of the character-reading issue, is that different
; saved images may be tied into different compilers, thus making the object
; files of the books incompatible.

; However, we believe that we can prevent the most serious assaults on
; soundness due to implementation dependencies, simply by making notes in the
; version string, state global 'acl2-version; see :DOC version.

; Test that all purportedly standard characters are standard, and vice versa.
