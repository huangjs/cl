(in-package "ACL2")

; This file contains the functions that check the acceptable forms for
; the various classes of rules, the functions that generate the rules
; from the forms, and finally the functions that actually do the adding.
; It also contains various history management and command facilities whose
; implementation is intertwined with the storage of rules, e.g., :pr and
; some monitoring stuff.

; The structure of the file is that we first define the checkers and
; generators for each class of rule.  Each such section has a header
; like that shown below.  When we finish all the individual classes
; we enter the final sections, headed

; Section:  :REWRITE Rules

; In this section we develop the function chk-acceptable-
; rewrite-rule, which checks that all the :REWRITE rules generated
; from a term are legal.  We then develop add-rewrite-rule which does
; the actual generation and addition of the rules to the world.

; We first tear up the user's term into a bunch of conjoined
; implications, with unprettyify.

(defun unprettyify/add-hyps-to-pairs (hyps lst)

; Each element of lst is a pair of the form (hypsi . concli), where hypsi
; is a list of terms.  We append hyps to hypsi in each pair.

  (cond ((null lst) nil)
        (t (cons (cons (append hyps (caar lst)) (cdar lst))
                 (unprettyify/add-hyps-to-pairs hyps (cdr lst))))))

(defun unprettyify (term)

; This function returns a list of pairs (hyps . concl) such that the
; conjunction of all (implies (and . hyps) concl) is equivalent to
; term.  Hyps is a list of hypotheses, implicitly conjoined.  Concl
; does not begin with an AND (of course, its a macro, but concl
; doesn't begin with an IF that represents an AND) or IMPLIES.
; In addition concl doesn't begin with an open lambda.

; This function is used to extract the :REWRITE rules from a term.
; Lambdas are sort of expanded to expose the conclusion.  They are not
; expanded in the hypotheses, or within an function symbol other than
; the top-level IFs and IMPLIES.  But top-level lambdas (those enclosing
; the entire term) are blown away.

; Thus, if you have a proposed :REWRITE rule
;    (implies (and p q) (let ((x a)) (equal (f x) b)))
; it will be converted to
;    (implies (and p q) (equal (f a) b)).
; The rule
;    (let ((x a)) (implies (and (p x) (q x)) (equal (f x) b))) [1]
; will become
;    (implies (and (p a) (q a)) (equal (f a) b)).              [2]
; But
;    (implies (let ((x a)) (and (p x) (q x)))                  [3]
;             (equal (let ((x a)) (f x)) b))
; stays untouched.  In general, once you've moved the let into a
; hypothesis it is not seen or opened.  Once you move it into the
; equivalence relation of the conclusion it is not seen or opened.
; Note that this processing of lambdas can cause terms to be duplicated
; and simplified more than once (see a in [2] compared to [3]).

; x).  Then both y and z are moved forward, so the loop-stopper is the
; "expansion" of '((y . z) (x . y)).  This function exploits the fact
; that all-vars returns the set of variables listed in reverse
; print-order.

; In the paragraph above, the "expansion" of a substitution ((x1 .

; invisible function symbols as implemented here.  Cowles observation
; was that it would be very useful if x and (- x) were moved into
; adjacency by permutative rules.  His idea was to redefine term-order
; so that those two terms were of virtually equal weight.  Our notion
; of invisible function symbols and the handling of loop-stopper is
; meant to address Cowles original concern without complicating
; term-order, which is used in places besides permutative rewriting.

  ":Doc-Section Miscellaneous

  limit application of permutative rewrite rules~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a discussion of the syntax of the
  ~c[:loop-stopper] field of ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule-classes.  Here we describe how
  that field is used, and also how that field is created when the user
  does not explicitly supply it.

  For example, the built-in ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule ~c[commutativity-of-+],
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (acl2-numberp x)
                (acl2-numberp y))
           (equal (+ x y) (+ y x))),
  ~ev[]
  creates a rewrite rule with a loop-stopper of ~c[((x y binary-+))].
  This means, very roughly, that the term corresponding to ~c[y] must be
  ``smaller'' than the term corresponding to ~c[x] in order for this rule
  to apply.  However, the presence of ~ilc[binary-+] in the list means that
  certain functions that are ``invisible'' with respect to ~ilc[binary-+]
  (by default, ~ilc[unary--] is the only such function) are more or less
  ignored when making this ``smaller'' test.  We are much more precise
  below.~/

  Our explanation of loop-stopping is in four parts.  First we discuss
  ACL2's notion of ``term order.''  Next, we bring in the notion of
  ``invisibility'', and use it together with term order to define
  orderings on terms that are used in the loop-stopping algorithm.
  Third, we describe that algorithm.  These topics all assume that we
  have in hand the ~c[:loop-stopper] field of a given rewrite rule; the
  fourth and final topic describes how that field is calculated when
  it is not supplied by the user.

  ACL2 must sometimes decide which of two terms is syntactically
  simpler.  It uses a total ordering on terms, called the ``term
  order.''  Under this ordering constants such as ~c['(a b c)] are simpler
  than terms containing variables such as ~c[x] and ~c[(+ 1 x)].  Terms
  containing variables are ordered according to how many occurrences
  of variables there are.  Thus ~c[x] and ~c[(+ 1 x)] are both simpler than
  ~c[(cons x x)] and ~c[(+ x y)].  If variable counts do not decide the order,
  then the number of function applications are tried.  Thus ~c[(cons x x)]
  is simpler than ~c[(+ x (+ 1 y))] because the latter has one more
  function application.  Finally, if the number of function
  applications do not decide the order, a lexicographic ordering on
  Lisp objects is used.  ~l[term-order] for details.

  When the loop-stopping algorithm is controlling the use of
  permutative ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules it allows ~c[term1] to be moved leftward over
  ~c[term2] only if ~c[term1] is smaller, in a suitable sense.  Note: The
  sense used in loop-stopping is ~st[not] the above explained term order
  but a more complicated ordering described below.  The use of a total
  ordering stops rules like commutativity from looping indefinitely
  because it allows ~c[(+ b a)] to be permuted to ~c[(+ a b)] but not vice
  versa, assuming ~c[a] is smaller than ~c[b] in the ordering.  Given a set of
  permutative rules that allows arbitrary permutations of the tips of
  a tree of function calls, this will normalize the tree so that the
  smallest argument is leftmost and the arguments ascend in the order
  toward the right.  Thus, for example, if the same argument appears
  twice in the tree, as ~c[x] does in the ~ilc[binary-+] tree denoted by the
  term ~c[(+ a x b x)], then when the allowed permutations are done, all
  occurrences of the duplicated argument in the tree will be adjacent,
  e.g., the tree above will be normalized to ~c[(+ a b x x)].

  Suppose the loop-stopping algorithm used term order, as noted above,
  and consider the ~ilc[binary-+] tree denoted by ~c[(+ x y (- x))].  The
  arguments here are in ascending term order already.  Thus, no
  permutative rules are applied.  But because we are inside a
  ~c[+-expression] it is very convenient if ~c[x] and ~c[(- x)] could be given
  virtually the same position in the ordering so that ~c[y] is not
  allowed to separate them.  This would allow such rules as
  ~c[(+ i (- i) j) = j] to be applied.  In support of this, the
  ordering used in the control of permutative rules allows certain
  unary functions, e.g., the unary minus function above, to be
  ``invisible'' with respect to certain ``surrounding'' functions,
  e.g., ~ilc[+] function above.

  Briefly, a unary function symbol ~c[fn1] is invisible with respect to a
  function symbol ~c[fn2] if ~c[fn2] belongs to the value of ~c[fn1] in
  ~ilc[invisible-fns-table]; also ~pl[set-invisible-fns-table], which
  explains its format and how it can be set by the user.  Roughly
  speaking, ``invisible'' function symbols are ignored for the
  purposes of the term-order test.

  Consider the example above, ~c[(+ x y (- x))].  The translated version
  of this term is ~c[(binary-+ x (binary-+ y (unary-- x)))].  The initial
  ~ilc[invisible-fns-table] makes ~ilc[unary--] invisible with repect to ~ilc[binary-+].
  The commutativity rule for ~ilc[binary-+] will attempt to swap ~c[y] and
  ~c[(unary-- x)] and the loop-stopping algorithm is called to approve or
  disapprove.  If term order is used, the swap will be disapproved.
  But term order is not used.  While the loop-stopping algorithm is
  permuting arguments inside a ~ilc[binary-+] expression, ~ilc[unary--] is
  invisible.  Thus, insted of comparing ~c[y] with ~c[(unary-- x)], the
  loop-stopping algorithm compares ~c[y] with ~c[x], approving the swap
  because ~c[x] comes before ~c[y].

  Here is a more precise specification of the total order used for
  loop-stopping with respect to a list, ~c[fns], of functions that are to
  be considered invisible.  Let ~c[x] and ~c[y] be distinct terms; we specify
  when ``~c[x] is smaller than ~c[y] with respect to ~c[fns].''  If ~c[x] is the
  application of a unary function symbol that belongs to ~c[fns], replace
  ~c[x] by its argument.  Repeat this process until the result is not the
  application of such a function; let us call the result ~c[x-guts].
  Similarly obtain ~c[y-guts] from ~c[y].  Now if ~c[x-guts] is the same term as
  ~c[y-guts], then ~c[x] is smaller than ~c[y] in this order iff ~c[x] is smaller than
  ~c[y] in the standard term order.  On the other hand, if ~c[x-guts] is
  different than ~c[y-guts], then ~c[x] is smaller than ~c[y] in this order iff
  ~c[x-guts] is smaller than ~c[y-guts] in the standard term order.

  Now we may describe the loop-stopping algorithm.  Consider a rewrite
  rule with conclusion ~c[(equiv lhs rhs)] that applies to a term ~c[x] in a
  given context; ~pl[rewrite].  Suppose that this rewrite rule has
  a loop-stopper field (technically, the ~c[:heuristic-info] field) of
  ~c[((x1 y1 . fns-1) ... (xn yn . fns-n))].  (Note that this field can be
  observed by using the command ~c[:]~ilc[pr] with the name of the rule;
  ~pl[pr].)  We describe when rewriting is permitted.  The
  simplest case is when the loop-stopper list is ~c[nil] (i.e., ~c[n] is ~c[0]);
  in that case, rewriting is permitted.  Otherwise, for each ~c[i] from 1
  to ~c[n] let ~c[xi'] be the actual term corresponding to the variable ~c[xi]
  when ~c[lhs] is matched against the term to be rewritten, and similarly
  correspond ~c[yi'] with ~c[y].  If ~c[xi'] and ~c[yi'] are the same term for all ~c[i],
  then rewriting is not permitted.  Otherwise, let ~c[k] be the least ~c[i]
  such that ~c[xi'] and ~c[yi'] are distinct.  Let ~c[fns] be the list of all
  functions that are invisible with respect to every function in
  ~c[fns-k], if ~c[fns-k] is non-empty; otherwise, let ~c[fns] be ~c[nil].  Then

  for a rewrite rule when this field is not supplied by the user.  (On
  the other hand, to see how the user may specify the ~c[:loop-stopper],
  ~pl[rule-classes].)  Suppose the conclusion of the rule is of
  the form ~c[(equiv lhs rhs)].  First of all, if ~c[rhs] is not an instance
  of the left hand side by a substitution whose range is a list of
  distinct variables, then the loop-stopper field is ~c[nil].  Otherwise,
  consider all pairs ~c[(u . v)] from this substitution with the property
  that the first occurrence of ~c[v] appears in front of the first
  occurrence of ~c[u] in the print representation of ~c[rhs].  For each such ~c[u]
  and ~c[v], form a list ~c[fns] of all functions ~c[fn] in ~c[lhs] with the property
  that ~c[u] or ~c[v] (or both) appears as a top-level argument of a subterm
  of ~c[lhs] with function symbol ~c[fn].  Then the loop-stopper for this
  rewrite rule is a list of all lists ~c[(u v . fns)].~/"

; the loop-stoppers, the "probably" is warranted.  There may be other
; reasons it is warranted.  But this is just a heuristic check performed
; as a service to the user.

; One might ask why we do the maybe-subsumes.  We do the subsumes
; check on the hyps of two rules with matching :lhs.  In a hardware
; related file we were once confronted with a rule1 having :hyps

; ((BOOLEANP A0) (BOOLEANP B0) (BOOLEANP S0) (BOOLEANP C0_IN)
;  (BOOLEANP A1) (BOOLEANP B1) (BOOLEANP S1) (BOOLEANP C1_IN)

;  (S_REL A0 B0 C0_IN S0)
;  ...)

; and a rule2 with :hyps

; ((BOOLEANP A0) (BOOLEANP B0) (BOOLEANP S0)
;  (BOOLEANP A1) (BOOLEANP B1) (BOOLEANP S1)
;  ...)

; The subsumes computation ran for over 30 minutes (and was eventually
; aborted).  The problem is that the extra variables in rule1, e.g.,
; C0_IN, were matchable in many different ways, e.g., C0_IN <- A0,
; C0_IN <- B0, etc., all of which must be tried in a subsumption
; check.  But no matter how you get rid of (BOOLEANP C0_IN) by
; choosing C0_IN, you will eventually run into the S_REL hypothesis in
; rule1 which has no counterpart in rule2.  Thus we installed the
; relatively quick maybe-subsumes check.  The check scans the :hyps of
; the first rule and determines whether there is some hypothesis that
; cannot possibly be matched against the hyps of the other rule.

; generated by all equivalence relations known to be preserved for at least one
; variable occurrence in the pattern that was matched to give the unifying
; substitution (the left left-hand side of a rewrite rule or max-term of a
; linear rule).  As we move through hyps, we may encounter a hypothesis (equal
; var term) or (equiv var (double-rewrite term)) that binds a variable, var, in
; which case we will extend var-geneqv-alist for var at that point.  Note that

  ":Doc-Section Rule-Classes

  make some arithmetic inequality rules~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and how they are
  used to build rules from formulas.  An example ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula
  from which a ~c[:linear] rule might be built is:
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (implies (and (eqlablep e)           if inequality reasoning begins to
                (true-listp x))        consider how (length (member a b))
           (<= (length (member e x))   compares to any other term, add to
               (length x)))            set of known inequalities the fact
                                       that it is no larger than (length b),
                                       provided (eqlablep a) and (true-listp b)
                                       rewrite to t

  General Form:
  (and ...
       (implies (and ...hi...)
                (implies (and ...hk...)
                         (and ...
                              (rel lhs rhs)
                              ...)))
       ...)
  ~ev[]

  Note: One ~c[:linear] rule class object might create many linear
  arithmetic rules from the ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula.  To create the rules,
  we first flatten the ~ilc[and] and ~ilc[implies] structure of the formula,
  transforming it into a conjunction of formulas, each of the form
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and h1 ... hn) (rel lhs rhs))
  ~ev[]
  where no hypothesis is a conjunction and ~c[rel] is one of the
  inequality relations ~ilc[<], ~ilc[<=], ~ilc[=], ~ilc[>], or ~ilc[>=].  If
  necessary, the hypothesis of such a conjunct may be vacuous.
  We create a ~c[:linear] rule for each such conjunct, if possible, and
  otherwise cause an error.~/

  Each rule has one or more ``trigger
  terms'' which may be specified by the user using the ~c[:trigger-terms]
  field of the rule class or which may be defaulted to values chosen
  by the system.  We discuss the determination of trigger terms after
  discussing how linear rules are used.

  ~c[:linear] rules are used by an arithmetic decision procedure
  during rewriting.  ~l[linear-arithmetic] and
  ~pl[non-linear-arithmetic].  Here we assume that the reader is
  familiar with the material described in ~ilc[linear-arithmetic].

  Recall that we eliminate the unknowns of an inequality in
  term-order, largest unknowns first.  (~l[term-order].)  In order to
  facilitate this strategy, we store the inequalities in ``linear pots''.
  For purposes of the present discussion, let us say that an inequality is
  ``about'' its largest unknown.  Then, all of the inequalities about
  a particular unknown are stored in the same linear pot, and the pot
  is said to be ``labeled'' with that unknown.  This storage layout
  groups all of the inequalities which are potential candidates for
  cancellation with each other into one place.  It is also key to the
  efficient operation of ~c[:linear] rules.

  If the arithmetic decision procedure has stabilized and not yielded a
  contradiction, we scan through the list of linear pots examining
  each label as we go.  If the trigger term of some ~c[:linear] rule
  can be instantiated to match the label, we so instantiate that rule
  and attempt to relieve the hypotheses with general-purpose rewriting.
  If we are successful, we add the rule's instantiated conclusion to
  our set of inequalities.  This may let cancellation continue.

  Note: Problems may arise if you explicitly store a linear lemma
  under a trigger term that, when instantiated, is not the largest
  unknown in the instantiated concluding inequality.  Suppose for
  example you store the linear rule ~c[(<= (fn i j) (/ i (* j j)))] under
  the trigger term ~c[(fn i j)].  Then when the system ``needs'' an
  inequality about ~c[(fn a b)], (i.e., because ~c[(fn a b)] is the 
  label of some linear pot, and hence the largest unknown in some
  inequality), it
  will appeal to the rule and deduce ~c[(<= (fn a b) (/ a (* b b)))].
  However, the largest unknown in this inequality is ~c[(/ a (* b b))] and
  hence it will be stored in a linear pot labeled with ~c[(/ a (* b b))].
  The original, triggering inequality which is in a pot about ~c[(fn a b)]
  will therefore not be cancelled against the new one.  It is generally
  best to specify as a trigger term one of the ``maximal'' terms of the
  polynomial, as described below.

  We now describe how the trigger terms are determined.  Most of the
  time, the trigger terms are not specified by the user and are
  instead selected by the system.  However, the user may specify the
  terms by including an explicit ~c[:trigger-terms] field in the rule
  class, e.g.,
  ~bv[]
  General Form of a Linear Rule Class:
  (:LINEAR :COROLLARY formula
           :TRIGGER-TERMS (term1 ... termk))
  ~ev[]
  Each ~c[termi] must be a term and must not be a variable, quoted
  constant, lambda application, ~c[let-expression] or ~c[if-expression].  In
  addition, each ~c[termi] must be such that if all the variables in the
  term are instantiated and then the hypotheses of the corollary
  formula are relieved (possibly instantiating additional free
  variables), then all the variables in the concluding inequality are
  instantiated.  We generate a linear rule for each conjuctive branch
  through the corollary and store each rule under each of the
  specified triggers.  Thus, if the corollary formula contains several
  conjuncts, the variable restrictions on the ~c[termi] must hold for each
  conjunct.

  If ~c[:trigger-terms] is omitted the system computes a set of trigger
  terms.  Each conjunct of the corollary formula may be given a unique
  set of triggers depending on the variables that occur in the
  conjunct and the addends that occur in the concluding inequality.
  In particular, the trigger terms for a conjunct is the list of all
  ``maximal addends'' in the concluding inequality.

  The ``addends'' of ~c[(+ x y)] and ~c[(- x y)] are the union of the
  addends of ~c[x] and ~c[y].  The addends of ~c[(- x)] and ~c[(* n x)],
  where ~c[n] is a rational constant, is just ~c[{x}].  The
  addends of an inequality are the union of the addends of the left-
  and right-hand sides.  The addends of any other term, ~c[x], is
  ~c[{x}].

  A term is maximal for a conjunct ~c[(implies hyps concl)] of the
  corollary if (a) the term is a non-variable, non-quote, non-lambda
  application, non-~ilc[let] and non-~ilc[if] expression, (b) the term
  contains enough variables so that when they are instantiated and the
  hypotheses are relieved (which may bind some free variables;
  ~pl[free-variables]) then all the variables in ~c[concl] are
  instantiated, and (c) no other addend is always ``bigger'' than the
  term, in the technical sense described below.

  The technical notion below depends on the notion of ~em[fn-count],
  the number of function symbols in a term, and ~em[pseudo-fn-count],
  which is the number of function symbols implicit in a constant (see
  the comment on pseduo-fn-count in the definition of var-fn-count in
  the sources for details).  We say ~c[term1] is always bigger than
  ~c[term2] if all instances of ~c[term1] have a larger fn-count
  (actually lexicographic order of fn-count and pseudo-fn-count) than
  the corresponding instances of ~c[term2].  This is equivalent to
  saying that the fn-count of ~c[term1] is larger than that of
  ~c[term2] (by ``fn-count'' here we mean the lexicographic order of
  fn-count and pseudo-fn-count) and the variable bag for ~c[term2] is
  a subbag of that for ~c[term1].  For example, ~c[(/ a (* b b))] is
  always bigger than ~c[(fn a b)] because the first has two function
  applications and ~c[{a b}] is a subbag of ~c[a b b], but
  ~c[(/ a (* b b))] is not always bigger than ~c[(fn a x)].")

; Otherwise, we return term.

; Warning: This function expands the definitions of the primitives
; above without considering their guards.  This is unsound if the
; expanded form is used in place of the term.  For example, (= x y)
; is here expanded to (equal x y), and in the case that the
; guards are violated the two terms are not equivalent.  Do not call
; this function casually!

; What is the intended use of this function?  Suppose the user has
; proved a theorem, (implies hyps (= a b)) and wants it stored as a
; :LINEAR rule.  We instead store a rule concluding with (equal a b)!
; Note that the rule we store is not equivalent to the rule proved!
; We've ignored the acl2-numberp guards on =.  Isn't that scary?  Yes.
; But how do :LINEAR rules get used?  Let max be one of the maximal
; terms of the rule we store and suppose we encounter a term, max',
; that is an instance of max.  Then we will instantiate the stored
; conclusion (equal a b) with the substitution derived from max' to
; obtain (equal a' b') and then linearize that.  The linearization of
; an equality insists that both arguments be known rational -- i.e.
; that their type-sets are a subset of *ts-rational*.  Thus, in
; essence we are acting as though we had the theorem (implies (and
; (rationalp a) (rationalp b) hyps) (equal a b)) and use type-set to
; relieve the first two hyps.  But this imagined theorem is an easy
; consequence of (implies hyps (= a b)) given that (rationalp a) and

  ":Doc-Section Rule-Classes

  show that a relation is well-founded on a set~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and
  how they are used to build rules from formulas.  An example
  ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula from which a ~c[:well-founded-relation] rule might be
  built is as follows.  (Of course, the functions ~c[pairp], ~c[lex2p], and
  ~c[ordinate] would have to be defined first.)
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (and (implies (pairp x) (o-p (ordinate x)))
       (implies (and (pairp x)
                     (pairp y)
                     (lex2p x y))
                (o< (ordinate x) (ordinate y))))
  ~ev[]
  The above example establishes that ~c[lex2p] is a well-founded
  relation on ~c[pairp]s.  We explain and give details below.~/

  Exactly two general forms are recognized:
  ~bv[]
  General Forms
  (AND (IMPLIES (mp x) (O-P (fn x)))              ; Property 1
       (IMPLIES (AND (mp x)                       ; Property 2
                     (mp y)
                     (rel x y))
                (O< (fn x) (fn y)))),
  ~ev[]
  or
  ~bv[]
  (AND (O-P (fn x))                               ; Property 1
       (IMPLIES (rel x y)                         ; Property 2
                (O< (fn x) (fn y))))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[mp], ~c[fn], and ~c[rel] are function symbols, ~c[x] and ~c[y] are distinct
  variable symbols, and no other ~c[:well-founded-relation] theorem about
  ~c[fn] has been proved.  When the second general form is used, we act as
  though the first form were used with ~c[mp] being the function that
  ignores its argument and returns ~c[t].  The discussion below therefore
  considers only the first general form.

  Note: We are very rigid when checking that the submitted formula is
  of one of these forms.  For example, in the first form, we insist
  that all the conjuncts appear in the order shown above.  Thus,
  interchanging the two properties in the top-level conjunct or
  rearranging the hyptheses in the second conjunct both produce
  unrecognized forms.  The requirement that each ~c[fn] be proved
  well-founded at most once ensures that for each well-founded
  relation, ~c[fn], there is a unique ~c[mp] that recognizes the domain on
  which ~c[rel] is well-founded.  We impose this requirement simply so
  that ~c[rel] can be used as a short-hand when specifying the
  well-founded relations to be used in definitions; otherwise the
  specification would have to indicate which ~c[mp] was to be used.

  ~c[Mp] is a predicate that recognizes the objects that are supposedly
  ordered in a well-founded way by ~c[rel].  We call such an object an
  ``~c[mp]-measure'' or simply a ``measure'' when ~c[mp] is understood.
  Property 1 tells us that every measure can be mapped into an ACL2
  ordinal.  (~l[o-p].)  This mapping is performed by ~c[fn].
  Property 2 tells us that if the measure ~c[x] is smaller than the
  measure ~c[y] according to ~c[rel] then the image of ~c[x] under ~c[fn] is a smaller
  than that of ~c[y], according to the well-founded relation ~ilc[o<].
  (~l[o<].)  Thus, the general form of a
  ~c[:well-founded-relation] formula establishes that there exists a
  ~c[rel]-order preserving embedding (namely via ~c[fn]) of the ~c[mp]-measures
  into the ordinals.  We can thus conclude that ~c[rel] is well-founded on
  ~c[mp]-measures.

  Such well-founded relations are used in the admissibility test for
  recursive functions, in particular, to show that the recursion
  terminates.  To illustrate how such information may be used,
  consider a generic function definition
  ~bv[]
  (defun g (x) (if (test x) (g (step x)) (base x))).
  ~ev[]
  If ~c[rel] has been shown to be well-founded on ~c[mp]-measures, then ~c[g]'s
  termination can be ensured by finding a measure, ~c[(m x)], with the
  property that ~c[m] produces a measure:
  ~bv[]
  (mp (m x)),                                     ; Defun-goal-1
  ~ev[]
  and that the argument to ~c[g] gets smaller (when measured by ~c[m] and
  compared by ~c[rel]) in the recursion,
  ~bv[]
  (implies (test x) (rel (m (step x)) (m x))).    ; Defun-goal-2
  ~ev[]
  If ~c[rel] is selected as the ~c[:well-founded-relation] to be used in the
  definition of ~c[g], the definitional principal will generate and
  attempt to prove ~c[defun-goal-1] and ~c[defun-goal-2] to justify ~c[g].  We
  show later why these two goals are sufficient to establish the
  termination of ~c[g].  Observe that neither the ordinals nor the
  embedding, ~c[fn], of the ~c[mp]-measures into the ordinals is involved in
  the goals generated by the definitional principal.

  Suppose now that a ~c[:well-founded-relation] theorem has been proved
  for ~c[mp] and ~c[rel].  How can ~c[rel] be ``selected as the
  ~c[:well-founded-relation]'' by ~ilc[defun]?  There are two ways.
  First, an ~ilc[xargs] keyword to the ~ilc[defun] event allows the
  specification of a ~c[:well-founded-relation].  Thus, the definition
  of ~c[g] above might be written
  ~bv[]
  (defun g (x)
   (declare (xargs :well-founded-relation (mp . rel)))
   (if (test x) (g (step x)) (base x)))
  ~ev[]
  Alternatively, ~c[rel] may be specified as the
  ~c[:default-well-founded-relation] in ~ilc[acl2-defaults-table] by
  executing the event
  ~bv[]
  (set-default-well-founded-relation rel).
  ~ev[]
  When a ~ilc[defun] event does not explicitly specify the relation in its
  ~ilc[xargs] the default relation is used.  When ACL2 is initialized, the
  default relation is ~ilc[o<].

  Finally, though it is probably obvious, we now show that
  ~c[defun-goal-1] and ~c[defun-goal-2] are sufficient to ensure the
  termination of ~c[g] provided ~c[property-1] and ~c[property-2] of ~c[mp] and ~c[rel]
  have been proved.  To this end, assume we have proved ~c[defun-goal-1]
  and ~c[defun-goal-2] as well as ~c[property-1] and ~c[property-2] and we show
  how to admit ~c[g] under the primitive ACL2 definitional principal
  (i.e., using only the ordinals).  In particular, consider the
  definition event
  ~bv[]
  (defun g (x)
   (declare (xargs :well-founded-relation o<
                   :measure (fn (m x))))
   (if (test x) (g (step x)) (base x)))
  ~ev[]
  Proof that ~c[g] is admissible:  To admit the definition of ~c[g] above we
  must prove
  ~bv[]
  (o-p (fn (m x)))                        ; *1
  ~ev[]
  and
  ~bv[]
  (implies (test x)                               ; *2
           (o< (fn (m (step x))) (fn (m x)))).
  ~ev[]
  But *1 can be proved by instantiating ~c[property-1] to get
  ~bv[]
  (implies (mp (m x)) (o-p (fn (m x)))),
  ~ev[]
  and then relieving the hypothesis with ~c[defun-goal-1], ~c[(mp (m x))].

  Similarly, *2 can be proved by instantiating ~c[property-2] to get
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (mp (m (step x)))
                (mp (m x))
                (rel (m (step x)) (m x)))
           (o< (fn (m (step x))) (fn (m x))))
  ~ev[]
  and relieving the first two hypotheses by appealing to two
  instances of ~c[defun-goal-1], thus obtaining
  ~bv[]
  (implies (rel (m (step x)) (m x))
           (o< (fn (m (step x))) (fn (m x)))).
  ~ev[]
  By chaining this together with ~c[defun-goal-2],
  ~bv[]
  (implies (test x)
           (rel (m (step x)) (m x)))
  ~ev[]
  we obtain *2.  Q.E.D.")

; Section:  :BUILT-IN-CLAUSE Rules

(deflabel built-in-clauses
  :doc
  ":Doc-Section Rule-Classes

  to build a clause into the simplifier~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and
  how they are used to build rules from formulas.  A ~c[:built-in-clause]
  rule can be built from any formula other than propositional
  tautologies.  Roughly speaking, the system uses the list of built-in
  clauses as the first method of proof when attacking a new goal.  Any
  goal that is subsumed by a built in clause is proved ``silently.''~/

  ACL2 maintains a set of ``built-in'' clauses that are used to
  short-circuit certain theorem proving tasks.  We discuss this at
  length below.  When a theorem is given the rule class
  ~c[:built-in-clause] ACL2 flattens the ~ilc[implies] and ~ilc[and] structure of the
  ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula so as to obtain a set of formulas whose
  conjunction is equivalent to the given corollary.  It then converts
  each of these to clausal form and adds each clause to the set of
  built-in clauses.

  For example, the following ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] (regardless of the definition
  of ~c[abl])
  ~bv[]
  (and (implies (and (true-listp x)
                     (not (equal x nil)))
                (< (acl2-count (abl x))
                   (acl2-count x)))
       (implies (and (true-listp x)
                     (not (equal nil x)))
                (< (acl2-count (abl x))
                   (acl2-count x))))
  ~ev[]
  will build in two clauses,
  ~bv[]
  {(not (true-listp x))
   (equal x nil)
   (< (acl2-count (abl x)) (acl2-count x))}
  ~ev[]
  and
  ~bv[]
  {(not (true-listp x))
   (equal nil x)
   (< (acl2-count (abl x)) (acl2-count x))}.
  ~ev[]
  We now give more background.

  Recall that a clause is a set of terms, implicitly representing the
  disjunction of the terms.  Clause ~c[c1] is ``subsumed'' by clause ~c[c2] if
  some instance of ~c[c2] is a subset ~c[c1].

  For example, let ~c[c1] be
  ~bv[]
  {(not (consp l))
   (equal a (car l))
   (< (acl2-count (cdr l)) (acl2-count l))}.
  ~ev[]
  Then ~c[c1] is subsumed by ~c[c2], shown below,
  ~bv[]
  {(not (consp x))
   ; second term omitted here
   (< (acl2-count (cdr x)) (acl2-count x))}
  ~ev[]
  because we can instantiate ~c[x] in ~c[c2] with ~c[l] to obtain a subset of
  ~c[c1].

  Observe that ~c[c1] is the clausal form of
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (consp l)
                (not (equal a (car l))))
           (< (acl2-count (cdr l)) (acl2-count l))),
  ~ev[]
  ~c[c2] is the clausal form of
  ~bv[]
  (implies (consp l)
           (< (acl2-count (cdr l)) (acl2-count l)))
  ~ev[]
  and the subsumption property just means that ~c[c1] follows trivially
  from ~c[c2] by instantiation.

  The set of built-in clauses is just a set of known theorems in
  clausal form.  Any formula that is subsumed by a built-in clause is
  thus a theorem.  If the set of built-in theorems is reasonably
  small, this little theorem prover is fast.  ACL2 uses the ``built-in
  clause check'' in four places: (1) at the top of the iteration in
  the prover -- thus if a built-in clause is generated as a subgoal it
  will be recognized when that goal is considered, (2) within the
  simplifier so that no built-in clause is ever generated by
  simplification, (3) as a filter on the clauses generated to prove
  the termination of recursively ~ilc[defun]'d functions and (4) as a
  filter on the clauses generated to verify the guards of a function.

  The latter two uses are the ones that most often motivate an
  extension to the set of built-in clauses.  Frequently a given
  formalization problem requires the definition of many functions
  which require virtually identical termination and/or guard proofs.
  These proofs can be short-circuited by extending the set of built-in
  clauses to contain the most general forms of the clauses generated
  by the definitional schemes in use.

  The attentive user might have noticed that there are some recursive
  schemes, e.g., recursion by ~ilc[cdr] after testing ~ilc[consp], that ACL2 just
  seems to ``know'' are ok, while for others it generates measure
  clauses to prove.  Actually, it always generates measure clauses but
  then filters out any that pass the built-in clause check.  When ACL2
  is initialized, the clause justifying ~ilc[cdr] recursion after a ~ilc[consp]
  test is added to the set of built-in clauses.  (That clause is ~c[c2]
  above.)

  Note that only a subsumption check is made; no rewriting or
  simplification is done.  Thus, if we want the system to ``know''
  that ~ilc[cdr] recursion is ok after a negative ~ilc[atom] test (which, by the
  definition of ~ilc[atom], is the same as a ~ilc[consp] test), we have to build
  in a second clause.  The subsumption algorithm does not ``know''
  about commutative functions.  Thus, for predictability, we have
  built in commuted versions of each clause involving commutative
  functions.  For example, we build in both
  ~bv[]
  {(not (integerp x))
   (< 0 x)
   (= x 0)
   (< (acl2-count (+ -1 x)) (acl2-count x))}
  ~ev[]
  and the commuted version
  ~bv[]
  {(not (integerp x))
   (< 0 x)
   (= 0 x)
   (< (acl2-count (+ -1 x)) (acl2-count x))}
  ~ev[]
  so that the user need not worry whether to write ~c[(= x 0)] or ~c[(= 0 x)]
  in definitions.

  ~c[:built-in-clause] rules added by the user can be enabled and
  disabled.")

  make a rule used by the typing mechanism~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and
  how they are used to build rules from formulas.  An example
  ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula from which a ~c[:compound-recognizer] rule might be
  built is:
  ~bv[]
  Example: 
  (implies (alistp x)         When (alistp x) is assumed true,
           (true-listp x))    add the additional hypothesis that x
                              is of primitive type true-listp.~/

  General Forms:
  (implies (fn x) concl)               ; (1)
  (implies (not (fn x)) concl)         ; (2)
  (and (implies (fn x) concl1)         ; (3)
       (implies (not (fn x)) concl2))
  (if (fn x) concl1 concl2)            ; (4)
  (iff (fn x) concl)                   ; (5)
  (equal (fn x) concl)                 ; (6)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[fn] is a Boolean valued function of one argument, ~c[x] is a
  variable symbol, and the system can deduce some restriction on the
  primitive type of ~c[x] from the assumption that ~c[concl] holds.  The third
  restriction is vague but one way to understand it is to weaken it a
  little to ``and ~c[concl] is a non-tautological conjunction or
  disjunction of the primitive type recognizers listed below.''

  The primitive ACL2 types and a suitable primitive recognizing
  expression for each are listed below.
  ~bv[]
    type                suitable primitive recognizer

    zero                (equal x 0)
    negative integers   (and (integerp x) (< x 0))
    positive integers   (and (integerp x) (> x 0))
    negative ratio      (and (rationalp x)
                             (not (integerp x))
                             (< x 0))
    positive ratio      (and (rationalp x)
                             (not (integerp x))
                             (> x 0))
    complex rational    (complex-rationalp x)
    nil                 (equal x nil)
    t                   (equal x t)
    other symbols       (and (symbolp x)
                             (not (equal x nil))
                             (not (equal x t)))
    proper conses       (and (consp x)
                             (true-listp x))
    improper conses     (and (consp x)
                             (not (true-listp x)))
    strings             (stringp x)
    characters          (characterp x)
  ~ev[]
  Thus, a suitable ~c[concl] to recognize the naturals would be
  ~c[(or (equal x 0) (and (integerp x) (> x 0)))] but it turns out that we
  also permit ~c[(and (integerp x) (>= x 0))].  Similarly, the true-lists
  could be specified by
  ~bv[]
  (or (equal x nil) (and (consp x) (true-listp x)))
  ~ev[]
  but we in fact allow ~c[(true-listp x)].  When time permits we will
  document more fully what is allowed or implement a macro that
  permits direct specification of the desired type in terms of the
  primitives.

  There are essentially four forms of ~c[:compound-recognizer] rules, as the
  third and fourth forms are equivalent, as are the fifth and sixth.  We
  explain how such rules are used by considering the individual forms.

  Consider a rule of the first form, ~c[(implies (fn x) concl)].  The
  effect of such a rule is that when the rewriter assumes ~c[(fn x)] true,
  as it would while diving through ~c[(if (fn x) xxx ...)] to rewrite ~c[xxx],
  it restricts the type of ~c[x] as specified by ~c[concl].  However, when
  assuming ~c[(fn x)] false, as necessary in ~c[(if (fn x) ... xxx)], the rule
  permits no additional assumptions about the type of ~c[x].  For example,
  if ~c[fn] is ~c[primep], i.e., the predicate that recognizes prime numbers,
  then ~c[(implies (primep x) (and (integerp x) (>= x 0)))] is a compound
  recognizer rule of the first form.  When ~c[(primep x)] is assumed true,
  the rewriter gains the additional information that ~c[x] is a natural
  number.  When ~c[(primep x)] is assumed false, no additional information
  is gained ~-[] since ~c[x] may be a non-prime natural or may not even be a
  natural.

  The second general form addresses itself to the symmetric case, when
  assuming ~c[(fn x)] false permits type restrictions on ~c[x] but assuming
  ~c[(fn x)] true permits no such restrictions.  For example, if we
  defined ~c[exprp] to be the recognizer for well-formed expressions for
  some language in which all symbols, numbers, character objects and
  strings were well-formed ~-[] e.g., the well-formedness rules only put
  restrictions on expressions represented by ~ilc[consp]s ~-[] then the
  theorem ~c[(implies (not (exprp x)) (consp x))] is a rule of the second
  form.  Assuming ~c[(exprp x)] true tells us nothing about the type of ~c[x];
  assuming it false tells us ~c[x] is a ~ilc[consp].

  The third and fourth general forms, which are really equivalent, address
  themselves to the case where one type may be deduced from ~c[(fn x)] and a
  generally unrelated type may be deduced from its negation.  If we modified
  the expression recognizer above so that character objects are illegal, then
  rules of the third and fourth forms are
  ~bv[]
  (and (implies (exprp x) (not (characterp x)))
       (implies (not (exprp x)) (or (consp x) (characterp x)))).
  (if (exprp x) 
      (not (characterp x))
    (or (consp x) (characterp x)))
  ~ev[]
  Finally, rules of the fifth and sixth classes address the case where ~c[fn]
  recognizes all and only the objects whose type is described.  In
  these cases, ~c[fn] is really just a new name for some ``compound
  recognizers.''  The classic example is ~c[(booleanp x)], which is just a
  handy combination of two primitive types:
  ~bv[]
  (iff (booleanp x) (or (equal x t) (equal x nil))).
  ~ev[]

  Often it is best to disable ~c[fn] after proving that it is a compound
  recognizer, since ~c[(fn x)] will not be recognized as a compound
  recognizer once it has been expanded.

  Every time you prove a new compound recognizer rule about ~c[fn] it overrides
  all previously proved compound recognizer rules about ~c[fn].  Thus, if you
  want to establish the type implied by ~c[(fn x)] and you want to establish
  the type implied by ~c[(not (fn x))], you must prove a compound recognizer
  rule of the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth forms.  Proving a rule of the
  first form followed by one of the second only leaves the second fact in the
  data base.

  Compound recognizer rules can be disabled with the effect that older
  rules about ~c[fn], if any, are exposed.

  If you prove more than one compound recognizer rule for a function, you
  may see a ~st[warning] message to the effect that the new rule is not as
  ``restrictive'' as the old.  That is, the new rules do not give the
  rewriter strictly more type information than it already had.  The
  new rule is stored anyway, overriding the old, if enabled.  You may
  be playing subtle games with enabling or rewriting.  But two other
  interpretions are more likely, we think.  One is that you have
  forgotten about an earlier rule and should merely print it out to
  make sure it says what you know and then forget your new rule.  The
  other is that you meant to give the system more information and the
  system has simply been unable to extract the intended type
  information from the term you placed in the conclusion of the new
  rule.  Given our lack of specificity in saying how type information
  is extracted from rules, you can hardly blame yourself for this
  problem.  Sorry.  If you suspect you've been burned this way, you
  should rephrase the new rule in terms of the primitive recognizing
  expressions above and see if the warning is still given.  It would
  also be helpful to let us see your example so we can consider it as
  we redesign this stuff.

  Compound recognizer rules are similar to ~c[:]~ilc[forward-chaining] rules in
  that the system deduces new information from the act of assuming
  something true or false.  If a compound recognizer rule were stored
  as a forward chaining rule it would have essentially the same effect
  as described, when it has any effect at all.  The important point is
  that ~c[:]~ilc[forward-chaining] rules, because of their more general and
  expensive form, are used ``at the top level'' of the simplification
  process: we forward chain from assumptions in the goal being proved.
  But compound recognizer rules are built in at the bottom-most level
  of the simplifier, where type reasoning is done.

  All that said, compound recognizer rules are a rather fancy,
  specialized mechanism.  It may be more appropriate to create
  ~c[:]~ilc[forward-chaining] rules instead of ~c[:compound-recognizer]
  rules.")

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and
  how they are used to build rules from formulas.  An example
  ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula from which a ~c[:forward-chaining] rule might be
  built is:
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (implies (and (p x) (r x))        when (p a) appears in a formula to be
           (q (f x)))               simplified, try to establish (r a) and
                                    if successful, add (q (f a)) to the
                                    known assumptions
  ~ev[]
  To specify the triggering terms provide a non-empty list of terms
  as the value of the ~c[:trigger-terms] field of the rule class object.~/
  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  Any theorem, provided an acceptable triggering term exists.
  ~ev[]
  Forward chaining rules are generated from the corollary term as
  follows.  If that term has the form ~c[(implies hyp concl)], then the
  ~ilc[let] expressions in ~c[concl] (formally, lambda expressions) are expanded
  away, and the result is treated as a conjunction, with one forward
  chaining rule with hypothesis ~c[hyp] created for each conjunct.  In the
  other case, where the corollary term is not an ~ilc[implies], we process
  it as we process the conclusion in the first case.

  The ~c[:trigger-terms] field of a ~c[:forward-chaining] rule class object
  should be a non-empty list of terms, if provided, and should have
  certain properties described below.  If the ~c[:trigger-terms] field is
  not provided, it defaults to the singleton list containing the
  ``atom'' of the first hypothesis of the formula.  (The atom of
  ~c[(not x)] is ~c[x]; the atom of any other term is the term itself.)  If
  there are no hypotheses and no ~c[:trigger-terms] were provided, an
  error is caused.

  A triggering term is acceptable if it is not a variable, a quoted
  constant, a lambda application, a ~ilc[let]-expression, or a
  ~ilc[not]-expression, and every variable symbol in the conclusion of the
  theorem either occurs in the hypotheses or occurs in the trigger.

  ~c[:Forward-chaining] rules are used by the simplifier before it begins
  to rewrite the literals of the goal.  (Forward chaining is thus carried
  out from scratch for each goal.)  If any term in the goal is an
  instance of a trigger of some forward chaining rule, we try to
  establish the hypotheses of that forward chaining theorem (from the
  negation of the goal).  To relieve a hypothesis we only use type
  reasoning, evaluation of ground terms, and presence among our known
  assumptions.  We do not use rewriting.  So-called free variables in
  hypotheses are treated specially; ~pl[free-variables].  If all hypotheses
  are relieved, we add the instantiated conclusion to our known assumptions.

  ~em[Caution].  Forward chaining does not actually add terms to the goals
  displayed during proof attempts.  Instead, it extends an associated
  ~em[context], called ``assumptions'' in the preceding paragraph, that
  ACL2 builds from the goal currently being proved.  The context
  starts out with ``obvious'' consequences of the negation of the
  goal.  For example, if the goal is
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (p x) (q (f x)))
           (c x))
  ~ev[]
  then the context notes that ~c[(p x)] and ~c[(q (f x))] are non-~c[nil] and

  ~c[(c x)] is ~c[nil].  Forward chaining is then used to expand the context.
  For example, if a forward chaining rule has ~c[(f x)] as a trigger term
  and has body ~c[(implies (p x) (r (f x)))], then the context is extended
  by binding ~c[(r (f x))] to non-~c[nil].  Note however that since ~c[(r (f x))]
  is put into the context, not the goal, it is ~em[not] further simplified.
  If ~c[f] is an enabled nonrecursive function symbol then this forward
  chaining rule may well be useless, since calls of ~c[f] may be expanded
  away.

  Another common misconception is this:  Suppose that you forward
  chain and put ~c[(< (f x) (g x))] into the context.  Then does it go
  into the linear arithmetic data base?  Answer: no.  Alternative
  question: do we go looking for linear lemmas about ~c[(g x)]?  Answer:
  no.  The linear arithmetic data base is built up by a process very
  similar to but independent of forward chaining.")

  make a ~c[:meta] rule (a hand-written simplifier)~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and
  how they are used to build rules from formulas.  Meta rules extend
  the ACL2 simplifier with hand-written code to transform certain
  terms to equivalent ones.  To add a meta rule, the ~c[:]~ilc[corollary]
  formula must establish that the hand-written ``metafunction''
  preserves the meaning of the transformed term.

  Example ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formulas from which ~c[:meta] rules might be
  built are:
  ~bv[]
  Examples:
  (equal (evl x a)                  ; Modify the rewriter to use fn to
         (evl (fn x) a))            ; transform terms.  The :trigger-fns
                                    ; of the :meta rule-class specify
                                    ; the top-most function symbols of
                                    ; those x that are candidates for
                                    ; this transformation.

  (implies (and (pseudo-termp x)    ; As above, but this illustrates
                (alistp a))         ; that without loss of generality we
           (equal (evl x a)         ; may restrict x to be shaped like a

  (implies (and (pseudo-termp x)    ; As above (with or without the
                (alistp a)          ; hypotheses on x and a) with the
                (evl (hyp-fn x) a)) ; additional restriction that the
           (equal (evl x a)         ; meaning of (hyp-fn x) is true in
                  (evl (fn x) a)))  ; the current context.  That is, the
                                    ; applicability of the transforma-
                                    ; tion may be dependent upon some

  ~ev[]
  A non-~c[nil] list of function symbols must be supplied as the value
  of the ~c[:trigger-fns] field in a ~c[:meta] rule class object.~/
  ~bv[]
  General Forms:
  (implies (and (pseudo-termp x)        ; this hyp is optional
                (alistp a)              ; this hyp is optional
                (ev (hyp-fn x ...) a))  ; this hyp is optional
           (equiv (ev x a)
                  (ev (fn x ...) a)))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[equiv] is a known ~il[equivalence] relation, ~c[x] and
  ~c[a] are distinct variable names, and ~c[ev] is an evaluator
  function (see below), and ~c[fn] is a function symbol, as is
  ~c[hyp-fn] when provided.  The arguments to ~c[fn] and ~c[hyp-fn]
  should be identical.  In the most common case, both take a single
  argument, ~c[x], which denotes the term to be simplified.  If ~c[fn]
  and/or ~c[hyp-fn] are ~il[guard]ed, their ~il[guard]s should be
  (implied by) ~ilc[pseudo-termp].  ~l[pseudo-termp].  We say the
  theorem above is a ``metatheorem'' or ``metalemma'' and ~c[fn] is a
  ``metafunction'', and ~c[hyp-fn] is a ``hypothesis metafunction''.

  If ``~c[...]'' is empty, i.e., the metafunctions take just one argument,
  we say they are ``vanilla flavored.''  If ``~c[...]'' is non-empty,
  we say the metafunctions are ``extended.''  Extended
  metafunctions can access ~ilc[state] and context sensitive information
  to compute their results, within certain limits.  We discuss vanilla
  metafunctions here and recommend a thorough understanding of them
  before proceeding (at which time
  ~pl[extended-metafunctions]).

  We defer discussion of the case in which there is a hypothesis
  metafunction and for now address the case in which the other two
  hypotheses are present.

  In the discussion below, we refer to the argument, ~c[x], of ~c[fn]
  and ~c[hyp-fn] as a ``term.''  When these metafunctions are executed
  by the simplifier, they will be applied to (the quotations of)
  terms.  But during the proof of the metatheorem itself, ~c[x] may not
  be the quotation of a term.  If the ~ilc[pseudo-termp] hypothesis is
  omitted, ~c[x] may be any object.  Even with the ~ilc[pseudo-termp]
  hypothesis, ~c[x] may merely ``look like a term'' but use
  non-function symbols or function symbols of incorrect arity.  In any
  case, the metatheorem is stronger than necessary to allow us to
  apply the metafunctions to terms, as we do in the discussion below.
  We return later to the question of proving the metatheorem.

  Suppose the general form of the metatheorem above is proved with the
  ~ilc[pseudo-termp] and ~ilc[alistp] hypotheses.  Then when the simplifier
  encounters a term, ~c[(h t1 ... tn)], that begins with a function
  symbol, ~c[h], listed in ~c[:trigger-fns], it applies the
  metafunction, ~c[fn], to the quotation of the term, i.e., it
  evaluates ~c[(fn '(h t1 ... tn))] to obtain some result, which can be
  written as ~c['val].  If ~c['val] is different from ~c['(h t1 ... tn)]
  and ~c[val] is a term, then ~c[(h t1 ... tn)] is replaced by ~c[val],
  which is then passed along for further rewriting.  Because the
  metatheorem establishes the correctness of ~c[fn] for all terms (even
  non-terms!), there is no restriction on which function symbols are
  listed in the ~c[:trigger-fns].  Generally, of course, they should be
  the symbols that head up the terms simplified by the metafunction
  ~c[fn].  ~l[term-table] for how one obtains some assistance
  towards guaranteeing that ~c[val] is indeed a term.

  The ``evaluator'' function, ~c[ev], is a function that can evaluate a
  certain class of expressions, namely, all of those composed of
  variables, constants, and applications of a fixed, finite set of
  function symbols, ~c[g1], ..., ~c[gk].  Generally speaking, the set of
  function symbols handled by ~c[ev] is chosen to be exactly the
  function symbols recognized and manipulated by the metafunctions
  being introduced.  For example, if ~c[fn] manipulates expressions in
  which ~c[']~ilc[equal] and ~c[']~ilc[binary-append] occur as function
  symbols, then ~c[ev] is generally specified to handle ~ilc[equal] and
  ~ilc[binary-append].  The actual requirements on ~c[ev] become clear
  when the metatheorem is proved.  The standard way to introduce an
  evaluator is to use the ACL2 macro ~ilc[defevaluator], though this is
  not strictly necessary.  ~l[defevaluator] for details.

  Why are we justified in using metafunctions this way?  Suppose
  ~c[(fn 'term1)] is ~c['term2].  What justifies replacing ~c[term1] by
  ~c[term2]?  The first step is to assert that ~c[term1] is
  ~c[(ev 'term1 a)], where ~c[a] is an alist that maps ~c['var] to
  ~c[var], for each variable ~c[var] in ~c[term1].  This step is
  incorrect, because ~c['term1] may contain function symbols other than
  the ones, ~c[g1], ..., ~c[gk], that ~c[ev] knows how to handle.  But we
  can grow ~c[ev] to a ``larger'' evaluator, ~c[ev*], an evaluator for
  all of the symbols that occur in ~c[term1] or ~c[term2].  We can prove
  that ~c[ev*] satisfies the ~il[constraint]s on ~c[ev].  Hence, the
  metatheorem holds for ~c[ev*] in place of ~c[ev], by functional
  instantiation.  We can then carry out the proof of the
  ~il[equivalence] of ~c[term1] and ~c[term2] as follows: Fix ~c[a] to be
  an alist that maps the quotations of the variables of ~c[term1] and
  ~c[term2] to themselves.  Then,
  ~bv[]
  term1 = (ev* 'term1 a)      ; (1) by construction of ev* and a
        = (ev* (fn 'term1) a) ; (2) by the metatheorem for ev*
        = (ev* 'term2 a)      ; (3) by evaluation of fn
        = term2               ; (4) by construction of ev* and a
  ~ev[]
  Note that in line (2) above, where we appeal to the (functional
  instantiation of the) metatheorem, we can relieve its (optional)
  ~ilc[pseudo-termp] and ~ilc[alistp] hypotheses by appealing to the facts
  that ~c[term1] is a term and ~c[a] is an alist by construction.

  Finally, we turn to the second case, in which there is a hypothesis
  metafunction.  In that case, consider as before what happens when
  the simplifier encounters a term, ~c[(h t1 ... tn)], where ~c[h] is
  listed in ~c[:trigger-fns].  This time, after it applies ~c[fn] to
  ~c['(h t1 ... tn)] to obtain the quotation of some new term, ~c['val],
  it then applies the hypothesis metafunction, ~c[hyp-fn].  That is, it
  evaluates ~c[(hyp-fn '(h t1 ... tn))] to obtain some result, which
  can be written as ~c['hyp-val].  If ~c[hyp-val] is not in fact a term,
  the metafunction is not used.  Provided ~c[hyp-val] is a term, the
  simplifier attempts to establish (by conventional backchaining) that
  this term is non-~c[nil] in the current context.  If this attempt
  fails, then the meta rule is not applied.  Otherwise, ~c[(h t1...tn)]
  is replaced by ~c[val] as in the previous case (where there was no
  hypothesis metafunction).

  Why is it justified to make this extension to the case of hypothesis
  metafunctions?  First, note that the rule
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (pseudo-termp x)
                (alistp a)
                (ev (hyp-fn x) a))
           (equal (ev x a)
                  (ev (fn x) a)))
  ~ev[]
  is logically equivalent to the rule
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (pseudo-termp x)
                (alistp a))
           (equal (ev x a)
                  (ev (new-fn x) a)))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[(new-fn x)] is defined to be 
  ~c[(list 'if (hyp-fn x) (fn x) x)].  (If we're careful, we realize
  that this argument depends on making an extension of ~c[ev] to an
  evaluator ~c[ev*] that handles ~ilc[if] and the functions manipulated by
  ~c[hyp-fn].)  If we write ~c['term] for the quotation of the present
  term, and if ~c[(hyp-fn 'term)] and ~c[(fn 'term)] are both terms, say
  ~c[hyp1] and ~c[term1], then by the previous argument we know it is
  sound to rewrite term to ~c[(if hyp1 term1 term)].  But since we have
  established in the current context that ~c[hyp1] is non-~c[nil], we
  may simplify ~c[(if hyp1 term1 term)] to ~c[term1], as desired.

  We now discuss the role of the ~ilc[pseudo-termp] hypothesis.
  ~c[(Pseudo-termp x)] checks that ~c[x] has the shape of a term.
  Roughly speaking, it ensures that ~c[x] is a symbol, a quoted
  constant, or a true list consisting of a ~c[lambda] expression or
  symbol followed by some pseudo-terms.  Among the properties of terms
  not checked by ~ilc[pseudo-termp] are that variable symbols never begin
  with ampersand, ~c[lambda] expressions are closed, and function
  symbols are applied to the correct number of arguments.
  ~l[pseudo-termp].

  There are two possible roles for ~ilc[pseudo-termp] in the development
  of a metatheorem:  it may be used as the ~il[guard] of the
  metafunction and/or hypothesis metafunction and it may be used as a
  hypothesis of the metatheorem.  Generally speaking, the
  ~ilc[pseudo-termp] hypothesis is included in a metatheorem only if it
  makes it easier to prove.  The choice is yours.  (An extreme example
  of this is when the metatheorem is invalid without the hypothesis!)
  We therefore address ourselves the question:  should a metafunction
  have a ~ilc[pseudo-termp] ~il[guard]?  A ~ilc[pseudo-termp] ~il[guard] for
  a metafunction, in connection with other considerations described
  below, improves the efficiency with which the metafunction is used
  by the simplifier.

  To make a metafunction maximally efficient you should (a) provide it
  with a ~ilc[pseudo-termp] ~il[guard] and exploit the ~il[guard] when
  possible in coding the body of the function
  (~pl[guards-and-evaluation], especially the section on
  efficiency issues), (b) verify the ~il[guard]s of the metafunction
  (~pl[verify-guards]), and (c) compile the metafunction
  (~pl[comp]).  When these three steps have been taken the simplifier
  can evaluate ~c[(fn 'term1)] by running the compiled ``primary code''
  (~pl[guards-and-evaluation]) for ~c[fn] directly in Common Lisp.

  Before discussing efficiency issues further, let us review for a
  moment the general case in which we wish to evaluate ~c[(fn `obj)]
  for some ~c[:]~ilc[logic] function.  We must first ask whether the
  ~il[guard]s of ~c[fn] have been verified.  If not, we must evaluate
  ~c[fn] by executing its logic definition.  This effectively checks
  the ~il[guard]s of every subroutine and so can be slow.  If, on the
  other hand, the ~il[guard]s of ~c[fn] have been verified, then we can
  run the primary code for ~c[fn], provided ~c['obj] satisfies the
  ~il[guard] of ~c[fn].  So we must next evaluate the ~il[guard] of
  ~c[fn] on ~c['obj].  If the ~il[guard] is met, then we run the primary
  code for ~c[fn], otherwise we run the logic code.

  Now in the case of a metafunction for which the three steps above
  have been followed, we know the ~il[guard] is (implied by)
  ~ilc[pseudo-termp] and that it has been verified.  Furthermore, we know
  without checking that the ~il[guard] is met (because ~c[term1] is a
  term and hence ~c['term1] is a ~ilc[pseudo-termp]).  Hence, we can use
  the compiled primary code directly.

  We strongly recommend that you compile your metafunctions, as well
  as all their subroutines.  Guard verification is also recommended.

  Finally, we present a very simple example of the use of ~c[:meta]
  rules, based on one provided by Robert Krug.  This example
  illustrates a trick for avoiding undesired rewriting after applying
  a metafunction or any other form of rewriting.  To elaborate: in
  general, the term ~c[t2] obtained by applying a metafunction to a
  term ~c[t1] is then handed immediately to the rewriter, which
  descends recursively through the arguments of function calls to
  rewrite ~c[t2] completely.  But if ~c[t2] shares a lot of structure
  with ~c[t1], then it might not be worthwhile to rewrite ~c[t2]
  immediately.  (A rewrite of ~c[t2] will occur anyhow the next time a
  goal is generated.)  The trick involves avoiding this rewrite by
  wrapping ~c[t2] inside a call of ~ilc[hide], which in turn is inside
  a call of a user-defined ``unhiding'' function, ~c[unhide].

  ~bv[]
  (defun unhide (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard t))
    x)

  (defthm unhide-hide
    (equal (unhide (hide x))
           x)
    :hints ((\"Goal\" :expand ((hide x)))))

  (in-theory (disable unhide))

  (defun my-plus (x y)
    (+ x y))

  (in-theory (disable my-plus))

  (defevaluator evl evl-list
    ((my-plus x y)
     (binary-+ x y)
     (unhide x)
     (hide x)))

  (defun meta-fn (term)
    (declare (xargs :guard (pseudo-termp term)))
    (if (and (consp term)
             (equal (length term) 3)
             (equal (car term) 'my-plus))
        `(UNHIDE (HIDE (BINARY-+ ,(cadr term) ,(caddr term))))
      term))

  (defthm my-meta-lemma
    (equal (evl term a)
           (evl (meta-fn term) a))
    :hints ((\"Goal\" :in-theory (enable my-plus)))
    :rule-classes ((:meta :trigger-fns (my-plus))))

  ~ev[]

  Notice that in the following (silly) conjectre, ACL2 initially does
  only does the simplification directed by the metafunction; a second
  goal is generated before the commuativity of addition can be
  applied.  If the above calls of ~c[UNHIDE] and ~c[HIDE] had been
  stripped off, then ~c[Goal'] would have been the term printed in
  ~c[Goal''] below.

  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>(thm
          (equal (my-plus b a)
                 ccc))

  This simplifies, using the :meta rule MY-META-LEMMA and the :rewrite
  rule UNHIDE-HIDE, to

  Goal'
  (EQUAL (+ B A) CCC).

  This simplifies, using the :rewrite rule COMMUTATIVITY-OF-+, to

  Goal''
  (EQUAL (+ A B) CCC).
  ~ev[]

  The discussion above probably suffices to make good use of this
  ~c[(UNHIDE (HIDE ...))] trick.  However, we invite the reader who
  wishes to understand the trick in depth to evaluate the following
  form before submitting the ~ilc[thm] form above.
  ~bv[]
  (trace$ (rewrite :entry (list (take 2 arglist))
                   :exit (list (car values)))
          (rewrite-with-lemma :entry (list (take 2 arglist))
                              :exit (take 2 values)))
  ~ev[]
  The following annotated subset of the trace output (which may appear
  a bit different depending on the underlying Common Lisp
  implementation) explains how the trick works.

  ~bv[]
      2> (REWRITE ((MY-PLUS B A) NIL))>
        3> (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA
                ((MY-PLUS B A)
                 (REWRITE-RULE (:META MY-META-LEMMA)
                               1822
                               NIL EQUAL META-FN NIL META NIL NIL)))>

  We apply the meta rule, then recursively rewrite the result, which is the
  (UNHIDE (HIDE ...)) term shown just below.

          4> (REWRITE ((UNHIDE (HIDE (BINARY-+ B A)))
                       ((A . A) (B . B))))>
            5> (REWRITE ((HIDE (BINARY-+ B A))
                         ((A . A) (B . B))))>

  The HIDE protects its argument from being touched by the rewriter.

            <5 (REWRITE (HIDE (BINARY-+ B A)))>
            5> (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA
                    ((UNHIDE (HIDE (BINARY-+ B A)))
                     (REWRITE-RULE (:REWRITE UNHIDE-HIDE)
                                   1806 NIL EQUAL (UNHIDE (HIDE X))
                                   X ABBREVIATION NIL NIL)))>

  Now we apply UNHIDE-HIDE, then recursively rewrite its right-hand
  side in an environment where X is bound to (BINARY-+ B A).

              6> (REWRITE (X ((X BINARY-+ B A))))>

  Notice that at this point X is cached, so REWRITE just returns
  (BINARY-+ B A).

              <6 (REWRITE (BINARY-+ B A))>
            <5 (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA T (BINARY-+ B A))>

  General Form of an Extended :Meta theorem:
  (implies (and (pseudo-termp x)              ; this hyp is optional
                (alistp a)                    ; this hyp is optional

  ~ev[]
  where the restrictions are as described in the ~il[documentation] for
  ~ilc[meta] and, in addition, ~c[mfc] and ~c[state] are distinct variable
  symbols (different also from ~c[x] and ~c[a]) and ~c[state] is literally the
  symbol ~c[STATE].  A ~c[:meta] theorem of the above form installs ~c[fn] as a
  metatheoretic simplifier with hypothesis function ~c[hyp-fn], exactly as for
  vanilla metafunctions.  The only difference is that when the metafunctions
  are applied, some contextual information is passed in via the ~c[mfc]
  argument and the ACL2 ~ilc[state] is made available.

  ~l[meta] for a discussion of vanilla flavored metafunctions.  This
  documentation assumes you are familiar with the simpler situation, in
  particular, how to define a vanilla flavored metafunction, ~c[fn], and its
  associated hypothesis metafunction, ~c[hyp-fn], and how to state and prove
  metatheorems installing such functions.  Defining extended metafunctions
  requires that you also be familiar with many ACL2 implementation details.
  This documentation is sketchy on these details; see the ACL2 source code or
  email the ~il[acl2-help] list if you need more help.~/

  The metafunction context, ~c[mfc], is a list containing many different data
  structures used by various internal ACL2 functions.  We do not document the
  form of ~c[mfc].  Your extended metafunction should just take ~c[mfc] as its
  second formal and pass it into the functions mentioned below.  The ACL2
  ~c[state] is well-documented (~pl[state]).  The following expressions may be
  useful in defining extended metafunctions.

  ~c[(mfc-clause mfc)]: returns the current goal, in clausal form.  A clause is
  a list of ACL2 terms, implicitly denoting the disjunction of the listed
  terms.  The clause returned by ~c[mfc-clause] is the clausal form of the
  translation (~pl[trans]) of the goal or subgoal on which the rewriter is
  working.  When a metafunction calls ~c[mfc-clause], the term being rewritten
  by the metafunction either occurs somewhere in this clause or, perhaps more
  commonly, is being rewritten on behalf of some lemma to which the rewriter
  has backchained while trying to rewrite a term in the clause.

  ~c[(mfc-ancestors mfc)]: returns the current list of the negations of the
  backchaining hypotheses being pursued.  In particular,
  ~c[(null (mfc-ancestors mfc))] will be true if and only if the term being
  rewritten is part of the current goal; otherwise, that term is part of a
  hypothesis from a rule currently being considered for use.  Exception: An
  ancestor of the form ~c[(:binding-hyp hyp unify-subst)] indicates that
  ~c[hyp] has been encountered as a hypothesis of the form ~c[(equal var term)]
  or ~c[(equiv var (double-rewrite-term))] that binds variable ~c[var] to the
  result of rewriting ~c[term] under ~c[unify-subst].

  ~c[(mfc-type-alist mfc)]: returns the type-alist governing the occurrence of
  the term, ~c[x], being rewritten by the metafunction.  A type-alist is an
  association list, each element of which is of the form ~c[(term ts . ttree)].
  Such an element means that the term ~c[term] has the ~il[type-set] ~c[ts].
  The ~c[ttree] component is probably irrelevant here.  All the terms in the
  type-alist are in translated form (~pl[trans]).  The ~c[ts] are numbers
  denoting finite Boolean combinations of ACL2's primitive types
  (~pl[type-set]).  The type-alist includes not only information gleaned from the
  conditions governing the term being rewritten but also that gleaned from
  forward chaining from the (negations of the) other literals in the clause
  returned by ~c[mfc-clause].

  ~c[(w state)]: returns the ACL2 logical ~ilc[world].

  ~c[(mfc-ts term mfc state)]: returns the ~c[type-set] of ~c[term] in
  the current context; ~pl[type-set].

  ~c[(mfc-rw term obj equiv-info mfc state)]: returns the result of rewriting
  ~c[term] in the current context, ~c[mfc], with objective ~c[obj] and the
  equivalence relation described by ~c[equiv-info].  ~c[Obj] should be ~c[t],
  ~c[nil], or ~c[?], and describes your objective: try to show that ~c[term] is
  true, false, or anything.  ~c[Equiv-info] is either ~c[nil], ~c[t], a
  function symbol ~c[fn] naming a known equivalence relation, or a list of
  congruence rules.  ~c[Nil] means return a term that is ~c[equal] to ~c[term].
  ~c[T] means return a term that is propositionally equivalent (i.e., in the
  ~c[iff] sense) to ~c[term], while ~c[fn] means return a term
  ~c[fn]-equivalent to ~c[term].  The final case, which is intended only for
  advanced users, allows the specification of generated equivalence relations,
  as supplied to the ~c[geneqv] argument of ~c[rewrite].  Generally, if you
  wish to establish that ~c[term] is true in the current context, use the idiom
  ~bv[]
  (equal (mfc-rw term t t mfc state) *t*)
  ~ev[]
  The constant ~c[*t*] is set to the internal form of the constant term ~c[t],
  i.e., ~c['t].

  ~c[(mfc-rw+ term alist obj equiv-info mfc state)]: if ~c[alist] is ~c[nil]
  then this is equivalent to ~c[(mfc-rw term obj equiv-info mfc state)].
  However, the former takes an argument, ~c[alist], that binds variables to
  terms, and returns the result of rewriting ~c[term] under that ~c[alist],
  where this rewriting is as described for ~c[mfc-rw] above.  The function
  ~c[mfc-rw+] can be more efficient than ~c[mfc-rw|], because the terms in the
  binding alist have generally already been rewritten, and it can be
  inefficient to rewrite them again.  For example, consider a rewrite rule of
  the following form.
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and ...
                (syntaxp (... (mfc-rw `(bar ,x) ...) ...))
                ...)
           (equal (... x ...) ...))
  ~ev[]
  Here, ~c[x] is bound in the conclusion to the result of rewriting some term,
  say, ~c[tm].  Then the above call of ~c[mfc-rw] will rewrite ~c[tm], which is
  probably unnecessary.  So a preferable form of the rule above may be as
  follows, so that ~c[tm] is not further rewritten by ~c[mfc-rw+].
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and ...
                (syntaxp (... (mfc-rw+ '(bar v) `((v . ,x)) ...) ...))
                ...)
           (equal (... x ...) ...))
  ~ev[]
  However, you may find that the additional rewriting done by ~c[mfc-rw] is
  useful in some cases.

  ~c[(mfc-ap term mfc state)]: returns ~c[t] or ~c[nil] according to whether
  linear arithmetic can determine that ~c[term] is false.  To the cognoscenti:
  returns the contradiction flag produced by linearizing ~c[term] and adding it
  to the ~c[linear-pot-lst].

  During the execution of a metafunction by the theorem prover, the expressions
  above compute the results specified.  However, there are no axioms about the
  ~c[mfc-] function symbols: they are uninterpreted function symbols.  Thus, in
  the proof of the correctness of a metafunction, no information is available
  about the results of these functions.  Thus,
  ~em[these functions can be used for heuristic purposes only.]

  For example, your metafunction may use these functions to decide whether to
  perform a given transformation, but the transformation must be sound
  regardless of the value that your metafunction returns.  We illustrate this
  below.  It is sometimes possible to use the hypothesis metafunction,
  ~c[hyp-fn], to generate a sufficient hypothesis to justify the
  transformation.  The generated hypothesis might have already been ``proved''
  internally by your use of ~c[mfc-ts] or ~c[mfc-rw], but the system will have
  to prove it ``officially'' by relieving it.  We illustrate this below also.

  We conclude with a script that defines, verifies, and uses several extended
  metafunctions.  This script is based on one provided by Robert Krug, who was
  instrumental in the development of this style of metafunction and whose help
  we gratefully acknowledge.

  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (defevaluator ev ev-list
     ((g1 x1 ... xn_1)
      ...
      (gk x1 ... xn_k))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[ev] and ~c[ev]-list are new function symbols and ~c[g1], ..., ~c[gk] are
  old function symbols with the indicated number of formals, i.e.,
  each ~c[gi] has ~c[n_i] formals.

  This function provides a convenient way to constrain ~c[ev] and ~c[ev-list]
  to be mutually-recursive evaluator functions for the symbols ~c[g1],
  ..., ~c[gk].  Roughly speaking, an evaluator function for a fixed,
  finite set of function symbols is a restriction of the universal
  evaluator to terms composed of variables, constants, lambda
  expressions, and applications of the given functions.  However,
  evaluator functions are constrained rather than defined, so that the
  proof that a given metafunction is correct vis-a-vis a particular
  evaluator function can be lifted (by functional instantiation) to a
  proof that it is correct for any larger evaluator function.
  ~l[meta] for a discussion of metafunctions.

  ~c[Defevaluator] executes an ~ilc[encapsulate] after generating the
  appropriate ~ilc[defun] and ~ilc[defthm] events.  Perhaps the easiest way to
  understand what ~c[defevaluator] does is to execute the keyword command
  ~bv[]
  :trans1 (defevaluator evl evl-list ((length x) (member x y)))
  ~ev[]
  and inspect the output.  This trick is also useful in the rare case
  that the event fails because a hint is needed.  In that case, the
  output of ~c[:]~ilc[trans1] can be edited by adding hints, then
  submitted directly.

  Formally, ~c[ev] is said to be an ``evaluator function for ~c[g1],
  ..., ~c[gk], with mutually-recursive counterpart ~c[ev-list]'' iff
  ~c[ev] and ~c[ev-list] are constrained functions satisfying just the
  ~il[constraint]s discussed below.

  ~c[Ev] and ~c[ev-list] must satisfy ~il[constraint]s (1)-(4) and (k):

  ~l[table] for a general discussion of tables and the ~c[table]
  event used to manipulate tables.

  The ``~c[term-table]'' is used at the time a meta rule is checked for
  syntactic correctness.  Each proposed metafunction is run on each
  term in this table, and the result in each case is checked to make
  sure that it is a ~c[termp] in the current world.  In each case where
  this test fails, a warning is printed.

  Whenever a metafunction is run in support of the application of a
  meta rule, the result must be a term in the current world.  When the
  result is not a term, a hard error arises.  The ~c[term-table] is simply
  a means for providing feedback to the user at the time a meta rule
  is submitted, warning of the definite possibility that such a hard
  error will occur at some point in the future.

  The key used in ~c[term-table] is arbitrary.  The top-most value is
  always the one that is used; it is the entire list of terms to be
  considered.  Each must be a ~c[termp] in the current ACL2 world.~/")

  make a destructor elimination rule~/

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and how they are
  used to build rules from formulas.  Here we describe the class of ~c[:elim]
  rules, which is fundamentally quite different from the more common class of
  ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules.  Briefly put, a ~c[:rewrite] rule replaces
  instances of its left-hand side with corresponding instances of its
  right-hand side.  But an ~c[:elim] rule, on the other hand, has the effect of
  generalizing so-called ``destructor'' function applications to variables.  In
  essence, applicability of a ~c[:rewrite] rule is based on matching its
  left-hand side, while applicability of an ~c[:elim] rule is based on the
  presence of at least one destructor term.

  For example, a conjecture about ~c[(car x)] and ~c[(cdr x)] can be replaced
  by a conjecture about new variables ~c[x1] and ~c[x2], as shown in the
  following example.  (Run the command ~c[:mini-proveall] and search for
  ~c[CAR-CDR-ELIM] to see the full proof containing this excerpt.)
  ~bv[]
  Subgoal *1/1'
  (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP X)
                (TRUE-LISTP (REV (CDR X))))
           (TRUE-LISTP (APP (REV (CDR X)) (LIST (CAR X))))).

  The destructor terms (CAR X) and (CDR X) can be eliminated by using
  CAR-CDR-ELIM to replace X by (CONS X1 X2), (CAR X) by X1 and (CDR X)
  by X2.  This produces the following goal.

  Subgoal *1/1''
  (IMPLIES (AND (CONSP (CONS X1 X2))
                (TRUE-LISTP (REV X2)))
           (TRUE-LISTP (APP (REV X2) (LIST X1)))).

  This simplifies, using primitive type reasoning, to

  Subgoal *1/1'''
  (IMPLIES (TRUE-LISTP (REV X2))
           (TRUE-LISTP (APP (REV X2) (LIST X1)))).
  ~ev[]
  The resulting conjecture is often simpler and hence more amenable to proof.

  The application of an ~c[:elim] rule thus replaces a variable by a term that
  contains applications of so-called ``destructor'' functions to that variable.
  The example above is typical: the variable ~c[x] is replaced by the term
  ~c[(cons (car x) (cdr x))], which applies a so-called ``constructor''
  function, ~ilc[cons], to applications ~c[(car x)] and ~c[(cdr x)] of
  destructor functions ~ilc[car] and ~ilc[cdr] to that same variable, ~c[x].
  But that is only part of the story.  ACL2 then generalizes the destructor
  applications ~c[(car x)] and ~c[(cdr x)] to new variables ~c[x1] and ~c[x2],
  respectively, and ultimately the result is a simpler conjecture.

  More generally, the application of an ~c[:elim] rule replaces a variable by a
  term containing applications of destructors; there need not be a clear-cut
  notion of ``constructor.''  But the situation described above is typical, and
  we will focus on it, giving full details when we introduce the ``General
  Form'' below.

  The example above employs the following built-in ~c[:elim] rule named
  ~c[car-cdr-elim].
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (implies (consp x)                      when (car v) or (cdr v) appears
           (equal (cons (car x) (cdr x))  in a conjecture, and v is a
                  x))                     variable, consider replacing v by
                                          (cons a b), for two new variables
                                          a and b.

  Notice that the situation is complicated a bit by the fact that this
  replacement is only valid if the variable being replaced a cons structure.
  Thus, when ACL2 applies ~c[car-cdr-elim] to replace a variable ~c[v], it will
  split into two cases: one case in which ~c[(consp v)] is true, in which ~c[v]
  is replaced by ~c[(cons (car v) (cdr v))] and then ~c[(car v)] and
  ~c[(cdr v)] are generalized to new variables; and one case in which
  ~c[(consp v)] is false.  In practice, ~c[(consp v)] is often provable,
  perhaps even literally present as a hypotheses; then of course there is no
  need to introduce the second case.  That is why there is no such second case
  in the example above.

  You might find ~c[:elim] rules to be useful whenever you have in mind a data
  type that can be built up from its fields with a ``constructor'' function and
  whose fields can be accessed by corresponding ``destructor'' functions.  So
  for example, if you have a ``house'' data structure that represents a house
  in terms of its address, price, and color, you might have a rule like the
  following.
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (implies (house-p x)
           (equal (make-house (address x)
                              (price x)
                              (color x))
                  x))
  ~ev[]
  The application of such a rule is entirely analogous to the application of
  the rule ~c[car-cdr-elim] discussed above.  We discuss such rules and their
  application more carefully below.~/

  General Form:
  (implies hyp (equiv lhs x))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[equiv] is a known equivalence relation (~pl[defequiv]); ~c[x]
  is a variable symbol; and ~c[lhs] contains one or more terms (called
  ``destructor terms'') of the form ~c[(fn v1 ... vn)], where ~c[fn] is
  a function symbol and the ~c[vi] are distinct variable symbols,
  ~c[v1], ..., ~c[vn] include all the variable symbols in the formula,
  no ~c[fn] occurs in ~c[lhs] in more than one destructor term, and all
  occurrences of ~c[x] in ~c[lhs] are inside destructor terms.

  To use an ~c[:elim] rule, the theorem prover waits until a conjecture has
  been maximally simplified.  It then searches for an instance of some
  destructor term ~c[(fn v1 ... vn)] in the conjecture, where the instance for
  ~c[x] is some variable symbol, ~c[vi], and every occurrence of ~c[vi] outside
  the destructor terms is in an ~c[equiv]-hittable position.  If such an
  instance is found, then the theorem prover instantiates the ~c[:elim] formula
  as indicated by the destructor term matched; splits the conjecture into two
  goals, according to whether the instantiated hypothesis, ~c[hyp], holds; and
  in the case that it does hold, generalizes all the instantiated destructor
  terms in the conjecture to new variables and then replaces ~c[vi] in the
  conjecture by the generalized instantiated ~c[lhs].  An occurrence of ~c[vi]
  is ``~c[equiv]-hittable'' if sufficient congruence rules (~pl[defcong]) have
  been proved to establish that the propositional value of the clause is not
  altered by replacing that occurrence of ~c[vi] by some ~c[equiv]-equivalent
  term.

  If an ~c[:elim] rule is not applied when you think it should have been,
  and the rule uses an equivalence relation, ~c[equiv], other than ~c[equal],
  it is most likely that there is an occurrence of the variable that is not
  ~c[equiv]-hittable.  Easy occurrences to overlook are those in
  the governing hypotheses.  If you see an unjustified occurrence of the
  variable, you must prove the appropriate congruence rule to allow the
  ~c[:elim] to fire.

  Further examples of how ACL2 ~c[:elim] rules are used may be found in the
  corresponding discussion of ``Elimation of Destructors'' for Nqthm, in
  Section 10.4 of A Computational Logic Handbook.")

  To specify the term whose type (~pl[type-set]) is described by

  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (implies hyps
           (or type-restriction1-on-pat
               ...

               (equal pat var1)
               ...
               (equal pat varj)))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[pat] is the application of some function symbol to some
  arguments, each ~c[type-restrictioni-on-pat] is a term involving ~c[pat] and
  containing no variables outside of the occurrences of ~c[pat], and each
  ~c[vari] is one of the variables of ~c[pat].  Generally speaking, the
  ~c[type-restriction] terms ought to be terms that inform us as to the
  type of ~c[pat].  Ideally, they should be ``primitive recognizing
  expressions'' about ~c[pat]; ~pl[compound-recognizer].

  If the ~c[:typed-term] is not provided in the rule class object, it is
  computed heuristically by looking for a term in the conclusion whose
  type is being restricted.  An error is caused if no such term is
  found.

  Roughly speaking, the effect of adding such a rule is to inform the
  ACL2 typing mechanism that ~c[pat] has the type described by the
  conclusion, when the hypotheses are true.  In particular, the type
  of ~c[pat] is within the union of the types described by the several
  disjuncts.  The ``type described by'' ~c[(equal pat vari)] is the type
  of ~c[vari].

  More operationally, when asked to determine the type of a term that
  is an instance of ~c[pat], ACL2 will first attempt to establish the
  hypotheses.  ~st[This is done by type reasoning alone, not rewriting!]
  Of course, if some hypothesis is to be forced, it is so
  treated; ~pl[force] and ~pl[case-split].  So-called free variables in
  hypotheses are treated specially; ~pl[free-variables].  Provided the
  hypotheses are established by type reasoning, ACL2 then unions the
  types described by the ~c[type-restrictioni-on-pat] terms together
  with the types of those subexpressions of ~c[pat] identified by the
  ~c[vari].  The final type computed for a term is the intersection of
  the types implied by each applicable rule.  Type prescription rules
  may be disabled.

  Because only type reasoning is used to establish the hypotheses of
  ~c[:type-prescription] rules, some care must be taken with the
  hypotheses.  Suppose, for example, that the non-recursive function
  ~c[my-statep] is defined as
  ~bv[]
    (defun my-statep (x)
      (and (true-listp x)
           (equal (length x) 2)))
  ~ev[]
  and suppose ~c[(my-statep s)] occurs as a hypothesis of a
  ~c[:type-prescription] rule that is being considered for use in the
  proof attempt for a conjecture with the hypothesis ~c[(my-statep s)].
  Since the hypothesis in the conjecture is rewritten, it will become
  the conjunction of ~c[(true-listp s)] and ~c[(equal (length s) 2)].
  Those two terms will be assumed to have type ~c[t] in the context in
  which the ~c[:type-prescription] rule is tried.  But type reasoning will
  be unable to deduce that ~c[(my-statep s)] has type ~c[t] in this
  context.  Thus, either ~c[my-statep] should be disabled
  (~pl[disable]) during the proof attempt or else the occurrence
  of ~c[(my-statep s)] in the ~c[:type-prescription] rule should be
  replaced by the conjunction into which it rewrites.

  While this example makes it clear how non-recursive predicates can
  cause problems, non-recursive functions in general can cause
  problems.  For example, if ~c[(mitigate x)] is defined to be
  ~c[(if (rationalp x) (1- x) x)] then the hypothesis
  ~c[(pred (mitigate s))] in the conjecture will rewrite, opening
  ~c[mitigate] and splitting the conjecture into two subgoals, one in
  which ~c[(rationalp s)] and ~c[(pred (1- x))] are assumed and the
  other in which ~c[(not (rationalp s))] and ~c[(pred x)] are assumed.
  But ~c[(pred (mitigate s))] will not be typed as ~c[t] in either of
  these contexts.  The moral is: beware of non-recursive functions
  occuring in the hypotheses of ~c[:type-prescription] rules.

  Because of the freedom one has in forming the conclusion of a
  type-prescription, we have to use heuristics to recover the pattern,
  ~c[pat], whose type is being specified.  In some cases our heuristics
  may not identify the intended term and the ~c[:type-prescription]
  rule will be rejected as illegal because the conclusion is not of
  the correct form.  When this happens you may wish to specify the ~c[pat]
  directly.  This may be done by using a suitable rule class token.
  In particular, when the token ~c[:type-prescription] is used it means
  ACL2 is to compute pat with its heuristics; otherwise the token
  should be of the form ~c[(:type-prescription :typed-term pat)], where
  ~c[pat] is the term whose type is being specified.

  The defun event may generate a ~c[:type-prescription] rule.  Suppose
  ~c[fn] is the name of the function concerned.  Then
  ~c[(:type-prescription fn)] is the rune given to the
  type-prescription, if any, generated for ~c[fn] by ~ilc[defun].  (The
  trivial rule, saying ~c[fn] has unknown type, is not stored, but
  ~ilc[defun] still allocates the rune and the corollary of this rune is
  known to be ~c[t].)~/")

; information from basic-term.  But the only var in basic-term is new
; so the hyps don't help much.  The idea was to permit lemmas like
; (implies (rationalp x) (<= 0 (* x x))).  Note that the guard for <=
; is satisfied only if we know that the product is rational, which we
; can deduce from the hyp.  But when we try to process that lemma, the
; typed-term in generalized away, e.g., (implies (rationalp x) (<= 0
; Z)).  Thus, the hyps don't help: the only var in basic-term is
; new-var.  You could conjoin hyps and concl1 and THEN generalize the
; typed-term to new-var, thereby linking the occurrences of typed-term
; in the hyps to those in the concl.  But this is very unhelpful
; because it encourages the creation of lemmas that contain the
; typed-term in the hyps.  That is bad because type-set then
; infinitely backchains.  In the face of these difficulties, we have
; reverted back to the simplest treatment of type-prescription lemmas.

; compound-recognizer was actually t.  In that case, the forced hyp
; would necessarily involve new-var, since that is the only argument
; to a compound recognizer.  It would be interesting to see a living

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and
  how they are used to build rules from formulas.  An example
  ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula from which a ~c[:equivalence] rule might be built is
  as follows.  (We assume that ~c[r-equal] has been defined.)
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (and (booleanp (r-equal x y))
       (r-equal x x)
       (implies (r-equal x y) (r-equal y x))
       (implies (and (r-equal x y)
                     (r-equal y z))
                (r-equal x z))).
  ~ev[]
  Also ~pl[defequiv].~/
  ~bv[]
  General Form:
  (and (booleanp (equiv x y))
       (equiv x x)
       (implies (equiv x y) (equiv y x))
       (implies (and (equiv x y)
                     (equiv y z))
                (equiv x z)))
  ~ev[]
  except that the order of the conjuncts and terms and the choice of
  variable symbols is unimportant.  The effect of such a rule is to
  identify ~c[equiv] as an equivalence relation.  Note that only Boolean
  2-place function symbols can be treated as equivalence relations.
  ~l[congruence] and ~pl[refinement] for closely related
  concepts.

  The macro form ~c[(defequiv equiv)] is an abbreviation for a ~ilc[defthm] of
  rule-class ~c[:equivalence] that establishes that ~c[equiv] is an
  equivalence relation.  It generates the formula shown above.
  ~l[defequiv].

  When ~c[equiv] is marked as an equivalence relation, its reflexivity,
  symmetry, and transitivity are built into the system in a deeper way
  than via ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules.  More importantly, after ~c[equiv] has been
  shown to be an equivalence relation, lemmas about ~c[equiv], e.g.,
  ~bv[]
  (implies hyps (equiv lhs rhs)),
  ~ev[]
  when stored as ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules, cause the system to rewrite certain
  occurrences of (instances of) ~c[lhs] to (instances of) ~c[rhs].  Roughly
  speaking, an occurrence of ~c[lhs] in the ~c[kth] argument of some
  ~c[fn]-expression, ~c[(fn ... lhs' ...)], can be rewritten to produce
  ~c[(fn ...  rhs' ...)], provided the system ``knows'' that the value
  of ~c[fn] is unaffected by ~c[equiv]-substitution in the ~c[kth]
  argument.  Such knowledge is communicated to the system via
  ``congruence lemmas.''

  For example, suppose that ~c[r-equal] is known to be an equivalence
  relation.  The ~c[:]~ilc[congruence] lemma
  ~bv[]
  (implies (r-equal s1 s2)
           (equal (fn s1 n) (fn s2 n)))
  ~ev[]
  informs the rewriter that, while rewriting the first argument of
  ~c[fn]-expressions, it is permitted to use ~c[r-equal] rewrite-rules.
  ~l[congruence] for details about ~c[:]~ilc[congruence] lemmas.
  Interestingly, congruence lemmas are automatically created when an
  equivalence relation is stored, saying that either of the
  equivalence relation's arguments may be replaced by an equivalent
  argument.  That is, if the equivalence relation is ~c[fn], we store
  congruence rules that state the following fact:
  ~bv[]
  (implies (and (fn x1 y1)
                (fn x2 y2))
           (iff (fn x1 x2) (fn y1 y2)))
  ~ev[]
  Another aspect of equivalence relations is that of ``refinement.''
  We say ~c[equiv1] ``refines'' ~c[equiv2] iff ~c[(equiv1 x y)] implies
  ~c[(equiv2 x y)].  ~c[:]~ilc[refinement] rules permit you to establish such
  connections between your equivalence relations.  The value of
  refinements is that if the system is trying to rewrite something
  while maintaining ~c[equiv2] it is permitted to use as a ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite]
  rule any refinement of ~c[equiv2].  Thus, if ~c[equiv1] is a
  refinement of ~c[equiv2] and there are ~c[equiv1] rewrite-rules
  available, they can be brought to bear while maintaining ~c[equiv2].
  ~l[refinement].

  The system initially has knowledge of two equivalence relations,
  equality, denoted by the symbol ~ilc[equal], and propositional
  equivalence, denoted by ~ilc[iff].  ~ilc[Equal] is known to be a refinement of
  all equivalence relations and to preserve equality across all
  arguments of all functions.

  Typically there are five steps involved in introducing and using a
  new equivalence relation, equiv.~bq[]

  (1) Define ~c[equiv],

  (2) prove the ~c[:equivalence] lemma about ~c[equiv],

  (3) prove the ~c[:]~ilc[congruence] lemmas that show where ~c[equiv] can be used
  to maintain known relations,

  (4) prove the ~c[:]~ilc[refinement] lemmas that relate ~c[equiv] to known
  relations other than equal, and

  (5) develop the theory of conditional ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules that drive
  equiv rewriting.

  ~eq[]More will be written about this as we develop the techniques.  For
  now, here is an example that shows how to make use of equivalence
  relations in rewriting.

  Among the theorems proved below is
  ~bv[]
  (defthm insert-sort-is-id 
    (perm (insert-sort x) x))
  ~ev[]
  Here ~c[perm] is defined as usual with ~c[delete] and is proved to be an
  equivalence relation and to be a congruence relation for ~ilc[cons] and
  ~ilc[member].

  Then we prove the lemma
  ~bv[]
  (defthm insert-is-cons
    (perm (insert a x) (cons a x)))
  ~ev[]
  which you must think of as you would ~c[(insert a x) = (cons a x)].

  Now prove ~c[(perm (insert-sort x) x)].  The base case is trivial.  The
  induction step is
  ~bv[]
     (consp x)
   & (perm (insert-sort (cdr x)) (cdr x))

  -> (perm (insert-sort x) x).
  ~ev[]
  Opening ~c[insert-sort] makes the conclusion be
  ~bv[]
     (perm (insert (car x) (insert-sort (cdr x))) x).
  ~ev[]
  Then apply the induction hypothesis (rewriting ~c[(insert-sort (cdr x))]
  to ~c[(cdr x)]), to make the conclusion be
  ~bv[]
  (perm (insert (car x) (cdr x)) x)
  ~ev[]
  Then apply ~c[insert-is-cons] to get ~c[(perm (cons (car x) (cdr x)) x)].
  But we know that ~c[(cons (car x) (cdr x))] is ~c[x], so we get ~c[(perm x x)]
  which is trivial, since ~c[perm] is an equivalence relation.

  Here are the events.

; coarsenings of 'equal, which is the only other equivalence relation
; that we know is a refinement of this new one.  The coarsenings of
; 'equal is thus the list of all known equivalence relations.  The car of
; the 'coarsenings property for an equivalence relation fn is always
; eq to fn itself.  However, subsequent relations are listed in
; arbitrary order.

; If fn is not "obviously" Boolean in the sense that type-set reports
; that it is Boolean, we store a type-prescription rule for it.  This is
; usually unnecessary when fn is defined.  But on the off chance that its
; Boolean nature was missed by DEFUN or -- more likely -- when fn is a
; constrained function that is undefined in this world, we often need
; this fact.

; We also add a 'congruences property for fn.  See the essay on
; equivalence, refinements, and congruence-based rewriting.
; The property that we add states that the equality of two fn expressions
; is maintained by maintaining fn in both arguments.
; That is

  Suppose we have the ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule

  Suppose further we have established that bag-equality refines
  set-equality.  Then when we are simplifying ~ilc[append] expressions while

  Equality is known to be a refinement of all equivalence relations.
  The transitive closure of the refinement relation is maintained, so
  if ~c[set-equality], say, is shown to be a refinement of some third
  sense of equivalence, then ~c[bag-equality] will automatially be known
  as a refinement of that third equivalence.

  ~c[:refinement] lemmas cannot be disabled.  That is, once one

; As noted in the essay on equivalence, refinements, and

; via the 'coarsenings property, for efficiency reasons explained in

; a coarsening of equiv1.  We therefore wish to add equiv2 to the
; coarsening property of equiv1.  However, as noted in the essay, the
; coarsening properties are kept closed under transitivity.  So we need
; a transitive closure operation.

; Rather that try to implement this closure operation directly on the
; property-list world, where we would repeatedly extend the 'coarsenings
; properties of the affected equivs, we have decided on a more modular and
; elegant approach.  We will simply collect all the coarsening properties

                   (fn x1... xk-equiv ...xn)))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[equiv1] and ~c[equiv2] are known equivalence relations, ~c[fn] is an
  ~c[n-ary] function symbol and the ~c[xi] and ~c[xk-equiv] are all distinct
  variables.  The effect of such a rule is to record that the
  ~c[equiv2]-equivalence of ~c[fn]-expressions can be maintained if, while
  rewriting the ~c[kth] argument position, ~c[equiv1]-equivalence is
  maintained.  ~l[equivalence] for a general discussion of the
  issues.  We say that ~c[equiv2], above, is the ``outside equivalence''
  in the rule and ~c[equiv1] is the ``inside equivalence for the ~c[k]th
  argument''

  The macro form ~c[(defcong equiv1 equiv2 (fn x1 ... x1) k)] is an
  abbreviation for a ~ilc[defthm] of rule-class ~c[:congruence] that attempts to
  establish that ~c[equiv2] is maintained by maintaining ~c[equiv1] in ~c[fn]'s
  ~c[k]th argument.  The ~ilc[defcong] macro automatically generates the general
  formula shown above.  ~l[defcong].

  The ~c[memb] example above tells us that ~c[(memb e x)] is propositionally
  equivalent to ~c[(memb e y)], provided ~c[x] and ~c[y] are ~c[set-equal].  The
  outside equivalence is ~ilc[iff] and the inside equivalence for the second
  argument is ~c[set-equal].  If we see a ~c[memb] expression in a
  propositional context, e.g., as a literal of a clause or test of an
  ~ilc[if] (but not, for example, as an argument to ~ilc[cons]), we can rewrite
  its second argument maintaining ~c[set-equality].  For example, a rule
  stating the commutativity of ~ilc[append] (modulo set-equality) could be
  applied in this context.  Since equality is a refinement of all
  equivalence relations, all equality rules are always available.
  ~l[refinement].

  All known ~c[:congruence] rules about a given outside equivalence and ~c[fn]
  can be used independently.  That is, consider two ~c[:congruence] rules
  with the same outside equivalence, ~c[equiv], and about the same
  function ~c[fn].  Suppose one says that ~c[equiv1] is the inside equivalence
  for the first argument and the other says ~c[equiv2] is the inside
  equivalence for the second argument.  Then ~c[(fn a b)] is ~c[equiv]
  ~c[(fn a' b')] provided ~c[a] is ~c[equiv1] to ~c[a'] and ~c[b] is ~c[equiv2]
  to ~c[b'].  This is an easy consequence of the transitivity of
  ~c[equiv].  It permits you to think independently about the inside
  equivalences.

  Furthermore, it is possible that more than one inside equivalence
  for a given argument slot will maintain a given outside equivalence.
  For example, ~c[(length a)] is equal to ~c[(length a')] if ~c[a] and ~c[a'] are
  related either by ~c[list-equal] or by ~ilc[string-equal].  You may prove two
  (or more) ~c[:congruence] rules for the same slot of a function.  The
  result is that the system uses a new, ``generated'' equivalence
  relation for that slot with the result that rules of both (or all)
  kinds are available while rewriting.

  ~c[:Congruence] rules can be disabled.  For example, if you have two
  different inside equivalences for a given argument position and you
  find that the ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules for one are unexpectedly preventing the
  application of the desired rule, you can disable the rule that
  introduced the unwanted inside equivalence.

  More will be written about this as we develop the techniques.")

; means term states that ``equiv2 is preserved by equiv1 in the kth
; argument of fn.''  If the term is not a :CONGRUENCE rule, the second
; is a tilde-@ message explaining why.  See the essay on equivalence,
; refinements, and congruence-based rewriting for details.

; :CONGRUENCE lemmas are of the form

; (implies (equiv1 xk yk)
;          (equiv2 (fn x1 ... xk ... xn) (fn x1 ... yk ... xn)))

; where fn is a function symbol, all the xi and yk are distinct
; variables and equiv1 and the equiv2 are equivalence relations.
; Such a lemma is read as ``equiv2 is preserved by equiv1 in the kth
; argument of fn.''

; We do not actually cause an error because this function is sometimes
; called when STATE is unavailable.  We combine the recognition of the
; :CONGRUENCE lemma with the construction of the 4-tuple describing it
; because the two are so intermingled that it seemed dubious to
; separate them into two functions.

  ~l[rule-classes] for a general discussion of rule classes and how they are
  used to build rules from formulas.  An example ~c[:]~ilc[corollary] formula
  from which a ~c[:definition] rule might be built is:
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (implies (true-listp x)
           (equal (len x)
                  (if (null x)
                      0
                      (if (null (cdr x))
                          1
                          (+ 2 (len (cddr x)))))))~/

  General Form:
  (implies hyp (equiv (fn a1 ... an) body))
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[equiv] is an equivalence relation and ~c[fn] is a function
  symbol other than ~ilc[if], ~ilc[hide], ~ilc[force] or ~ilc[case-split].  Such
  rules allow ``alternative'' definitions of ~c[fn] to be proved as
  theorems but used as definitions.  These rules are not true
  ``definitions'' in the sense that they (a) cannot introduce new
  function symbols and (b) do not have to be terminating recursion
  schemes.  They are just conditional rewrite rules that are
  controlled the same way we control recursive definitions.  We call
  these ``definition rules'' or ``generalized definitions''.

  Consider the general form above.  Generalized definitions are stored
  among the ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rules for the function ``defined,'' ~c[fn] above, but
  the procedure for applying them is a little different.  During
  rewriting, instances of ~c[(fn a1 ... an)] are replaced by corresponding
  instances of ~c[body] provided the ~c[hyp]s can be established as for a
  ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule and the result of rewriting ~c[body] satisfies the
  criteria for function expansion.  There are two primary criteria,
  either of which permits expansion.  The first is that the
  ``recursive'' calls of ~c[fn] in the rewritten body have arguments that
  already occur in the goal conjecture.  The second is that the
  ``controlling'' arguments to ~c[fn] are simpler in the rewritten body.

  The notions of ``recursive call'' and ``controllers'' are
  complicated by the provisions for mutually recursive definitions.
  Consider a ``clique'' of mutually recursive definitions.  Then a
  ``recursive call'' is a call to any function defined in the clique
  and an argument is a ``controller'' if it is involved in the measure
  that decreases in all recursive calls.  These notions are precisely
  defined by the definitional principle and do not necessarily make
  sense in the context of generalized definitional equations as
  implemented here.

  But because the heuristics governing the use of generalized
  definitions require these notions, it is generally up to the user to
  specify which calls in body are to be considered recursive and what
  the controlling arguments are.  This information is specified in the
  ~c[:clique] and ~c[:controller-alist] fields of the ~c[:definition] rule class.

  The ~c[:clique] field is the list of function symbols to be considered
  recursive calls of ~c[fn].  In the case of a non-recursive definition,
  the ~c[:clique] field is empty; in a singly recursive definition, it
  should consist of the singleton list containing ~c[fn]; otherwise it
  should be a list of all of the functions in the mutually recursive
  clique with this definition of ~c[fn].

  If the ~c[:clique] field is not provided it defaults to ~c[nil] if ~c[fn] does
  not occur as a function symbol in ~c[body] and it defaults to the
  singleton list containing ~c[fn] otherwise.  Thus, ~c[:clique] must be
  supplied by the user only when the generalized definition rule is to
  be treated as one of several in a mutually recursive clique.

  The ~c[:controller-alist] is an alist that maps each function symbol in
  the ~c[:clique] to a mask specifying which arguments are considered
  controllers.  The mask for a given member of the clique, ~c[fn], must be
  a list of ~c[t]'s and ~c[nil]'s of length equal to the arity of ~c[fn].  A ~c[t]
  should be in each argument position that is considered a
  ``controller'' of the recursion.  For a function admitted under the
  principle of definition, an argument controls the recursion if it is
  one of the arguments measured in the termination argument for the
  function.  But in generalized definition rules, the user is free to
  designate any subset of the arguments as controllers.  Failure to
  choose wisely may result in the ``infinite expansion'' of
  definitional rules but cannot render ACL2 unsound since the rule
  being misused is a theorem.

  If the ~c[:controller-alist] is omitted it can sometimes be defaulted
  automatically by the system.  If the ~c[:clique] is ~c[nil], the
  ~c[:controller-alist] defaults to ~c[nil].  If the ~c[:clique] is a singleton
  containing ~c[fn], the ~c[:controller-alist] defaults to the controller
  alist computed by ~c[(defun fn args body)].  If the ~c[:clique] contains
  more than one function, the user must supply the ~c[:controller-alist]
  specifying the controllers for each function in the clique.  This is
  necessary since the system cannot determine and thus cannot analyze
  the other definitional equations to be included in the clique.

  For example, suppose ~c[fn1] and ~c[fn2] have been defined one way and it is
  desired to make ``alternative'' mutually recursive definitions
  available to the rewriter.  Then one would prove two theorems and
  store each as a ~c[:definition] rule.  These two theorems would exhibit
  equations ``defining'' ~c[fn1] and ~c[fn2] in terms of each other.  No
  provision is here made for exhibiting these two equations as a
  system of equations.  One is proved and then the other.  It just so
  happens that the user intends them to be treated as mutually
  recursive definitions.  To achieve this end, both ~c[:definition] rules
  should specify the ~c[:clique] ~c[(fn1 fn2)] and should specify a suitable
  ~c[:controller-alist].  If, for example, the new definition of ~c[fn1] is
  controlled by its first argument and the new definition of ~c[fn2] is
  controlled by its second and third (and they each take three
  arguments) then a suitable ~c[:controller-alist] would be
  ~c[((fn1 t nil nil) (fn2 nil t t))].  The order of the pairs in the
  alist is unimportant, but there must be a pair for each function in
  the clique.

  Inappropriate heuristic advice via ~c[:clique] and ~c[:controller-alist] can
  cause ``infinite expansion'' of generalized definitions, but cannot
  render ACL2 unsound.

  Note that the actual definition of ~c[fn1] has the runic name
  ~c[(:definition fn1)].  The runic name of the alternative definition is
  ~c[(:definition lemma)], where ~c[lemma] is the name given to the event that
  created the generalized ~c[:definition] rule.  This allows theories to
  switch between various ``definitions'' of the functions.

  By default, a ~c[:definition] rule establishes the so-called ``body'' of a
  function.  The body is used by ~c[:expand] ~il[hints], and it is also used
  heuristically by the theorem prover's preprocessing (the initial
  simplification using ``simple'' rules that is controlled by the
  ~c[preprocess] symbol in ~c[:do-not] ~il[hints]), induction analysis, and the
  determination for when to warn about non-recursive functions in rules.  The
  body is also used by some heuristics involving whether a function is
  recursively defined, and by the ~c[expand], ~c[x], and ~c[x-dumb] commands of
  the ~il[proof-checker].

  ~l[rule-classes] for a discussion of the optional field ~c[:install-body] of
  ~c[:definition] rules, which controls whether a ~c[:definition] rule is used
  as described in the paragraph above.  Note that even if ~c[:install-body nil]
  is supplied, the rewriter will still rewrite with the ~c[:definition] rule;
  in that case, ACL2 just won't install a new body for the top function symbol
  of the left-hand side of the rule, which for example affects the application
  ~c[:expand] hints as described in the preceding paragraph.  Also
  ~pl[set-body] and ~pl[show-bodies] for how to change the body of a function
  symbol.

  Note only that if you prove a definition rule for function ~c[foo], say,
  ~c[foo-new-def], you will need to refer to that definition as ~c[foo-new-def]
  or as ~c[(:DEFINITION foo-new-def)].  That is because a ~c[:definition] rule
  does not change the meaning of the symbol ~c[foo] for ~c[:use] ~il[hints],
  nor does it change the meaning of the symbol ~c[foo] in theory expressions;
  ~pl[theories], in particular the discussion there of runic designators.
  Similarly ~c[:]~ilc[pe] ~c[foo] and ~c[:]~ilc[pf] ~c[foo] will still show the
  original definition of ~c[foo].

  The definitional principle, ~ilc[defun], actually adds ~c[:definition]
  rules.  Thus the handling of generalized definitions is exactly the
  same as for ``real'' definitions because no distinction is made in
  the implementation.  Suppose ~c[(fn x y)] is ~ilc[defun]'d to be
  ~c[body].  Note that ~ilc[defun] (or ~ilc[defuns] or ~ilc[mutual-recursion])
  can compute the clique for ~c[fn] from the syntactic presentation and
  it can compute the controllers from the termination analysis.
  Provided the definition is admissible, ~ilc[defun] adds the
  ~c[:definition] rule ~c[(equal (fn x y) body)].~/")

  make a rule that suggests a certain induction~/
  ~bv[]
  Example:
  (:induction :corollary t  ; the theorem proved is irrelevant!
              :pattern (* 1/2 i)
              :condition (and (integerp i) (>= i 0))

  ~ev[]~/

  In ACL2, as in Nqthm, the functions in a conjecture ``suggest'' the
  inductions considered by the system.  Because every recursive
  function must be admitted with a justification in terms of a measure
  that decreases in a well-founded way on a given set of
  ``controlling'' arguments, every recursive function suggests a dual
  induction scheme that ``unwinds'' the function from a given
  application.

  For example, since ~ilc[append] (actually ~ilc[binary-append], but we'll ignore
  the distinction here) decomposes its first argument by successive
  ~ilc[cdr]s as long as it is a non-~c[nil] true list, the induction scheme
  suggested by ~c[(append x y)] has a base case supposing ~c[x] to be either
  not a true list or to be ~c[nil] and then has an induction step in which
  the induction hypothesis is obtained by replacing ~c[x] by ~c[(cdr x)].
  This substitution decreases the same measure used to justify the
  definition of ~ilc[append].  Observe that an induction scheme is suggested
  by a recursive function application only if the controlling actuals
  are distinct variables, a condition that is sufficient to ensure
  that the ``substitution'' used to create the induction hypothesis is
  indeed a substitution and that it drives down a certain measure.  In
  particular, ~c[(append (foo x) y)] does not suggest an induction
  unwinding ~ilc[append] because the induction scheme suggested by
  ~c[(append x y)] requires that we substitute ~c[(cdr x)] for ~c[x] and
  we cannot do that if ~c[x] is not a variable symbol.

  Once ACL2 has collected together all the suggested induction schemes
  it massages them in various ways, combining some to simultaneously
  unwind certain cliques of functions and vetoing others because they
  ``flaw'' others.  We do not further discuss the induction heuristics
  here; the interested reader should see Chapter XIV of A
  Computational Logic (Boyer and Moore, Academic Press, 1979) which
  represents a fairly complete description of the induction heuristics
  of ACL2.

  However, unlike Nqthm, ACL2 provides a means by which the user can
  elaborate the rules under which function applications suggest
  induction schemes.  Such rules are called ~c[:induction] rules.  The
  definitional principle automatically creates an ~c[:induction] rule,
  named ~c[(:induction fn)], for each admitted recursive function, ~c[fn].  It
  is this rule that links applications of ~c[fn] to the induction scheme
  it suggests.  Disabling ~c[(:induction fn)] will prevent ~c[fn] from
  suggesting the induction scheme derived from its recursive
  definition.  It is possible for the user to create additional
  ~c[:induction] rules by using the ~c[:induction] rule class in ~ilc[defthm].

  Technically we are ``overloading'' ~ilc[defthm] by using it in the
  creation of ~c[:induction] rules because no theorem need be proved to
  set up the heuristic link represented by an ~c[:induction] rule.
  However, since ~ilc[defthm] is generally used to create rules and
  rule-class objects are generally used to specify the exact form of
  each rule, we maintain that convention and introduce the notion of
  an ~c[:induction] rule.  An ~c[:induction] rule can be created from any
  lemma whatsoever.
  ~bv[]
  General Form of an :induction Lemma or Corollary:
  T

  General Form of an :induction rule-class:
  (:induction :pattern pat-term
              :condition cond-term
              :scheme scheme-term)
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[pat-term], ~c[cond-term], and ~c[scheme-term] are all terms, ~c[pat-term]
  is the application of a function symbol, ~c[fn], ~c[scheme-term] is the
  application of a function symbol, ~c[rec-fn], that suggests an
  induction, and, finally, every free variable of ~c[cond-term] and
  ~c[scheme-term] is a free variable of ~c[pat-term].  We actually check that
  ~c[rec-fn] is either recursively defined ~-[] so that it suggests the
  induction that is intrinsic to its recursion ~-[] or else that another
  ~c[:induction] rule has been proved linking a call of ~c[rec-fn] as the
  ~c[:pattern] to some scheme.

  The induction rule created is used as follows.  When an instance of
  the ~c[:pattern] term occurs in a conjecture to be proved by induction
  and the corresponding instance of the ~c[:condition] term is known to be
  non-~c[nil] (by type reasoning alone), the corresponding instance of the
  ~c[:scheme] term is created and the rule ``suggests'' the induction, if
  any, suggested by that term.  If ~c[rec-fn] is recursive, then the
  suggestion is the one that unwinds that recursion.

  Consider, for example, the example given above,
  ~bv[]
  (:induction :pattern (* 1/2 i)
              :condition (and (integerp i) (>= i 0))
              :scheme (recursion-by-sub2 i)).
  ~ev[]
  In this example, we imagine that ~c[recursion-by-sub2] is the
  function:
  ~bv[]
  (defun recursion-by-sub2 (i)
    (if (and (integerp i)
             (< 1 i))
        (recursion-by-sub2 (- i 2))
        t))
  ~ev[]
  Observe that this function recursively decomposes its integer
  argument by subtracting ~c[2] from it repeatedly and stops when the
  argument is ~c[1] or less.  The value of the function is irrelevant; it
  is its induction scheme that concerns us.  The induction scheme
  suggested by ~c[(recursion-by-sub2 i)] is
  ~bv[]
  (and (implies (not (and (integerp i) (< 1 i)))   ; base case
                (:p i))
       (implies (and (and (integerp i) (< 1 i))    ; induction step
                     (:p (- i 2)))
                (:p i)))
  ~ev[]
  We can think of the base case as covering two situations.  The
  first is when ~c[i] is not an integer.  The second is when the integer ~c[i]
  is ~c[0] or ~c[1].  In the base case we must prove ~c[(:p i)] without further
  help.  The induction step deals with those integer ~c[i] greater than ~c[1],
  and inductively assumes the conjecture for ~c[i-2] while proving it for
  ~c[i].  Let us call this scheme ``induction on ~c[i] by twos.''

  Suppose the above ~c[:induction] rule has been added.  Then an
  occurrence of, say, ~c[(* 1/2 k)] in a conjecture to be proved by
  induction would suggest, via this rule, an induction on ~c[k] by twos,
  provided ~c[k] was known to be a nonnegative integer.  This is because
  the induction rule's ~c[:pattern] is matched in the conjecture, its
  ~c[:condition] is satisfied, and the ~c[:scheme] suggested by the rule is
  that derived from ~c[(recursion-by-sub2 k)], which is induction on ~c[k] by
  twos.  Similarly, the term ~c[(* 1/2 (length l))] would suggest no
  induction via this rule, even though the rule ``fires'' because it
  creates the ~c[:scheme] ~c[(recursion-by-sub2 (length l))] which suggests no
  inductions unwinding ~c[recursion-by-sub2] (since the controlling
  argument of ~c[recursion-by-sub2] in this ~c[:scheme] is not a variable
  symbol).

  Continuing this example one step further illustrates the utility of
  ~c[:induction] rules.  We could define the function ~c[recursion-by-cddr]
  that suggests the induction scheme decomposing its ~ilc[consp] argument
  two ~ilc[cdr]s at a time.  We could then add the ~c[:induction] rule linking
  ~c[(* 1/2 (length x))] to ~c[(recursion-by-cddr x)] and arrange for
  ~c[(* 1/2 (length l))] to suggest induction on ~c[l] by ~ilc[cddr].

  Observe that ~c[:induction] rules require no proofs to be done.  Such a
  rule is merely a heuristic link between the ~c[:pattern] term, which may
  occur in conjectures to be proved by induction, and the ~c[:scheme]
  term, from which an induction scheme may be derived.  Hence, when an
  ~c[:induction] rule-class is specified in a ~ilc[defthm] event, the theorem
  proved is irrelevant.  The easiest theorem to prove is, of course,
  ~c[t].  Thus, we suggest that when an ~c[:induction] rule is to be created,
  the following form be used:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm name T
    :rule-classes ((:induction :pattern pat-term
                               :condition cond-term
                               :scheme scheme-term)))
  ~ev[]
  The name of the rule created is ~c[(:induction name)].  When that rune
  is disabled the heuristic link between ~c[pat-term] and ~c[scheme-term] is
  broken.")

  containing ~c[x] as a free variable that ACL2 currently uses to
  recognize ~ilc[type-set] ~c[n].  For a given ~c[n], the exact form of ~c[old-expr] is
  generated by
  ~bv[]
  (convert-type-set-to-term 'x n (ens state) (w state) nil)].
  ~ev[]

  If the ~c[:]~ilc[type-set] field of the rule-class is omitted, we attempt to
  compute it from the right-hand side, ~c[old-expr], of the corollary.
  That computation is done by ~c[type-set-implied-by-term]
  (~pl[type-set]).  However, it is possible that the type-set we
  compute from ~c[lhs] does not have the required property that when
  inverted with ~c[convert-type-set-to-term] the result is ~c[lhs].  If you
  omit ~c[:]~ilc[type-set] and an error is caused because ~c[lhs] has the incorrect
  form, you should manually specify both ~c[:]~ilc[type-set] and the ~c[lhs]
  generated by ~c[convert-type-set-to-term].

  The rule generated will henceforth make ~c[new-expr] be the term used by
  ACL2 to recognize type-set ~c[n].  If this rule is created by a ~ilc[defthm]
  event named ~c[name] then the rune of the rule is
  ~c[(:type-set-inverter name)] and by disabling that rune you can
  prevent its being used to decode type-sets.

  Type-sets are inverted when forced assumptions are turned into
  formulas to be proved.  In their internal form, assumptions are
  essentially pairs consisting of a context and a goal term, which was
  forced.  Abstractly a context is just a list of hypotheses which may
  be assumed while proving the goal term.  But actually contexts are
  alists which pair terms with type-sets, encoding the current
  hypotheses.  For example, if the original conjecture contained the
  hypothesis ~c[(integerp x)] then the context used while working on that
  conjecture will include the assignment to ~c[x] of the type-set
  ~c[*ts-integer*].")

; Section:  Handling a List of Classes

; We start by translating the user-supplied list of rule-class tokens.

#|

; Once upon a time we considered the idea of permitting rule classes, e.g.,
; :FORWARD-CHAINING, to be abbreviated by arbitrary subsequences of their
; characters.  We implemented the idea via "disambiguation alists."  We have
; since scrapped the idea for user-level consistency: rule classes are only one
; source of long keywords.  Do we permit the abbreviation of, say, :HINTS by
; :H?  Do we permit the abbreviation of :RULE-CLASSES to :RC?  Do we permit the
; abbreviation of the :PROPS keyword command of LP?  There is a good argument
; that we ought to permit a powerful symbol-level abbreviation convention.
; Macros suffer by requiring parentheses.  But since we don't have the time,
; now, to carry out the root-and-branch implementation of keyword
; disambiguation, we have scrapped the idea for now.  We leave the following
; dead code in place.

(defun char-subsequencep (x y)

; Determine whether x is a subsequence of y, e.g., '(#\B #\D) is a
; char-subsequencep of '(#\A #\B #\C #\D) but not of '(#\A #\D #\B).
; X and y must be true lists of characters.

  (cond ((null x) t)
        ((null y) nil)
        ((eql (car x) (car y))
         (char-subsequencep (cdr x) (cdr y)))
        (t (char-subsequencep x (cdr y)))))

(defun disambiguate1 (x alist)

; Alist should pair character lists with arbitrary values.  We select those
; pairs whose key have x as a subsequence.

  (cond ((null alist) nil)
        ((char-subsequencep x (caar alist))
         (cons (car alist) (disambiguate1 x (cdr alist))))
        (t (disambiguate1 x (cdr alist)))))

(defun make-disambiguation-alist (lst)

; This function is used to preprocess a true list of symbols into an
; alist suitable for disambiguate.  For example, '(FOO BAR) is
; transformed into '(((#\F #\O #\O) . FOO) ((#\B #\A #\R) . BAR)).

  (cond ((null lst) nil)
        (t (cons (cons (coerce (symbol-name (car lst)) 'list) (car lst))
                 (make-disambiguation-alist (cdr lst))))))

(defun assoc-cdr (x alist)

; Like assoc-equal but uses the cdr of each pair in alist as the key.

  (cond ((null alist) nil)
        ((equal x (cdar alist)) (car alist))
        (t (assoc-cdr x (cdr alist)))))

(defun disambiguate (token alist ctx phrase state)

; This function disambiguates token wrt alist or else causes an error.
; Token must be a symbol and alist must be a ``disambiguation alist,''
; an alist pairing lists of characters to symbols.  For example, if
; token is :EM and alist includes the pair ((#\E #\L #\I #\M) . :ELIM)
; and no other pair whose key has EM as a subsequence, then no error
; is caused and :ELIM is returned as the value.  If the token is a
; subsequence of no key or of more than one key, an error is caused.
; Phrase is a tilde-@ phrase that fills in the sentence: "The
; acceptable ~@1 are ..." so, for example, phrase might be "rule
; classes".

; We adopt the convention, for sanity, that if token is eq to the
; value component of some pair in alist, then its meaning is itself.
; This guarantees that if you spell a token out completely you get that
; token and no other; in particular, you don't get an ambiguity error
; just one key in the alist is a subsequence of another.

  (cond
   ((assoc-cdr token alist) (value token))
   (t
    (let ((winners (disambiguate1 (coerce (symbol-name token) 'list) alist)))

; The following alist is used to disambiguate rule classes provided in defthm
; events.  However, for sanity I have included in the list the class
; :EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART which is never typed by the user but which is used as
; rule-classes in names.  Those tokens are sometimes abbreviated when the user
; mentions them in theories and hence we must be able to handle them.  When an

; Rockwell Addition:  In the old code, the recursivep property of a
; singly recursive function was the function name itself; the
; recursivep property of a function in a mutually-recursive clique was
; the list of all the fns in the clique.  In order to speed up the
; check to determine if there is a recursive function on the fnstack,
; I decided to make the recursivep property of a recursive fn be
; a list of all the fns in its "clique" -- possibly the singleton
; list containing just the singly recursive function name.  That way,
; if the fnstack contains a function name, I know it is non-recursive.
; In support of this change, I changed the processing of :definition
; rules.  In the old code, the translated clique of a :definition was
; made atomic (i.e., the fn name itself) if the clique was a singleton.
; For sanity, I don't do that now:  the translated clique is what
; you wrote.  This change shows up several times in the window-compare
; because in the old code we had to change back and forth between
; (fn) and fn.

  :pr assoc-append ; if assoc-append is a rewrite rule, prints that rule

  Also ~pl[pr!], which is similar but works at the command level
  instead of at the event level, and ~pl[pl], which displays all
  rewrite rules for calls of ~c[fn], not just those introduced at
  definition time.

  ~c[Pr] takes one argument, a logical name, and prints the rules
  associated with it.  In each case it prints the rune, the current
  enabled/disabled status, and other appropriate fields from the rule.
  It may be helpful to read the documentation for various kinds of
  rules in order to understand the information printed by this
  command.  For example, the information printed for a linear rule
  might be:
  ~bv[]
    Rune:     (:LINEAR ABC)
    Status:   Enabled
    Hyps:     ((CONSP X))
    Concl:    (< (ACL2-COUNT (CAR X)) (ACL2-COUNT X))
    Max-term: (ACL2-COUNT (CAR X))
    Backchain-limit-lst:    (3)
  ~ev[]
  The ~c[hyps] and ~c[concl] fields for this rule are fairly
  self-explanatory, but it is useful to ~pl[linear] to learn about
  maximal terms (which, as one might guess, are stored under
  ``Max-term'').

  Currently, this function does not print congruence rules or
  equivalence rules.

  General Form:
  (find-rules-of-rune rune wrld)
  ~ev[]~/

  This function finds all the rules in ~c[wrld] with ~c[:]~ilc[rune] rune.  It
  returns a list of rules in their internal form (generally as
  described by the corresponding ~c[defrec]).  Decyphering these rules is
  difficult since one cannot always look at a rule object and decide
  what kind of record it is without exploiting many system invariants
  (e.g., that ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] runes only name rewrite-rules).

  At the moment this function returns ~c[nil] if the rune in question is a
  ~c[:]~ilc[refinement] rune, because there is no object representing
  ~c[:]~ilc[refinement] rules.  (~c[:]~ilc[refinement] rules cause changes in the
  ~c['coarsenings] properties.)  In addition, if the rune is an
  ~c[:]~ilc[equivalence] rune, then congruence rules with that rune will be
  returned ~-[] because ~c[:]~ilc[equivalence] lemmas generate some congruence
  rules ~-[] but the fact that a certain function is now known to be an
  equivalence relation is not represented by any rule object and so no
  such rule is returned.  (The fact that the function is an
  equivalence relation is encoded entirely in its presence as a
  ~c['coarsening] of ~ilc[equal].)"

  ":Doc-Section Break-Rewrite

  to enable or disable the breaking of rewrite rules~/

  General Form:

  ~ev[]
  where ~c[flg] evaluates to ~c[t] or ~c[nil].  This function modifies
  ~ilc[state] so that the attempted application of certain rewrite rules are
  ``broken.'' ``~c[Brr]'' stands for ``break-rewrite'' and can be thought of as
  a mode with two settings.  The normal mode is ``disabled.''

  When ~c[brr] mode is ``enabled'' the ACL2 rewriter monitors the attempts to
  apply certain rules and advises the user of those attempts by entering an
  interactive wormhole break.  From within this break the user can watch
  selected application attempts.  ~l[break-rewrite].  The user can also
  interact with the system during ~c[brr] breaks via ~ilc[brr-commands].

  The rules monitored are selected by using the ~ilc[monitor] and
  ~ilc[unmonitor] commands.  It is possible to break a rune ``conditionally''
  in the sense that an interactive break will occur only if a specified
  predicate is true of the environment at the time of the attempted
  application.  ~l[monitor] and ~pl[unmonitor].

  Even if a non-empty set of rules has been selected, no breaks will occur
  unless ~c[brr] mode is enabled.  Thus, the first time in a session that you
  wish to monitor a rewrite rule, use ~c[:brr] ~c[t] to enable ~c[brr] mode.
  Thereafter you may select runes to be monitored with ~ilc[monitor] and
  ~ilc[unmonitor] with the effect that whenever monitored rules are tried (and
  their break conditions are met) an interactive break will occur.  Be advised
  that when ~c[brr] mode is enabled the rewriter is somewhat slower than
  normal.  Furthermore, that sluggishness persists even if no runes are
  monitored.  You may regain normal performance ~-[] regardless of what runes
  are monitored ~-[] by disabling ~c[brr] mode with ~c[:brr] ~c[nil].

  Why isn't ~c[brr] mode disabled automatically when no runes are monitored?
  More generally, why does ACL2 have ~c[brr] mode at all?  Why not just test
  whether there are monitored runes?  If you care about the answers,
  ~pl[why-brr].

  BRR Mode and Console Interrupts: If the system is operating in ~c[brr] mode
  and you break into raw Lisp (as by causing a console interrupt or happening
  upon a signalled Lisp error; ~pl[breaks]), you can return to the ACL2
  top-level, outside any ~c[brr] environment, by executing
  ~c[(]~ilc[abort!]~c[)].  Otherwise, the normal way to quit from such a break
  (for example ~c[:q] in GCL, ~c[:reset] in Allegro CL, and ~c[q] in CMU CL)
  will return to the innermost ACL2 read-eval-print loop, which may or may not
  be the top-level of your ACL2 session!  In particular, if the break happens
  to occur while ACL2 is within the ~c[brr] environment (in which it is
  preparing to read ~ilc[brr-commands]), the abort will merely return to that
  ~c[brr] environment.  Upon exiting that environment, normal theorem proving
  is continued (and the ~c[brr] environment may be entered again in response to
  subsequent monitored rule applications).  Before returning to the ~c[brr]
  environment, ACL2 ``cleans up'' from the interrupted ~c[brr] processing.
  However, it is not possible (given the current implementation) to clean up
  perfectly.  This may have two side-effects.  First, the system may
  occasionally print the self-explanatory ``Cryptic BRR Message 1'' (or 2),
  informing you that the system has attempted to recover from an aborted
  ~c[brr] environment.  Second, it is possible that subsequent ~c[brr] behavior
  in that proof will be erroneous because the cleanup was done incorrectly.
  The moral is that you should not trust what you learn from ~c[brr] if you
  have interrupted and aborted ~c[brr] processing during the proof.  These
  issues do not affect the behavior or soundness of the theorem prover."

  ":Doc-Section Miscellaneous

  an explanation of why ACL2 has an explicit ~ilc[brr] mode~/

  Why isn't ~ilc[brr] mode automatically disabled when there are no
  monitored runes?  The reason is that the list of monitored runes is
  kept in a wormhole state.~/

  ~l[wormhole] for more information on wormholes in general.  But
  the fundamental property of the wormhole function is that it is a
  logical ~c[no-op], a constant function that does not take state as an
  argument.  When entering a wormhole, arbitrary information can be
  passed in (including the external state).  That information is used
  to construct a near copy of the external state and that ``wormhole
  state'' is the one with respect to which interactions occur during
  breaks.  But no information is carried by ACL2 out of a wormhole ~-[]
  if that were allowed wormholes would not be logical no-ops.  The
  only information carried out of a wormhole is in the user's head.

  ~ilc[Break-rewrite] interacts with the user in a wormhole state because
  the signature of the ACL2 rewrite function does not permit it to
  modify ~ilc[state].  Hence, only wormhole interaction is possible.  (This
  has the additional desirable property that the correctness of the
  rewriter does not depend on what the user does during interactive
  breaks within it; indeed, it is logically impossible for the user to
  affect the course of ~ilc[rewrite].)

  Now consider the list of monitored runes.  Is that kept in the
  external state as a normal state global or is it kept in the
  wormhole state?  If it is in the external state then it can be
  inspected within the wormhole but not changed.  This is
  unacceptable; it is common to change the ~il[monitor]ed rules as the
  proof attempt progresses, installing monitors when certain rules are
  about to be used in certain contexts.  Thus, the list of monitored
  runes must be kept as a wormhole variable.  Hence, its value cannot
  be determined outside the wormhole, where the proof attempt is
  ongoing.

  This raises another question: If the list of monitored runes is
  unknown to the rewriter operating on the external state, how does
  the rewriter know when to break?  The answer is simple: it breaks
  every time, for every rune, if ~ilc[brr] mode is enabled.  The wormhole is
  entered (silently), computations are done within the wormhole state
  to determine if the user wants to see the break, and if so,
  interactions begin.  For unmonitored runes and runes with false
  break conditions, the silent wormhole entry is followed by a silent
  wormhole exit and the user perceives no break.

  Thus, the penalty for running with ~ilc[brr] mode enabled when there are
  no monitored runes is high: a wormhole is entered on every
  application of every rune and the user is simply unware of it.  The
  user who has finally unmonitored all runes is therefore strongly
  advised to carry this information out of the wormhole and to do ~c[:]~ilc[brr]
  ~c[nil] in the external state when the next opportunity arises.")

  :unify-subst        the substitution that, when applied to :target,
                      produces the left-hand side of the rule being

                      :EVALing the rule, (brr@ :failure-reason) is nil
                      if (brr@ :wonp) is t.  Rather than document the
                      various non-nil objects returned as the failure

                      describes information about term assumed to hold
                      in the current context.  The type-alist may be
                      used to determine the current assumptions, e.g.,
                      whether A is a CONSP.

  :ancestors       *  a stack of frames indicating the backchain history
                      of the current context.  The theorem prover is in
                      the process of trying to establish each hypothesis
                      in this stack.  Thus, the negation of each hypothesis
                      can be assumed false.  Each frame also records the
                      rules on behalf of which this backchaining is being
                      done and the weight (function symbol count) of the
                      hypothesis.  All three items are involved in the
                      heuristic for preventing infinite backchaining.
                      Exception:  Some frames are ``binding hypotheses''
                      (equal var term) or (equiv var (double-rewrite term))
                      that bind variable var to the result of rewriting

  :gstack          *  the current goal stack.  The gstack is maintained
                      by rewrite and is the data structure printed as the
                      current ``path.''  Thus, any information derivable
                      from the :path brr command is derivable from gstack.
                      For example, from gstack one might determine that
                      the current term is the second hypothesis of a
                      certain rewrite rule.

  In general ~c[brr@-expressions] are used in break conditions, the
  expressions that determine whether interactive breaks occur when
  ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune]s are applied.  ~l[monitor].  For example, you
  might want to break only those attempts in which one particular term
  is being rewritten or only those attempts in which the binding for
  the variable ~c[a] is known to be a ~ilc[consp].  Such conditions can be
  expressed using ACL2 system functions and the information provided
  by ~c[brr@].  Unfortunately, digging some of this information out of the
  internal data structures may be awkward or may, at least, require
  intimate knowledge of the system functions.  But since conditional
  expressions may employ arbitrary functions and macros, we anticipate
  that a set of convenient primitives will gradually evolve within the
  ACL2 community.  It is to encourage this evolution that ~c[brr@] provides

  where ~c[rune] is a ~il[rune] and ~c[term] is a term, called the ``break
  condition.'' ~c[Rune] must be either a ~c[:rewrite] ~il[rune] or a
  ~c[:definition] ~il[rune].

  When a ~il[rune] is ~il[monitor]ed any attempt to apply it may result in an
  interactive break in an ACL2 ``~il[wormhole] ~il[state].'' There you will get
  a chance to see how the application proceeds.
  ~l[break-rewrite] for a description of the interactive loop
  entered.  Whether an interactive break occurs depends on the value
  of the break condition expression associated with the ~il[monitor]ed
  ~il[rune].

  NOTE: Some ~c[:rewrite] rules are considered ``simple abbreviations'';
  ~pl[simple].  These can be be monitored, but only at certain times during the
  proof.  Monitoring is carried out by code inside the rewriter but
  abbreviation rules may be applied by a special purpose simplifier inside the
  so-called ~em[preprocess] phase of a proof.  If you desire to monitor an
  abbreviation rule, a warning will be printing suggesting that you may want to
  supply the hint ~c[:DO-NOT '(PREPROCESS)]; ~pl[hints].  Without such a hint,
  an abbreviation rule can be applied during the preprocess phase of a proof,
  and no such application will cause an interactive break.

  To remove a ~il[rune] from the list of ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune]s, use ~c[unmonitor].
  To see which ~il[rune]s are ~il[monitor]ed and what their break conditions
  are, evaluate ~c[(monitored-runes)].

  ~c[Monitor], ~c[unmonitor] and ~c[monitored-runes] are macros that expand into
  expressions involving ~c[state].  While these macros appear to return
  the list of ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune]s this is an illusion.  They all print
  ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune] information to the comment window and then return
  error triples instructing ~c[ld] to print nothing.  It is impossible to
  return the list of ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune]s because it exists only in the
  ~il[wormhole] ~il[state] with which you interact when a break occurs.  This
  allows you to change the ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune]s and their conditions during
  the course of a proof attempt without changing the ~il[state] in which
  the the proof is being constructed.

  Unconditional break points are obtained by using the break condition
  ~c[t].  We now discuss conditional break points.  The break condition,
  ~c[expr], must be a term that contains no free variables other than
  ~c[state] and that returns a single non-~c[state] result.  In fact, the
  result should be ~c[nil], ~c[t], or a true list of commands to be fed to the
  resulting interactive break.  Whenever the system attempts to use
  the associated rule, ~c[expr] is evaluated in the ~il[wormhole] interaction
  ~il[state].  A break occurs only if the result of evaluating ~c[expr] is
  non-~c[nil].  If the result is a true list, that list is appended to the
  front of ~c[standard-oi] and hence is taken as the initial user commands
  issued to the interactive break.

  In order to develop effective break conditions it must be possible
  to access context sensitive information, i.e., information about the
  context in which the ~il[monitor]ed ~il[rune] is being tried.  The ~c[brr@] macro
  may be used in break conditions to access such information as the
  term being rewritten and the current governing assumptions.  This
  information is not stored in the proof ~il[state] but is transferred into
  the ~il[wormhole] ~il[state] when breaks occur.  The macro form is ~c[(brr@ :sym)]
  where ~c[:sym] is one of several keyword symbols, including ~c[:target] (the
  term being rewritten), ~c[:unify-subst] (the substitution that
  instantiates the left-hand side of the conclusion of the rule so
  that it is the target term), and ~c[:type-alist] (the governing
  assumptions).  ~l[brr@].

  For example,
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) 
                  (equal (brr@ :target) '(app a (app b c)))
  ~ev[]
  will monitor ~c[(:rewrite assoc-of-app)] but will cause an interactive
  break only when the target term, the term being rewritten, is
  ~c[(app a (app b c))].

  Because break conditions are evaluated in the interaction
  environment, the user developing a break condition for a given ~il[rune]
  can test candidate break conditions before installing them.  For
  example, suppose an unconditional break has been installed on a
  ~il[rune], that an interactive break has occurred and that the user has
  determined both that this particular application is uninteresting
  and that many more such applications will likely occur.  An
  appropriate response would be to develop an expression that
  recognizes such applications and returns ~c[nil].  Of course, the hard
  task is figuring out what makes the current application
  uninteresting.  But once a candidate expression is developed, the
  user can evaluate it in the current context simply to confirm that
  it returns ~c[nil].

  Recall that when a break condition returns a non-~c[nil] true list that
  list is appended to the front of ~c[standard-oi].  For example,
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) '(:go)
  ~ev[]
  will cause ~c[(:rewrite assoc-of-app)] to be ~il[monitor]ed and will make
  the break condition be ~c['(:go)].  This break condition always
  evaluates the non-~c[nil] true list ~c[(:go)].  Thus, an interactive break
  will occur every time ~c[(:rewrite assoc-of-app)] is tried.  The break
  is fed the command ~c[:go].  Now the command ~c[:go] causes ~c[break-rewrite] to
  (a) evaluate the attempt to apply the lemma, (b) print the result of
  that attempt, and (c) exit from the interactive break and let the
  proof attempt continue.  Thus, in effect, the above ~c[:monitor] merely
  ``traces'' the attempted applications of the ~il[rune] but never causes
  an interactive break requiring input from the user.

  It is possible to use this feature to cause a conditional break
  where the effective break condition is tested ~st[after] the lemma has
  been tried.  For example:
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:monitor (:rewrite lemma12) 
                  '(:unify-subst
                    :eval$ nil
                    :ok-if (or (not (brr@ :wonp))
                               (not (equal (brr@ :rewritten-rhs) '(foo a))))
                    :rewritten-rhs)
  ~ev[]
  causes the following behavior when ~c[(:rewrite lemma12)] is tried.  A
  break always occurs, but it is fed the commands above.  The first,
  ~c[:unify-subst], causes ~c[break-rewrite] to print out the unifying
  substitution.  Then in response to ~c[:eval$] ~c[nil] the lemma is tried but
  with all ~il[rune]s temporarily ~il[unmonitor]ed.  Thus no breaks will occur
  during the rewriting of the hypotheses of the lemma.  When the
  attempt has been made, control returns to ~c[break-rewrite] (which will
  print the results of the attempt, i.e., whether the lemma was
  applied, if so what the result is, if not why it failed).  The next
  command, the ~c[:ok-if] with its following expression, is a conditional
  exit command.  It means exit ~c[break-rewrite] if either the attempt was
  unsuccessful, ~c[(not (brr@ :wonp))], or if the result of the rewrite is
  any term other than ~c[(foo a)].  If this condition is met, the break is
  exited and the remaining break commands are irrelevant.  If this
  condition is not met then the next command, ~c[:rewritten-rhs], prints
  the result of the application (which in this contrived example is
  known to be ~c[(foo a)]).  Finally, the list of supplied commands is
  exhausted but ~c[break-rewrite] expects more input.  Therefore, it
  begins prompting the user for input.  The end result, then, of the
  above ~c[:monitor] command is that the ~il[rune] in question is elaborately
  traced and interactive breaks occur whenever it rewrites its target
  to ~c[(foo a)].

  We recognize that the above break condition is fairly arcane.  We
  suspect that with experience we will develop some useful idioms.
  For example, it is straightforward now to define macros that monitor
  ~il[rune]s in the ways suggested by the following names:  ~c[trace-rune],
  ~c[break-if-target-is], and ~c[break-if-result-is].  For example, the last
  could be defined as
  ~bv[]
  (defmacro break-if-result-is (rune term)
    `(monitor ',rune
              '(quote (:eval :ok-if
                             (not (equal (brr@ :rewritten-rhs) ',term))))))
  ~ev[]
  (Note however that the submitted term must be in translated form.)

  Since we don't have any experience with this kind of control on
  lemmas we thought it best to provide a general (if arcane) mechanism
  and hope that the ACL2 community will develop the special cases that
  we find most convenient."

  conditional exit from ~c[break-rewrite]~/
  ~bv[]
  Example Form:
  :ok-if (null (brr@ :wonp))~/

  General Form:
  :ok-if expr
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[expr] is a term involving no free variables other than ~c[state]
  and returning one non-~c[state] result which is treated as Boolean.
  This form is intended to be executed from within ~c[break-rewrite]
  (~pl[break-rewrite]).

  Consider first the simple situation that the ~c[(ok-if term)] is a
  command read by ~c[break-rewrite].  Then, if the term is non-~c[nil],
  ~c[break-rewrite] exits and otherwise it does not.

  More generally, ~c[ok-if] returns an ACL2 error triple
  ~c[(mv erp val state)].  (~l[ld] for more on error triples.)  If
  any form being evaluated as a command by ~c[break-rewrite] returns
  the triple returned by ~c[(ok-if term)] then the effect of that form
  is to exit ~il[break-rewrite] if term is non-~c[nil].  Thus, one
  might define a function or macro that returns the value of ~c[ok-if]
  expressions on all outputs and thus create a convenient new way to
  exit ~c[break-rewrite].

  The exit test, ~c[term], generally uses ~c[brr@] to access context sensitive
  information about the attempted rule application.  ~l[brr@].
  ~c[Ok-if] is useful inside of command sequences produced by break
  conditions.  ~l[monitor].  ~c[:ok-if] is most useful after an ~c[:eval]
  command has caused ~c[break-rewrite] to try to apply the rule because in
  the resulting break environment ~c[expr] can access such things as
  whether the rule succeeded, if so, what term it produced, and if
  not, why.  There is no need to use ~c[:ok-if] before ~c[:eval]ing the rule
  since the same effects could be achieved with the break condition on
  the rule itself.  Perhaps we should replace this concept with
  ~c[:eval-and-break-if]?  Time will tell."
