; This file, init.lisp, is the standard KCL init file.  We use this
; tiny init file, which indirects to akcl-init.lisp, so that we can
; avoid loading in the full init file if it has already been loaded.

; This file need not be distributed with ACL2 and is unimportant for
; the correct operation of ACL2.  This file is loaded automatically by
; ACKL when it starts up, but not by ACL2 when running in any other
; Common Lisp.

; File acl2r.lisp is created by the makefile, though the user could create it
; directly (which may be useful in non-Unix environment when make is not
; available).  It isn't necessary to create this file, however, when one is
; building a standard image, since all it does it push :non-standard-analysis
; onto *features*.  (It IS necessary however, when building a standard image,
; NOT to have acl2r.lisp around if it pushes that feature!)

; We may need a bigger stack than the default, as evidenced by the failure of
; the event (verify-guards read-utf8-fast ...) in books/unicode/read-utf8.lisp.
; We handle this issue here for GCL, and elsewhere for some other lisps.
; However, we have seen GCL 2.6.6 on Windows break here, so we skip the stack
; adjustment for Windows.
