(in-package "ACL2")

; A quick sketch of the three main functions here

; We renamed these functions because their nqthm names were confusing to
; one of us.

; ACL2                   Nqthm
; simplify-clause        SIMPLIFY-CLAUSE
; simplify-clause1       SIMPLIFY-CLAUSE0
; rewrite-clause         SIMPLIFY-CLAUSE1

; Simplify-clause is the top-level clause simplifier but it does
; relatively little work.  It merely determines what to expand and
; what not to, taking into account induction as described in comments
; in simplify-clause.  The real workhorse of simplify-clause is its
; subroutine, simplify-clause1.

; Simplify-clause1 is non-recursive.  It does an enormous amount of
; clause level work: removing trivial equations, detecting
; propositional tautologies with type-set, setting up the
; simplify-clause-pot-lst for the later literal-by-literal-rewriting,
; detecting linear arithmetic tautologies, and retrieving useful
; equalities from the linear arithmetic pot-lst.  Once all that has
; happened, it calls rewrite-clause which begins the classic sweep of
; the clause rewriting each literal.

; Rewrite-clause is concerned only with rewriting the literals of a
; clause.  It does not do any clause level work aside from that
; necessary to avoid tail biting.  It rewrites each lit in turn,
; clausifies the result into a bunch of segments and splices them into
; the evolving set of answers.

; In this section we develop rewrite-clause.

; Note: The following two functions are no longer called.  The were
; called before we made type-set track dependencies.  However, after
; that change, we found the burden of passing up the ttrees generated
; below to be so off-putting that we eliminated their calls in favor
; of dumb-negate-lit and a no-op.  It is our belief that these changes
; do not seriously weaken the system.  Comments indicating the changes
; contain calls of the two functions so these decisions can be
; reconsidered.

; Here is why subsumes-rec and subsumes1 take a "count" argument to limit the

; Forward Chaining

; ACL2 implements a rudimentary form of forward chaining -- though it
; is getting less rudimentary as time goes on!  It sits at the
; top-level of clause simplification.  Before we begin to rewrite the
; literals of a clause, in the same place we set up the
; simplify-clause-pot-lst, we forward chain from the negations of the
; literals of the clause and construct a list of all the
; (heuristically approved) conclusions we can derive.  Each concl is
; paired with a tree that contains the 'lemma and 'pt dependencies.
; That list of pairs is passed down to the rewrite-clause level, where
; it is used to augment the type-alist before rewriting any given
; literal.

; This is the third version of forward chaining.  For an extensive
; comment on version II, see the historical plaque after the definition
; of forward-chain.

; A forward chaining rule is

(defrec forward-chaining-rule
  ((rune . nume) trigger hyps concls . match-free) nil)

; One of the main inefficiencies in our earlier forward chaining schemes
; was that if a rule began to fire but misfired because some hyp could
; not be relieved, we would reconsider firing it later and redo the work
; associated with the misfire.  We avoid that by storing what we call a
; "forward chaining activation" record which permits us to suspend the
; attempt to fire a rule and resume it later.

(defrec fc-activation
  (inst-hyp (hyps . ttree)
            unify-subst inst-trigger . rule) t)

; Warning: If you reorder the fields recode suspend-fc-activation, which
; exploits the layout to conserve conses when modifying instances.

; An fc-activation represents an attempt to apply the given
; forward-chaining-rule.  Suppose a term of interest unifies with the
; trigger term of some rule.  Then we try to relieve the hypotheses of
; that rule, using the current set of assumptions.  Imagine that we
; relieve all those up to but not including hypn, producing an extended
; unify substitution and a ttree recording the dependencies.  But then we
; learn that hypn is not yet definitely nil or definitely non-nil.  Since
; the list of assumptions is growing, we may be able eventually to
; establish hypn.  Therefore, instead of just quitting and starting over
; we suspend the attempted application of rule by producing an
; fc-activation record that records our current state.

; The current unify-subst, ttree and rule are stored in the slots of
; those names.  The inst-trigger is the term in the current problem
; that fired this rule.  What about inst-hyps and hyps?  What do they
; hold?  There are two cases of interest: either hypn -- the hyp we
; are trying to establish -- contains free variables under unify-subst
; or it does not.  If it does, then in the fc-activation, inst-hyp is
; *t* and hyps is the cdr of the hyps of the rule that starts with
; hypn.  If it does not, then inst-hyp is hypn/unify-subst and hyps is
; the cdr of the rule that starts immediately after hypn.  (Because we
; make an activation simply to begin processing a rule, there is the
; unusual case in which the rule has no hyps.  In that case, inst-hyp
; is *t* and hyps is nil.)

(defun fc-activation (term rule ttree force-flg ens)

; activation for a term in the initial clause, this ttree will be nil.  When we
; are building an activation for a term derived by some fc derivation, the

; in this activation will mean that the conclusion we eventually derive cannot
; be worse than the conclusion of the derivation from which this term sprang.
; Once upon a time this function did not take the ttree arg and just used nil.
; But that gave rise to infinite loops that were not stopped by our worse-than
; hacks because the terms from which the bad terms were derived were not
; logically dependent on their parents.

; We map over hyps and try to relieve each one.  The idea is to return four
; results: new values for inst-hyp, hyps, unify-subst, and ttree.  If we prove
; all the hyps, the new inst-hyp is *t* and the new hyps is nil.  If we show
; some hyp false, the new inst-hyp is *nil*.

; However, each of these results is given as a list since a free variable may
; be bound in several ways, each of which generates a different conclusion.
; The four lists are in lock step with each other (e.g., the first result is
; the first element of each list).  Thus, the lists will always have the same
; length.  Moreover, for efficiency we accumulate into the four result lists
; that are passed in:  acc1, acc2, acc3, acc4.

; We decided not to structure this function like relieve-hyps (giving
; rise to a relieve-fc-hyp) because the answer is so complicated since it
; is involved with state saving.

; We know four ways to relieve a hyp.  If it has no free vars, we try
; type-set and we use evaluation (if it is ground).  If it has free
; vars, we look it up in the type-alist.  In both cases we respect
; FORCEd and CASE-SPLITd hyps.  The way we fail determines what we return.

; Note: Forward chaining was first coded before type-set could force
; 'assumptions.  Thus, splitting on 'assumptions was uncommon, indeed,
; it was only done for the output of linear arithmetic, where we first
; used the idea in the late 70's.  Thus, the forward chaining
; mechanism was designed so as not to produce any 'assumptions, i.e.,
; so as not to call rewrite.  When type-set was extended, assumption
; generation and handling became more wide-spread.  In particular,
; this function can generate assumptions due to the call of type-set
; below and those assumptions are handled by the caller of the
; forward-chaining module.  So now, except for these historical
; comments, there is no rationale behind this function's abstinence
; from rewrite.  Mixing forward and backward chaining so intimately
; might be interesting.  It might also be a can of worms.  It might
; also be inevitable.  It just isn't the most important thing to do
; just yet.

; Forward Chaining Derivations - fc-derivation - fcd

; To implement forward chaining, especially to implement the heuristic
; controls on which derived conclusions to keep, we have to use ttrees in
; a rather subtle way that involves embedding a ttree in a tagged object
; in another ttree.  These tagged objects holding ttrees are called
; "fc-derivations".  We motivate and discuss them here.  However, no
; fc-derivation gets out of the forward chaining module.  That is, once
; forward-chain has done its job, the ttrees seen throughout the rest of
; the system are free of 'fc-derivations.

; When we finally relieve all the hyps we will create the instantiated
; conclusion, concl.  However, we do not just turn it loose in the world.
; We need to track it for two reasons.  The first reason concerns the
; ultimate use of such derived conclusions: when we have finished all our
; forward chaining and go into the rewriting of literals we will need to
; choose from among the available forward chained concls those that don't
; depend upon the literal we are rewriting.  For this it is sufficient to
; have the ttree of the conclusion.  The second reason is closer to home:
; before we even get out of forward chaining we have to decide whether
; this derived concl is worth keeping.  This is a heuristic decision,
; aimed primarily at preventing infinite forward chaining while
; permitting "desirable" forward chaining.  Our heuristic is based on
; consideration of how the concl was derived.  Roughly put, we will keep
; it unless it is worse than some concl in its derivation.  So we need to
; record its derivation.  That derivation must contain the names of the
; rules used and the derived conclusions used.

; The obvious thing to do is to add to the ttree of concl the name of the
; rule used and concl itself.  That ttree will attach itself to every
; deduction using concl and by inspecting it we will see concl itself in
; the tree, and by induction, all the concls upon which it depends.
; Unfortunately, this is tricky because ttrees represent sets of all the
; things with a given tag.  Thus, for example, if we were to tag the rule
; name with 'lemma and add it to the tree, we would not record the fact
; that name had perhaps been used twice; the previous occurrence of
; (lemma . name) in the tree would prevent add-to-tag-tree from changing
; the tree.  Similarly, while each concl used would be in the set of all
; things tagged 'concl, we couldn't tell which had been used where, how
; many times, or by which rules.

; So we do something very odd (because it results in a ttree being a
; component of an object stored in a ttree).  We make what we call an
; "fc-derivation" which is a structure of the form:

; (defrec fc-derivation
;   ((rune . concl) (fn-cnt . p-fn-cnt) (inst-trigger . ttree))
;   t)

; Rune is the name of the rule applied, concl is the instantiated conclusion.
; Fn-cnt is the function symbol count of concl (as computed by fn-count) and
; p-fn-cnt is the pseudo-function count (see term-order).  These are used in
; our heuristic for deciding whether to keep a concl.  Ttree is the ttree that
; derived concl from name.  Inst-trigger is the term in the current problem
; that fired this rule.

; If we decide to keep concl then we make a ttree that contains its
; fc-derivation as its only object, tagged 'fc-derivation.  That ttree is
; attached to the assumption of concl in the new type-alist and will
; attach itself to all uses of concl.  Given an fc-derivation we can
; reconstruct the derivation of its concl as follows: concl was derived
; by applying name to all of the derived concls in all of the
; 'fc-derivations in its ttree.

; When the internal forward chaining process is complete we will have
; collected a list of fc-derivations deduced from the given clause.
; The ttree in each derivation will indicate the parent literals via
; 'pt tags.  We can also recover the names of the forward chaining
; rules used.  However, all of this information is not visible to the
; standard ttree scanners because there are ttrees nested inside of
; tagged 'fc-derivations.  For example, if during rewriting we were to
; assume the concl of some fcd and tag it with the ttree in that fcd,
; then that ttree might find its way into the ttree eventually
; returned by rewrite.  That would in turn be looked at by the printer
; to determine which lemmas got used.  And unless we coded the
; printer's sweep to know about the ttrees inside of 'fc-derivations,
; it would miss the forward chaining rules.  Similarly, the sweep to
; determine if a given 'pt is used would have to go into
; 'fc-derivations.  We have decided it is better if, upon finishing
; our forward chaining, we convert the recursively nested ttrees in
; 'fc-derivations to standard ttrees.  This destroys the information
; about exactly how concl was derived from its supporters but it lifts
; out and makes visible the 'lemmas and 'pt upon which the concl is
; based.

; them.  Thus, when we are done we have a ttree with no 'fc-derivation tags,
; but which has 'lemma tags on the set of names in the 'fc-derivations and
; which has all of the 'pt objects and 'assumptions (for example) that were
; recursively embedded in 'fc-derivations.

; Note: This function must be able to find 'fc-derivations anywhere within the
; ttree.  In particular, before we removed ttrees from the type-alists in
; 'assumptions, we had to expunge the fc-derivations within the type-alists.
; See the comment in force-assumptions.  Remember that 'fc-derivations are for
; heuristic use only, except that they may contain 'pt and 'assumption objects
; that we must lift out.  So we should be ruthless about finding and expunging
; all 'fc-derivations.

; Once upon a time we detected an 'fc-derivation at the end of prove.  It
; slipped into the final proof tree as follows: Forward chaining made two
; passes.  During the first, hyp1 was concluded.  During the second, hyp2 was
; concluded and forced an assumption.  That assumption contained the type-alist
; produced from the first pass, which had the 'fc-derivation for hyp1.  Now if
; forward-chaining had proved the theorem, we would be in good shape.  But
; suppose it doesn't prove the theorem and we start rewriting.  Suppose the
; rewriter appeals to hyp2.  That causes it to raise the assumption.  We then
; try, at the end of rewrite-clause, to relieve the assumption by rewriting it
; under its type-alist.  Suppose that we use hyp1 during that successful
; relieving of the assumption: its 'fc-derivation then enters our final proof
; tree.  Here is a script that used to provoke this bug.  The fix, below, is to
; expunge fc-derivations from the :type-alists of assumptions.  We keep this
; script simply because it took a while to find the path down which the
; 'fc-derivation migrated out of forward-chaining.

; Historical Comment:

; Note on the Hard Error below:  How might this error arise?  The intuitive
; argument that it doesn't goes like this:  This function is called in
; forward-chain, on something produced by by forward-chain1.  But inspection of
; forward-chain1 shows that it uses type-alist-fcd-lst to check that approved
; fc derivations are not contradictory.  What can go wrong?  Well, one thing
; that has gone wrong is that type-alist-fcd-lst looks at the derivations in a
; different order than they are looked at by this function.  Hence, the old
; familiar type-alist-clause bugaboo (order of the literals) comes into play.
; We have seen an example where forward-chain1 checked ((< 0 x) (< x 1)
; (integerp x)) and found no contradiction but then passed the reversed list to
; this function which found the contradiction and caused the hard error for the
; first time ever.  Our response to that was to put a reconsider-type-alist
; into type-alist-fcd-lst.  But our "proof" that this hard error never arises
; is now suspect.

; When forward-chain has done its job and produced an fc-pair list,
; we will pass that list to rewrite-clause.  Rewrite-clause rewrites
; each literal in turn, under a type-alist constructed from the remaining
; literals (some of which will have been rewritten since forward-chain
; constructed the type-alist returned above) and from the fc-pair list.
; Here is how we construct the type-alist:

(defun select-forward-chained-concls-and-ttrees (fc-pair-lst pt lits ttree-lst)

; Fc-pair-lst is a list of pairs of the form (concl . ttree).  Each ttree
; contains 'pt tags indicating the parents of concl.  Pt is a parent tree.
; Consider those elements of fc-pair-lst, say fc-pair-lst', whose parents are
; disjoint from pt.  While working on the literals in pt we are permitted to
; assume the truth of every concl in fc-pair-lst'.  This function computes
; fc-pair-lst' and destructures it into two lists which we return in the form
; of (mv lits ttree-lst).  Lits and ttree-lst are in 1:1 correspondence.  Each
; lit is the negation of a concl in fc-pair-lst' and the corresponding ttree is
; the ttree for concl in fc-pair-lst'.  Thus, lits can be thought of as a
; clause segment that can be appended to the other literals we get to assume
; false while working on pt.  The ttrees in ttree-lst may have 'assumption tags
; because forwarding chaining may FORCE or CASE-SPLIT.

  (cond ((null fc-pair-lst) (mv lits ttree-lst))
        ((to-be-ignoredp (cdr (car fc-pair-lst)) pt)

            (cons (cdr (car fc-pair-lst))
                  ttree-lst)))))

                                  pot-lst pt)

; We construct a type alist in which we assume (a) the falsity of every literal
; in tail except the first, (b) the falsity of every literal in new-clause, and
; (c) the truth of every concl in fc-pair-lst that is not dependent upon
; any literal noted in the parent tree (:pt) of rcnst.
; We do this by constructing a clause containing the literals in question
; (negating the concls in fc-pair-lst) and calling our general purpose
; type-alist-clause.  As of v2-8, we also pass in the simplify-clause-pot-lst
; to aid in the endeavor since type-set and assume-true-false can now
; (weakly) use linear arithmetic.

; We return a triple, (mv contradictionp type-alist ttree), where
; contradictionp is t or nil and indicates whether we derived a contradiction.
; Type-alist is the constructed type-alist (or nil if we got a contradiction).
; Ttree is a ttree explaining the contradiction (or nil if got no
; contradiction).

; Note: The type-alist returned may contain 'assumption tags.  In addition, the
; type-alist may contain some 'pt tags -- the conclusions derived by forward
; chaining will have their respective ttrees attached to them and these will
; have 'pt tags and could have 'assumptions.  We could throw out the 'pt tags
; if we wanted -- we are allowed to use everything in this type-alist because
; we only put accessible assumptions in it -- but we don't.  We must record the
; ttrees because of the possible 'assumption tags.

; Historical Plaque on Forward Chaining

; General purpose forward chaining was not implemented in Nqthm, although
; the linear arithmetic package and :COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER lemmas were (and
; still are) examples of forward-chaining reasoning.  The first two
; implementations of general purpose forward chaining in ACL2 occurred
; last week (April 9-13, 1990).  They were both implemented one level
; below where the current forward chaining module sits: we did forward
; chaining just before rewriting each literal of the clause, rather
; than doing all the forward chaining once and tracking dependencies.
; They were both abandoned because of inefficiency.  The killer was -- we
; think -- the repeated duplication of forward chaining derivations.  For
; example, if the clause to be rewritten was {~a ~b c1 ... ck} and an
; elaborate forward chaining tree can be built from a and b, then that
; tree was built when we began to rewrite c1 and that tree was built
; again when we began to rewrite c2, etc.  In addition, the old forward
; chaining scheme did not include the idea of triggers, it forward
; chained off the first hypothesis of a :FORWARD-CHAINING rule.  Finally,
; the old scheme used full fledged relieve-hyps to relieve the other hyps
; of the rules -- another potential killer but one that didn't get us
; simply because we had no forward chaining rules with more than one hyp
; in our tests.

; However, in an effort to help software archeologists (not to mention
; the possibility that we might help ourselves avoid repetition of past
; mistakes) we inscribe here an extensive comment written last week:

; The Forward Chaining Essay - Version II (This essay is of at most historic
; interest.  For the current version of forward chaining, search for
; Forward Chaining from the top of this file.)

; We are about to start rewriting the current literal under the
; assumption of the negations of the literals in clause-seg.  We wish to
; forward chain off of these assumptions to generate a type-alist
; suitable for use during the rewriting.

; We return three values: t or nil indicating whether a contradiction was
; found while forward chaining, a new type-alist, and a ttree recording
; the forward-chaining-rules used.

; The form of a :FORWARD-CHAINING rule is:

; (defrec forward-chaining-rule
;   ((rune . nume) key-hyp other-hyps . concls) nil)

; If a lemma such as

; (implies (and hyp1 hyp2 ... hypn) (and concl1 ... conclk))

; is processed as a :FORWARD-CHAINING rule named name we will generate:

; (make forward-chaining-rule
;       :rune rune
;       :nume &
;       :key-hyp hyp1
;       :other-hyps (hyp2 ... hypn)
;       :concls (concl1 ... conclk)
;       :match-free once_or_all)

; which is stored under the 'forward-chaining-rules property of the top
; function symbol of hyp1.  By "top function symbol" we mean the outer
; most function symbol after stripping away any top-level NOT.

; When we apply a forward-chaining-rule we have a context defined by the
; set of assumptions off of which we are forward chaining (which is
; initially obtained by negating the literals of clause-seg) and a
; type-alist encoding those assumptions.  Our main result is, of course,
; the final type-alist.  But the set of assumptions is represented
; explicitly (indeed, somewhat elaborately) to support heuristics
; designed to avoid infinite loops while permitting the desired forward
; chaining.

; The list of assumptions is more properly thought of as the history of
; this forward chaining problem and is held in the variable fc-history.
; More on its structure later.

; Roughly speaking, one applies a :FORWARD-CHAINING rule to a term, hyp1',
; as follows: unify :key-hyp with hyp1' and then relieve-hyps the
; :other-hyps.  If those two steps do not succeed, the application fails.
; If they work, then make a heuristic decision about whether the
; resulting instance of :concls is worthwhile.  If it is not, the
; application fails.  If it is, add concl to the fc-history and
; type-alist and say the application succeeded.

; The structure of fc-history sufficient to support our current
; heuristics has evolved from a naive structure that just listed the
; assumptions made so far.  Initially, our heuristic decision was simply
; whether the candidate concl was worse-than any existing assumption.
; But imagine that among the initial hypotheses are (ASSOC & &) and
; (STATE-P1 S).  And imagine that some forward chaining rule lets you
; pump forward from (STATE-P1 S) to (P (CDR (ASSOC & &))).  Then you
; wouldn't get to use that rule because its conclusion is worse than
; (ASSOC & &).  This was the first indication that worse-than alone was
; too restrictive.  We fixed this by distinguishing the initial
; assumptions from those produced by forward chaining and we did the
; worse-than check only on the newly added ones.

; However, the next problem was illustrated by having two forward
; chaining rules:
;   name1: (state-p1 x) -> (p (nth 2 state))
;   name2: (state-p1 x) -> (p (nth 3 state)),
; that can get in eachother's way.  If the first is used to add its
; conclusion then the second cannot be used because its conclusion is
; worse than that just added.

; So the structure of fc-history is now a list of pairs, each of the form
; (term . hist), where term is one of our assumptions and hist is the
; history of term.  If term is among the initial assumptions, then hist
; is nil.  If term was produced by the rule named name from some term'
; with history hist', then hist is (name term' . hist').

; Thus, another way to view it is that each entry in fc-history is of the
; form (term namek termk ... name2 term2 name1 term1) and means that term
; was produced by a chain of k forward chaining steps: starting with
; term1 (which is in the initial set of assumptions) use name1 to derive
; term2, use name2 to dervie term3, ..., and use namek to derive term.

; Our heuristic for deciding whether to keep a conclusion, concl, is if
; namek has not been used in this chain, keep concl; otherwise, if namek
; has been used, then concl must be worse than nor equal to no termi in
; its chain.

; It is very inefficient to repeatedly hit all the assumptions with all
; the rules until no change occurs.  We have therefore taken steps to
; avoid unnecessary work.  First, if a rule has been successfully applied
; to a term then there is no need to apply it again (only to learn that
; its conclusion is rejected).  Second, if a conclusion has ever been
; produced before, there is no need to add it again (although technically
; it is probably possible to rederive it in a way that permits further
; chaining not permitted by the original derivation).  Third, if a rule
; named name is applied to a term term with derivation d and produces a
; concl that is rejected because of its ancestry, then don't apply name
; to term and d again.  To support this heuristic we have to keep track
; of the failed applications, which we do in the variable bad-appls.

; End of Historical Plaque

; Rockwell Addition: The nu-rewriter is applied to literals.  So
; rewrite-atm is changed below.  In addition, we optionally lambda
; abstract the result.  We also clean up in certain ways.  New code
; extends all the way to the defun of rewrite-atm.

; Essay on Lambda Abstraction

; We will do some lambda abstraction when we rewrite literals.  That
; is implemented here.

; The original idea here was to expand lambdas by ordinary rewriting
; and then to fold them back up, removing duplicate occurrences of
; subterms.  Consider

; ((lambda (x y) (foo x (car y) x))
;  alpha
;  (cons b c))

; This would normally expand to

; (foo alpha b alpha)

; Suppose alpha is very large.  Then this is a problem.  I will
; fold it back up, to get:

; (let* ((u alpha))
;   (foo u b u))

; I have abandoned this idea as far as rewriting goes, though it
; probably still bears a closer look.  But I have adopted it as an
; option for prettyprinting clauses.

; The first sub-problem is identifying the common subterms (e.g.,
; alpha in (foo alpha b alpha)) to abstract away.  I call this the
; multiple subterm problem.

; We say that x is a "multiple subterm" of y if x occurs more than
; once in y.  We say x is a "maximal multiple subterm" of y if x is a
; multiple subterm of y and no other multiple subterm of y contains an
; occurrence of x.

; Our interest in maximal subterms is illustrated by (f (g (m x)) (g
; (m x))).  (M x) is a multiple subterm.  We might abstract this term
; to (let* ((v1 (m x)) (v2 (g v1))) (f v2 v2)).  But if (g (m x)) is
; identified as the first multiple subterm, then we get (let ((v1 (g
; (m x)))) (f v1 v1)) and there is only one let-binding, which we
; prefer.  So we wish to find a maximal multiple subterm.  We will
; eliminate them one at a time.  That way we will find smaller
; terms that still appear more than once.  For example:

; The term (f (g (m x)) (h (m x)) (g (m x))) may give rise first
; to (let* ((v1 (g (m x)))) (f v1 (h (m x)) v1)), but upon abstracting
; that we get (let* ((v2 (m x)) (v1 (g v2))) (f v1 v2 v1)).

; We are only interested in "non-atomic" multiple subterms, i.e.,
; function applications.  Our interest in non-atomic subterms is
; because otherwise we will infinitely recur ``eliminating'' multiple
; occurrences of variable symbols by introducing new variable symbols
; that occur multiple times.

; So to do lambda abstraction on term we will find a non-atomic
; maximal multiple subterm, e1, in term.  If successful, we will
; replace all occurrences of e1 in term by some new variable, say v1,
; producing, say, term1.  Now consider (f e1 term1), where f is some
; irrelevant made-up symbol.  This term has one less non-atomic
; multiple subterm, since e1 occurs only once in it and v1 is atomic.
; Repeat the process on this term until no multiple subterms are
; found.  The result is (f ek ... (f e1 termk)), which we can abstract
; to (let ((vk ek) ... (v1 e1)) termk).

; We would like to carry out this process without manufacturing the
; irrelevant function symbol f.  So we are really interested in
; multiple occurrences of a term in a list of terms.

(mutual-recursion

 (defun maximal-multiple (x term-lst winner)

; In this definition, x is a term, but I am using it as though it were
; just the set of all of its subterms.  I wish to find a non-atomic
; subterm, e, of x that is a maximal multiple subterm in the list of
; terms term-lst.  Winner is either nil or the maximal multiple found

 [Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above. 
 Thanks!]

 ACL2 Warning [Use] in ( THM ...):  It is unusual to :USE an enabled
 :REWRITE or :DEFINITION rule, so you may want to consider disabling
 (:REWRITE HELPER).


 We now augment the goal above by adding the hypothesis indicated by
 the :USE hint.  The hypothesis can be derived from HELPER via instantiation.
 The augmented goal is shown below.

 Goal'
 (IMPLIES (IMPLIES (INTEGERP (+ -1/2 X))
                   (INTEGERP (+ 1 -1/2 X)))
          (IMPLIES (INTEGERP (+ -1/2 X))
                   (INTEGERP (+ 1/2 X)))).

 By case analysis we reduce the conjecture to

 Goal''
 (IMPLIES (AND (OR (NOT (INTEGERP (+ -1/2 X)))
                   (INTEGERP (+ 1 -1/2 X)))
               (INTEGERP (+ -1/2 X)))
          (INTEGERP (+ 1/2 X))).

 This simplifies, using primitive type reasoning, to

 Goal'''
 (IMPLIES (INTEGERP (+ -1/2 X))
          (INTEGERP (+ 1/2 X))).

 Normally we would attempt to prove this formula by induction.  However,
 we prefer in this instance to focus on the original input conjecture
 rather than this simplified special case.  We therefore abandon our
 previous work on this conjecture and reassign the name *1 to the original
 conjecture.  (See :DOC otf-flg.)

 No induction schemes are suggested by *1.  Consequently, the proof
 attempt has failed.

; Cl is a clause.  Tail is a tail of cl and i is the position number
; of its first literal, starting from 0 for the first lit in cl.  See
; find-trivial-equivalence for the rest of the spec.

; It is important to keep in mind that the clause upon which we are working has
; not necessarily been rewritten.  Indeed, it is often the product of previous
; substitutions by the driver of this very function.  (Aside: once upon a time,
; the driver did not evaluate literals as they got stuffed with constants.  At
; the moment it does evaluate enabled fns on constant args.  But that may
; change and so this function is written in a way that assumes the worst: there
; may be reducible terms in the clause.)  Thus, for example, a clause like
;    {(not (equal x 'a)) (not (equal y 'b)) (not (equal x y)) y ...}
; may first produce
;    {(not (equal y 'b)) (not (equal 'a y)) y ...}
; and then
;    {(not (equal 'a 'b)) 'b ...}
; which contains two unexpected sorts of literals: an equivalence with constant
; args and a constant literal.  We must therefore not be surprised by such
; literals.  However, we do not expect them to arise often enough to justify
; making our caller cope with the possibility that we've proved the clause.  So
; if we find such a literal and can decide the clause, we will just immediately
; report that there are no more usable equivalences and let the simplifier
; rediscover the literal.  If we find such a literal and can't decide the
; clause quickly based on equal and iff facts (we are not going to eval
; user-defined equivs) then we will just continue looking for usable
; equivalences.  The idea is that if the discovered lit makes the clause true,
; we don't expect to have screwed it up by continuing to substitute; and if the
; discovered lit just drops out, then our continued substitution is what we
; should have done.  (Aside: If we persist in our decision to reduce literals
; when they are suffed with constants, then these cases will not arise and all
; of the above is irrelevant.)

; Recall our output spec from find-trivial-equivalence.  The six results we
; return are the name of the condition detected (disposable or keeper), the
; location i of the literal, equiv, lhs, rhs and the literal itself.  Otherwise
; we return 6 nils.  (When we succeed, the "lhs" of our result is the term for
; which we are to substitute and "rhs" is the term by which we replace lhs.
; They may in fact come from the opposite sides of the equivalence term.)

; If we find such a literal we return 6 values: the name of the condition
; detected, the location i of the literal, equiv, lhs, rhs and the literal
; itself.  Otherwise we return 6 nils.

; The driver of this function, remove-trivial-equivalences, will substitute rhs
; for lhs throughout cl, possibly delete the literal, and then call us again to
; look for the next trivial equivalence.  This raises a problem.  If the driver
; doesn't delete the literal, then we will return the same one again and loop.
; So the driver supplies us with a list of literals to avoid, avoid-lst, and

;          (p (foo a) 'evg))
; and the old admotion against using (equal (foo b) 'evg).  Here we find [1]
; ``again'' because it is no longer on the list of things to avoid.  Indeed, we
; can even use it to good effect.  Of course, once it is used both it and the
; old avoided literal are to be avoided.

; called "trivial var equivalences" and "trivial quote equivalences."  If we
; find an equation of the first sort we substitute one side for the other and
; delete the equivalence (provided remove-flg is t).  If we find an equation of
; the second sort, we substitute one side for the other but do not delete the
; equivalence.  See find-trivial-equivalence for more details, especially
; concerning avoid-lst.  Hitp is an accumulator that records whether we did
; anything.

; Pt-lst is a list of parent trees in 1:1 correspondence with cl.  Since we
; return a modified version of cl in which some literals may have been deleted,
; we must also return a modified version of pt-lst giving the parent trees for
; the surviving literals.

; The justification for deleting (not (equiv var term)) when var occurs nowhere
; in the clause is (a) it is always sound to throw out a literal, and (b) it is
; heuristically safe here because var is isolated and equiv is reflexive: if
; (implies (equiv var term) p) is a theorem so is p because (equiv term term).

; We return four values:  hitp, cl, pt-lst and ttree.

; No Change Loser.

; Note: We have briefly considered the question of whether we should do
; anything with hypotheses of the form (equiv var term), where var does not
; occur in term, and some (but not all) occurrences of var are equiv-hittable.
; Perhaps we should hit those occurrences but not delete the hypothesis?  We
; think not.  After all, if term is larger than var (as it generally is here),
; why should we replace some occurrences of the small term by the big one?
; They will just be zapped back by rewrite-solidify if the hyp is not deleted.
; However, an exception to this rule is if we see a hypothesis of the form
; (equal lhs 'const) where not every occurrence of lhs is equiv-hittable.
; Such a hyp is not a trivial var equivalence, even if lhs is a variable,
; because of the un-hittable occurrence of var.  But we do count it as a
; trivial quote equivalence and hit var where we can (but don't delete the

; To be predictable, we have to include commutative variants of the

; trying to find (an instance of) the first literal and then trying to
; find the rest, it is faster to put the most unusual literal first in
; each built-in clause.

; all-fnnames-subsumer.  This setting cannot be done automatically because we
; do not know the initial world until we have set up the built-in-clauses.  But
; we do check, with chk-initial-built-in-clauses which is called and reported

; proofs needed to be done that formerly were handled by built-in-clausep.  But
; that problem is reduced or eliminated when we forward-chain and have suitable
; forward-chaining rules from those new predicates.

; built-in-clausep2 can cause this predicate to fail.

; pt of the literal in cl.

; Note: It is a mystery how the opportunity for this merging should arise.  It
; appears to be impossible because seg1 was rewritten under the assumption of
; the falsity of the literals in cl and hence any such literal of seg1 would
; have evaporated.  Nevertheless, in the days before we used pts this function
; had been modified from the rev-append approach to a careful use of
; member-equal and hence duplicate literals do, apparently, arise.

; Note: In normal use, the first literal in cl at the beginning will be the
; marker literal dealt with by crunch-clause-segments2 and
; crunch-clause-segments.  Observe that the pts of literals occurring after
; that marker in cl are completely irrelevant to the behavior of
; crunch-clause-segment, even though we are here careful to move pts from pts1
; into that section of pts when merging occurs.  They are irrelevant because
; crunch-clause-segments2 just collects the pts up to the marker.  It might
; still be important for us to catch merges, since it is possible that two
; literals within seg1 itself will merge and thus we will create a consp pt for

; This function is a special purpose subroutine of rewrite-clause.  Seg1 and

; |  <- seg1 -> | <- seg2 ->                   |

;  unrewritten  |  rewritten

; Context: The rewriter is sweeping through this clause, rewriting each literal
; and assembling a new clause.  It has rewritten none of the seg1 literals and
; all of the seg2 literals.  It has just rewritten some literal called lit3.
; After clausifying the result (and getting in this case lit3a ... lit3z) it is
; about to start rewriting the first literal of seg1, lit4.  It has already
; rewritten lit1'...lit2'.  The rewriter actually keeps the unrewritten part of
; the clause (seg1) separate from the rewritten part (seg2) so that it knows
; when it is done.  In the old days, it would just proceed to rewrite the first
; literal of seg1.

; But we are trying something new.  Suppose lit3 was something like (not
; (member x '(...))).  Then we will get lots of segs, each of the form (equal x
; '...).  We are trying to optimize our handling of this by actually stuffing
; the constant into the clause and running any terms we can.  We do this in
; what we think is a very elegant way: We actually create cl and call
; remove-trivial-equivalences on it.  Then we recover the two parts,
; unrewritten and rewritten.  The trick is how we figure out which is which.
; We put a marker literal into the clause, after seg1 and before
; seg2.  Remove-trivial-equivalences may do a lot of literal evaluation
; and deletion.  But then we find the marker literal and consider everything to
; its left unrewritten and everything else rewritten.

; We return three values: The unrewritten part of cl, the rewritten part of cl,
; and an extension of ttree.

; Essay on Case Limit

; The case-limit component in the case-split-limitations is a number
; used by rewrite-clause to shut down case splitting after a certain
; point is reached.

; The informal heuristic implemented here is ``don't continue to
; rewrite literals once the estimated number of output clauses exceeds
; some limit.''  We call the limit the ``case-limit.''  There are many
; interpretations of this heuristic.  We discuss them here.  In this
; discussion we abstract away from the particulars of given call of
; rewrite-clause and instead consider all the calls of that function
; on the Common Lisp control stack.  Each of those calls can be
; characterized by a picture like this {h1 ... hk ! lit1 ... litn}
; where the hi are already-rewritten terms generated by splitting on
; the literals that we've already rewritten, the ! signifies where we
; are in this case, and the liti are the unrewritten literals from the
; tail of the original clause.  Suppose there are now more than
; case-limit of these cases; we will handle each with the same
; approach.  Here are the approaches that come to mind.  We have
; chosen to implement (1) after some experimentation with (3).

; (0) Stop now and process no further literals.  Return the clause
;     {h1 ... hk lit1 ... litn}.

; The advantage to (0) is that it is the cheapest thing we could do.
; But it dooms us to revisit each of the hi with the rewriter before
; we even look at their combination or their effects on the liti.  The
; other interpretations below all do some work on the liti in hopes
; that we will have less work to do later.

; (1) It is possible that -h1 ... -hk is contradictory, or that -h1
;     ... -hk together with -lit2, ..., -litn, are contradictory.
;     Such contradictions will be found by type-set when we try to
;     assume all of them false in order to rewrite lit1.  So we could
;     proceed to do the type-alist work to set up the ``rewrite'' of
;     each liti, detect the contradiction if it happens, but
;     short-circuit the rewrite at the last minute if no contradiction
;     arises.  In the short-circuit we would just have the rewrite-atm
;     call return liti (i.e., each liti would rewrite to itself).
;     This is actually the simplest change to the code.

; As noted above, if we find a type-set contradiction in (1), we won't
; have to rewrite the hi again for this case.  Otherwise, we will.
; This kind of observation applies to the other ideas below.

; (2) Build the type-alist and actually rewrite each liti while we have
;     all this context in our hands.  If rewriting liti generates an IF-free
;     term (e.g., T or no change or simple normalization), just proceed.
;     But if it generates an IF, pretend we did nothing and rewrite it
;     to itself.

; (3) As (2) above, but if it generates an IF, use the IF without clausifying
;     it.  This has the effect of possibly stripping out of liti all the
;     cases that are precluded by the hi, without generating any more cases.
;     We will eventually see the IFs in this literal again and split them
;     out.

; Once upon a time we implemented a ``creep up to the limit''
; heuristic here: If we have not yet exceeded the case limit but the
; current literal's clausification does exceed the limit, then we left
; that literal in IF form and went on.  We are afraid that when the
; limit is exceeded it is exceeded by some hideous amount, e.g., 2^32
; clauses are produced.  We call such a literal a ``big splitter.''
; The IF form probably tells the user more about what opened than the
; clauses do.  Furthermore, little splitters further on down the
; clause might be allowed to open and may ultimately allow us to
; simplify the big splitter.  This heuristic had to be implemented in
; such a way that the big splitter was eventually split out.  (The
; user might have set the case limit rather low and might be using it
; to introduce cases slowly.)  Our idea was just to allow the split
; when it is the first literal to split.  It eventually will be.  We
; abandoned this creepy idea because it put unsplit big-splitters on
; the type-alist, where they were essentially useless, and then all
; the downstream literals simplified in the empty context, introducing
; many bogus case splits.

; appropriately.

; Historical note: Previous to Version_2.7, rather than add certain
; equalities to cl we performed the substitution suggested by that
; equality.  This substition forced us to carry along another
; argument, which was the list of all such substitutions made to date.
; That was called var-term-substs.  Here is a Historical Comment that
; deals with the necessity for this now eliminated argument.

; Historical Comment
; The argument var-term-substs is a list of pairs of the form (var
; . term).  These represent some of the equations already found, with
; the first pair on the list representing the earliest such equation.
; (That is, the list is in chronology order, not reverse chronological
; order.)  When a new equation is found and that equation relates a
; var to a term (instead of two non-var terms), we do not really add
; the equation to the clause but rather just substitute the term for
; the var, eliminating that variable.  This can raise problems if, for
; example, we find A = B and replace all the B's by A, and then later
; find B = C.  Had we actually added (equal A B) in response to the
; first equation, this would not be a problem.  But since we didn't
; add that equation but just eliminated all the B's in favor of A, we
; now find B = C unconnected to A.  So every time we find a new
; equation from the pot we first apply each of the substitution pairs
; to it, sequentially.

; Here is an example that failed under Version_2.4 (which did not
; have the var-term-substs argument) but succeeded Version_2.5
; (which introduced the argument to fix such problems).

(defun simplify-clause (cl hist pspv wrld state)

; This is the first "clause processor" of the waterfall.  Its input and
; output spec is consistent with that of all such processors.  See the
; waterfall for a general discussion.

; Cl is a clause with history hist.  We can obtain a rewrite-constant
; from the prove spec var pspv.  We assume nothing about the
; rewrite-constant except that it has the user's hint settings in it
; and that the pt is nil.  We install our top-clause and
; current-clause when necessary.

; We return 4 values.  The first is a signal that in general is 'miss,
; 'abort, 'error, or a "hit".  In this case, it is always either 'miss
; or one of 'hit, 'hit-rewrite, or 'hit-rewrite2 (as described further
; below).  When the signal is 'miss, the other 3 values are
; irrelevant.  When the signal is 'hit, the second result is the list
; of new clauses, the third is a ttree that will become that component
; of the history-entry for this simplification, and the fourth is the
; unmodified pspv.  (We return the fourth thing to adhere to the
; convention used by all clause processors in the waterfall (q.v.).)

; If the first result is a "hit" then the conjunction of the new
; clauses returned implies cl.  Equivalently, under the assumption
; that cl is false, cl is equivalent to the conjunction of the new
; clauses.

; On Tail Biting by Simplify-clause:

; Tail biting can occur at the simplify-clause level, i.e., we can
; return a set of clauses that is a generalization of the clause cl,
; e.g., a set whose conjunction is false even though cl is not.  This
; is because of the way we manage the simplify-clause-pot-lst and
; pts.  We build a single pot-lst and use parent trees to
; render inactive those polys that we wish to avoid.  To arrange to
; bite our own tail, put two slightly different versions of the same
; inequality literal into cl.  The poly arising from the second can be
; used to rewrite the first and the poly arising from first can be used
; to rewrite the second.  If the first rewrites to false immediately our
; use of parent trees (as arranged by passing local-rcnst to the recursive
; call of rewrite-clause in rewrite-clause) will wisely prevent the use of
; its poly while rewriting the second.  But if the first rewrites to some
; non-linear term (which will be rewritten to false later) then we'll
; permit ourselves to use the first's poly while working on the second
; and we could bite our tail.

; This would not happen if we produced a new linear pot-lst for each
; literal -- a pot-lst in which the literal to be rewritten was not
; assumed false.  Early experiments with that approach led us to
; conclude it was too expensive.

; If the specification of rewrite is correct, then tail biting cannot
; happen except via the involvement of linear arithmetic.  To see this,
; consider the assumptions governing the rewriting of each literal in the
; clause and ask whether the literal being rewritten in in rewrite-clause
; is assumed false via any of those assumptions.  There are five sources
; of assumptions in the specification of rewrite: (a) the type-alist
; (which is constructed so as to avoid that literal), (b) the assumptions
; in ancestors (which is initially empty), (c) the assumptions in the
; pot-lst (which we are excepting), and (d) 'assumptions in ttree
; (which we are excepting).  Thus, the only place that assumption might
; be found is simplify-clause-pot-lst.  If linear is eliminated, the only
; assumptions left are free of the literal being worked on.

; This is really an interface function between the rewriter and the rest of
; the prover.  It has three jobs.

; The first is to convert from the world of pspv to the world of

; expand-lst, respectively.  This is done as part of the conversion
; from pspv (where induction hyps and concl are found) to rcnst (where
; terms-to-be-ignored-by-rewrite and expand-lst are found).  They are
; so controlled as long as we are in the first simplification stages
; after induction.  As soon as the clause has gone through the
; rewriter with some change, with input free of induction-concl-terms,
; we stop interfering.  The real work horse of clause level
; simplification is simplify-clause1.

; The third job is to convert the simplify-clause1 answers into the

; induction-hyp-terms.)

; Initially we attempted to fix the slowdown mentioned above (the one

; In this case induction-hyp-terms contained the single term
; (binary-op_tree binary-op-name constant-name fix-name (cdr l)).
; Without special treatment of induction-hyp-terms, the above
; binary-op_tree term was rewritten, and hence so was the pseudo-termp
; hypothesis.  The result seemed to give permission to the next
; hypothesis, (pseudo-term-listp l), to be rewritten much more
; agressively than it was formerly, which bogged down the rewriter
; (perhaps even in an infinite loop).

; A later attempt used the simple algorithm that we stop meddling once
; we have made a pass through the rewriter, even if there are still
; induction-concl-terms around.  Lemma flip-eq-subst-commute in
; books/workshops/1999/ivy/ivy-v2/ivy-sources/flip.lisp showed the
; problem with that approach.  Subgoal *1/2' below was produced by
; preprocess-clause.  It produces goal Subgoal *1/2.16, which has a

; after we are done meddling with induction-hyp-terms.  However, that
; caused problems with, for example, the proof of exponents-add-1 in
; books/arithmetic-2/pass1/expt-helper.lisp.  Apparently the forced
; expansion of (EXPT R J) looped with rule exponents-add-2 (rewriting
; r^(i+j)).  At any rate, it seems reasonable enough to keep
; suppression of induction-hyp-terms rewriting in sync with forced
; expansion of induction-concl-terms.

; And we tried one more idea: removing the test on whether the clause had been
; rewritten.  We got one failure, on collect-times-3b in v2-8 in
; books/arithmetic-2/meta/common-meta.lisp.

; What happens in the proof attempt is that the induction-concl-terms have been
; eliminated in Subgoal *1/7''.  If we check for rewriting, no further meddling
; occurs, and the next subgoal (Subgoal *1/7''') is pushed for proof by
; induction.  That's what we want in this case.

; But if we don't check for rewriting then when the induction-concl-term (EXPT
; X J) surprisingly reappears in Subgoal *1/7''', we again expand it.  It
; continues to appear in every other goal, causing a loop.

; Now, the suggestion was not to check whether the goal was rewritten, and
; we've given that one interpretation.  Another interpretation is to record in
; the history the first time we see a disappearance of induction-concl-terms,
; so that we never again try to expand them (or ignore induction-hyp-terms).
; But it seems that the natural way to record such information still involves
; saving extra information (e.g., the signal) in a history entry.  So even
; though it may be redundant, we might as well check that we've done some
; rewriting.  That way we don't have to rely on the immediate appearance of
; induction-concl-terms, and yet we are still guaranteed at least one pass
; through the rewriter before stopping the "meddling".

  Example of simple rewrite rule:

  The theorem prover output sometimes refers to ``simple'' definitions
  and rewrite rules.  These rules can be used by the preprocessor,
  which is one of the theorem prover's ``processes'' understood by the
  ~c[:do-not] hint; ~pl[hints].

  The preprocessor expands certain definitions and uses certain
  rewrite rules that it considers to be ``fast''.  There are two ways
  to qualify as fast.  One is to be an ``abbreviation'', where a
  rewrite rule with no hypotheses or loop stopper is an
  ``abbreviation'' if the right side contains no more variable
  occurrences than the left side, and the right side does not call the
  functions ~ilc[if], ~ilc[not] or ~ilc[implies].  Definitions and rewrite rules can
  both be abbreviations; the criterion for definitions is similar,
  except that the definition must not be recursive.  The other way to
  qualify applies only to a non-recursive definition, and applies when
  its body is a disjunction or conjunction, according to a perhaps
  subtle criterion that is intended to avoid case splits.")

; CLAUSE IDENTIFICATION

; Before we can write the function that prints a description of
; simplify-clause's output, we must be able to identify clauses.  This raises
; some issues that are more understandable later, namely, the notion of the
; pool.  See PUSH-CLAUSE and The Pool.

; Associated with every clause in the waterfall is a unique object
; called the clause identifier or clause-id.  These are printed out
; at the user in a certain form, e.g.,

; [3]Subgoal *2.1/5.7.9.11'''

; but the internal form of these ids is:

(defrec clause-id ((forcing-round . pool-lst) case-lst . primes) t)

; where forcing-round is a natural number, pool-lst and case-lst are true-lists
; of non-zero naturals and primes is a natural.  The pool-lst is indeed a
; pool-lst.  (See the function pool-lst defined below.) The case-lst is
; structurally analogous.

; A useful constant, the first clause-id:

(defconst *initial-clause-id*
  (make clause-id
        :forcing-round 0
        :pool-lst nil
        :case-lst nil
        :primes 0))

; Note: If this changes, inspect every use of it.  As of this writing there is
; one place where we avoid a make clause-id and use *initial-clause-id* instead
; because we know the forcing-round is 0 and pool-lst and case-lst fields are
; both nil and the primes field is 0.

(defun tilde-@-pool-name-phrase (forcing-round pool-lst)

; We use this function to create the printed representation from the
; forcing-round and pool-lst.  This function actually has two uses.  First,
; pool-names are used within a single round to refer to local goals, such as
; when we say "Name the formula above *1." or, more suggestively "Name the
; formula above [2]*1.3.4."  In such use, the forcing round is placed just
; before the star, in square brackets.  But pool-names also play a role in
; "clause ids" such as [2]Subgoal *1.3.4/1.1'''.  Observe that in clause ids
; the pool-name is printed here   ^^^^^^          but the forcing-round is
; not printed in the normal place but before the word "Subgoal."  Basically,
; the forcing-round is always leading.  Thus, we need two versions of this
; function, one that puts the forcing-round in and another that does not.
; Confusingly but conveniently, if the forcing round is 0, we do not display it
; and so the two uses of this function -- to generate stand-alone pool names
; and to generate parts of clause ids -- appear somewhat hidden.  But you will
; find calls of this function where the forcing-round supplied is 0 --
; signallying that we want a pool name to use within a clause id -- even though
; the actual forcing-round at the time of call is non-0.

  Occasionally the ACL2 theorem prover reports that the current goal
  simplifies to itself or to a set including itself.  Such
  simplifications are said to be ``specious'' and are ignored in the
  sense that the theorem prover acts as though no simplification were
  possible and tries the next available proof technique.  Specious
  simplifications are almost always caused by forcing.~/

  The simplification of a formula proceeds primarily by the local
  application of ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite], ~c[:]~ilc[type-prescription], and other rules to its
  various subterms.  If no rewrite rules apply, the formula cannot be
  simplified and is passed to the next ACL2 proof technique, which is
  generally the elimination of destructors.  The experienced ACL2 user
  pays special attention to such ``maximally simplified'' formulas;
  the presence of unexpected terms in them indicates the need for
  additional rules or the presence of some conflict that prevents
  existing rules from working harmoniously together.

  However, consider the following interesting possibility: local
  rewrite rules apply but, when applied, reproduce the goal as one of
  its own subgoals.  How can rewrite rules apply and reproduce the
  goal?  Of course, one way is for one rule application to undo the
  effect of another, as when commutativity is applied twice in
  succession to the same term.  Another kind of example is when two rules
  conflict and undermine each other.  For example, under suitable
  hypotheses, ~c[(length x)] might be rewritten to ~c[(+ 1 (length (cdr x)))]
  by the ~c[:]~ilc[definition] of ~ilc[length] and then a ~c[:]~ilc[rewrite] rule might be used
  to ``fold'' that back to ~c[(length x)].  Generally speaking the
  presence of such ``looping'' rewrite rules causes ACL2's simplifier
  either to stop gracefully because of heuristics such as that
  described in the documentation for ~ilc[loop-stopper] or to cause a
  stack overflow because of indefinite recursion.

  A more insidious kind of loop can be imagined: two rewrites in
  different parts of the formula undo each other's effects ``at a
  distance,'' that is, without ever being applied to one another's
  output.  For example, perhaps the first hypothesis of the formula is
  simplified to the second, but then the second is simplified to the
  first, so that the end result is a formula propositionally
  equivalent to the original one but with the two hypotheses commuted.
  This is thought to be impossible unless forcing or case-splitting
  occurs, but if those features are exploited (~pl[force] and
  ~pl[case-split]) it can be made to happen relatively easily.

  Here is a simple example.  Declare ~c[foo] to be a function of one
  argument returning one result:
  ~bv[]
  (defstub p1 (x) t)
  ~ev[]
  Prove the following silly rule:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm bad
    (implies (case-split (p1 x))
             (p1 x)))
  ~ev[]
  Now suppose we try the following.
  ~bv[]
  (thm (p1 x))
  ~ev[]
  The ~il[rewrite] rule ~c[bad] will rewrite ~c[(p1 x)] to ~c[t], but it will
  be unable to prove the hypothesis ~c[(case-split (p1 x))].  As a result, the
  prover will spawn a new goal, to prove ~c[(p1 x)].  However, since this new
  goal is the same as the original goal, ACL2 will recognize the simplification
  as ~em[specious] and consider the attempted simplification to have failed.

  In other words, despite the rewriting, no progress was made!  In more common
  cases, the original goal may simplify to a set of subgoals, one of which
  includes the original goal.

  If ACL2 were to adopt the new set of subgoals, it would loop
  indefinitely.  Therefore, it checks whether the input goal is a
  member of the output subgoals.  If so, it announces that the
  simplification is ``specious'' and pretends that no simplification
  occurred.

  ``Maximally simplified'' formulas that produce specious
  simplifications are maximally simplified in a very technical sense:
  were ACL2 to apply every applicable rule to them, no progress would
  be made.  Since ACL2 can only apply every applicable rule, it cannot
  make further progress with the formula.  But the informed user can
  perhaps identify some rule that should not be applied and make it
  inapplicable by disabling it, allowing the simplifier to apply all
  the others and thus make progress.

  When specious simplifications are a problem it might be helpful to
  ~il[disable] all forcing (including ~il[case-split]s) and resubmit
  the formula to observe whether forcing is involved in the loop or
  not.  ~l[force].  The commands
  ~bv[]
  ACL2 !>:disable-forcing
  and
  ACL2 !>:enable-forcing
  ~ev[]
  ~il[disable] and ~il[enable] the pragmatic effects of both ~c[force]
  and ~c[case-split].  If the loop is broken when forcing is
  ~il[disable]d, then it is very likely some ~il[force]d hypothesis of
  some rule is ``undoing'' a prior simplification.  The most common
  cause of this is when we ~il[force] a hypothesis that is actually
  false but whose falsity is somehow temporarily hidden (more below).
  To find the offending rule, compare the specious simplification with
  its non-specious counterpart and look for rules that were speciously
  applied that are not applied in the non-specious case.  Most likely
  you will find at least one such rule and it will have a ~ilc[force]d
  hypothesis.  By disabling that rule, at least for the subgoal in
  question, you may allow the simplifier to make progress on the
  subgoal.")
