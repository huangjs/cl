Alpaca is a rich-text editor for authors, written in Common Lisp and
delivered on Mac OS X's Cocoa programming framework. It combines
mac-like editing features such as rich text and font support,
mouse-oriented editing, a complete Aqua interface, printing and PDF
support, and so on, with the programmability of Emacs.

Although Alpaca is deceptively simple in appearance, it is not only
written in Common Lisp; it has a complete Common Lisp compiler and
runtime built into it, and every aspect of the program can be
rewritten in Common Lisp.
