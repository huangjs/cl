;;; Scsynth will stop rendering after the last event in the score.
;;; Because of this there is a :pad that defaults to 5 seconds.  in
;;; the case above the pad needs to be longer because the simple

;;;

; (events (sc-simple-1 10) "sc-simple-1.osc" :pad 20)

;;;
;;; in the above example each simple event was not explicitedly
;;; assigned a node so the default value of -1 was used. This causes
;;; SC to assign a node to the synth. Because many of the commands
;;; that one would want to send an instance of a scsynth require
;;; knowing what node it is, it is usually a good idea to make this
;;; explicit with using the :node init arg.  the following is an
;;; example of using the node-set event to set the parameters of a
;;; synth after it has been initiated. after the synth has played for
;;; two seconds the panning is set to hard left

;;; SC works on the concept of there being a tree of nodes that are
;;; process by the synth engine. Nodes that are at the "head" of the
;;; tree are processed first and those at the "tail" are processed
;;; later.If a node is before another node (or group) it gets process
;;; and the later nodes can take the audio on the same audio bus and
;;; alter it. Typically things tha one want to affect a sound should
;;; come later in the tree. in the following a reverb is initiated on
;;; node 500. the short simple events use the add-action initarg. in
;;; this case 0 indicates that the synth should be pushed to the head
;;; of the tree, and therby is processed first allowing its output to
;;; pass through the reverb. 1 indicated to place the node at the tail
;;; effectively by-passing the reverb. in this example roughly 70% of
;;; the events should get processed through reverb and 30% will not.

;;;
;;; just as individual synths can be placed in a different hierarchy
;;; on the tree, groups can as well. this example does a similiar
;;; thing as above, however in this case groups are being used.
;;; 
;;; first the reverb is initiated and 2 new groups are created with
;;; ids of 10 and 20. The add-action arguments place the first group
;;; (group 10) right before the reverb and group 20 right after the
;;; reverb.
;;; 
;;; now each chord that is sprouted is assigned to a :target of either
;;; group 10 or 20. because of how these groups are situated in the
;;; tree it has the effect of either bypassing or being processed by
;;; the reverb.
