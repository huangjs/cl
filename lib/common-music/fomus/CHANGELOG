v0.2.5
	Mid-measure clef changes in MusicXML

v0.2.4
	Fixed bug with multiple marks on one note in MusicXML backend

v0.2.3
	REGISTER-BACKENDS function (Kilian)--removed +title+ +version+ from callback arguments and exported these (David)
	Fixed more CLISP issues in Windows (viewing/compiling in LilyPond and CMN, finding executables)
	(:SIZE :SMALL) and (:SIZE :TINY) marks (not in backends yet)
	Fixed bug where harmonics weren't being spread over tied notes

	Fixed harmonic/flageolet bug in LilyPond
	Part name fix in LilyPond and CMN backends (Kilian)

v0.2.2
	CLISP port nearly (or maybe all) complete (errors with loop macros--still testing, haven't tested in Winblows yet)
	Can choose which backends to compile with or leave out of installation
	MIDI backend also takes a user callback function as its PLAY argument

v0.2.1
	Fixed error with some clef signatures in LilyPond (ones with underscores)

v0.2.0
	Version bump

v0.1.69
	Fixed placement issues w/ ornaments and accidentals (LilyPond and MusicXML)

v0.1.68
	Fixed Beaming 6 eighths in some measures (5/4 meters)
	TIE mark to force tied notes ((:TIE :BEFORE) and (:TIE :AFTER), default is :AFTER)
	LilyPond slurs over slurred appoggiaturas/acciaccaturas (FOMUS removes the gracenote slur to prevent it from breaking the other slurs if present)
	Initial support for key signatures

v0.1.67
	Tremolo marks can receive optional :NOTATED symbol (meaning the given number is a notated duration like 1/8 or 1/16 and not in beats)
	LILYPOND-VERSION setting (can also pass :VERSION to LilyPond backend)--ex. :lilypond-version "2.8"
	Little bug in MIDI backend when there are no MIDI events to save/playback

v0.1.66
	Fixed cautionary accidentals bug
	Fixed MusicXML nested tuplets (although Finale/Sibelius ignores <tuplets> tags on import)
	More tuplets possible (ie. nontuplets and others that otherwise might be subdivided into nested tuplets are considered)
	Better nested tuplet decisions involving regular groups of nested triplets, nested quintuplets, etc.
	Got rid of CAUT-ACC-AFTER-ONE-MEAS setting
	Level numbers in spanner marks can either be actual levels or IDs (a few more things to be added)

	Fixed: problem with some nested tuplets
	Fixed: tuplets being split unnecessarily into smaller tuplets (happens w/ septuplets + larger tuplets)
	Improved some beaming problems involving tuplets
	Got rid of stupid "simple tuplets" idea (implemented a better algorithm for determining whether to use larger or smaller tuplets)
	Got rid of USE-DEFAULT-MEAS-DIVS and USE-DEFAULT-TUPLET-DIVS settings (there's no real reason to turn these off)
	Added DEFAULT-TUPLETS and TUPLET-MOD settings to let user control how tuplets are notated (the "power of two" one isn't necessarily always used)
	Added LILYPOND-EXE, LILYPOND-OPTS, LILYPOND-OUT-EXT, LILYPOND-VIEW-EXE, LILYPOND-VIEW-OPTS, CMN-VIEW-EXE and CMN-VIEW-OPTS settings (easier to set these in .fomus init file)
	Fixed error with user :8UP and :8DOWN marks
	Fixed error using numbers with :SLUR- marks
	Fixed problems with double slurs (found problem with slurred grace notes underneath other slurs in LilyPond--not fixed yet)
	Fixed error when user specifies no subdivisions in a measure (ex. '(2) in the DIV timesig slot when the meter is 2/4)
	Inprovements in clef changes/distributing across staves (more testing/tweaking needed)
	Much needed test suite underway

	Speed improvements (maybe 50%)
	Improvements in voice distributing
	Slight improvements in note spelling

v0.1.60
	Fixed bug involving invisible rests in complex 3/4 part polyphony
