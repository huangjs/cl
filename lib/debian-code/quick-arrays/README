              Welcome to Version 1.0 of Ron's Quick Arrays!

The Quick Arrays package is a quick and dirty replacement for the standard
array data structure in Common Lisp.  Like a lot of things in Common Lisp,
arrays have lots of fancy, often-unussed features that reduce performance
considerably in many implementations, including Allegro CL and MCL.

Quick Arrays represents arrays as vectors of vectors.  This permits
much faster array references (2-4 times) than the standard method used
in many Common Lisp implementations at the expense of some flexibility.
Quick Arrays are not adjustable and many of the functions that work with
standard arrays have not been implemented for Quick Arrays.

The Quick Arrays package comes in two parts, quick-arrays.cl and qtest.cl.
The first contains the functions and macros that implement quick arrays.
The second file, qtest.cl, contains a simple test program to tell if Quick 
Arrays is faster in your environment than standard arrays.

Read the header of each file for more information.

Thanks for trying Ron's Quick Arrays!
