This directory contains a machine translation of the Fortran package
QUADPACK to Lisp.  The translation was done via f2cl, and was obtained
from the version in clocc (see http://clocc.sourceforge.net).

As mentioned there, this package was obtained from NETLIB
(www.netlib.org).  This is the SLATEC version available on NETLIB,
which is somewhat different from the book.  (I don't know what the
differences are.)
