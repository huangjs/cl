   Major items:

 * Expand and revise Maxima reference manual (all languages),
   including documentation for add-on packages and additional
   figures in the HTML version of the manual

 * Maxima Windows installer bundles wxMaxima user interface

 * Fast integer factorization (function ifactors and friends)


   Backwards-incompatible changes:

 * Rename many functions in the distrib add-on package for greater
   clarity

 * Rename some functions in the descriptive add-on package for greater
   clarity

 * Change name of Xmaxima initialization script to .xmaximarc
   (was xmaxima.ini)

 * Cut out functions j0, j1, jn, i0, i1, and in (superseded some time
   ago by bessel_j and bessel_i functions)

 * Cut out functions tmlin, tmlinsolve, tmnewdet, and tminverse
   (obsolete, superseded by other linear algebra functions)

 * Cut out add-on packages differ and gendif (obsolete, buggy)

 * load(specfun) yields message saying "specfun package superseded by
   orthopoly" (specfun removed in Maxima 5.9.3)

 * interpolate function yields a message saying "interpolate was renamed
   to find_root" (interpolate was renamed in Maxima 5.9.3)

 * Rename functions g0, g1, and gn to scaled_bessel_i0,
   scaled_bessel_i1, and scaled_bessel_i, respectively.
