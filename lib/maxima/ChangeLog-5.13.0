 * unique: function to return unique elements of a list

 * New function float_approx_equal w/ associated global
   variable float_approx_equal_tolerance (for test suite cases)

 * Interface to Lisp string streams: make_string_input_stream,
   make_string_output_stream, get_output_stream_string


   New items in share:

 * vector3d package (thanks to Walter Eastes)

 * Script share/share_testsuite.mac to run tests in share

 * share/contrib/topoly.lisp: new functions elim and elim_allbut


   New items in tests:

 * Commit test scripts written by Michael Wester


   Other revisions:

 * run_testsuite: only simplify expected results, do not evaluate, and
   do not call ratsimp; now tests are more stringent than before

 * equal: recognize Maxima and Lisp arrays and Maxima and Lisp strings

 * find_root: evaluate arguments in an ordinary way

 * apply, outermap: evaluate arguments in an ordinary way

 * save, loadfile, tex, stringout, compfile: evaluate filename argument

 * display code: output space characters (no tabs)

 * share/linearalgebra: improved jacobian and hessian functions

 * share/contrib/lsquares.mac: replaced with a new version

 * share/draw: include geographical data from World Boundaries Database;
   other modifications

 * with_stdout: accepts an output stream as well as a filename

 * share/contrib/topoly.lisp: many improvements in to_poly

 * share/contrib/numericalio: accept stream as well as a filename

 * many other minor improvements
