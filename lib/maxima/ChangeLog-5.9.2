 Significant changes from Maxima 5.9.1 to 5.9.2,
 in no particular order.
 Magnitude of changes varies widely.


 * Parser is now entirely case sensitive, built-in keywords and variables are all lowercase only

 * Regularize case in printed messages

 * Improved TeXmacs interface, 2-d input

 * Moved nset (finite set functions) into Maxima core

 * Ported Mersenne twister rng to Maxima core

 * English reference manual revised (form and content)

 * Reference manual translated to Spanish and Portuguese

 * Additional tutorial documents

 * Discrete plots (for plot2d)

 * Enhancements to tensor packages (Atensor, Ctensor, Itensor)

 * Replaced Airy functions with much more extensive implementation

 * Revisions to Bessel functions

    o Bessel functions with real order and complex argument can be evaluated numerically.

    o bessel_j can be computed for negative real order.

 * Revisions to gamma function

    o Gamma function can be numerically evaluated for complex arguments.

 * Revisions to elliptic functions

    o Bugs 1165488 and 908185 fixed.

    o Fixed issue where many of the routines were returning single-float results instead of double-float when given rational args.

    o elliptic_f with complex args can be numerically evaluated.

    o Other inverse Jacobi routines can be evaluated at complex points.

 * Extensive revisions to hypergeometric functions

    o Adjusted routines to return the new names for the Bessel functions (like bessel_j instead of %j).

    o Similarly, any orthogonal polynomials now use the naming conventions used by the specfun orthogonal polynomial package.

    o Corrected many errors in implementation.

    o Some missing internal functionality added.

    o Bug 1155241 fixed.

    o Bug 1097915 fixed.

    o Branch cuts for various relationships between hypergeometric functions and Legendre functions were implemented or corrected.

 * Revised kill function (fixed several bugs, helps test suite run correctly)

 * Revised code to run test suite

 * Display noun forms 'for and 'if correctly

 * Display if -- then -- elseif correctly

 * Adjust placement of newlines between output lines

 * Establish configuration variable *MAXIMA-TEMPDIR*, make use in plotting

 * Cleaned up autoload declarations

 * Source code lowercase

 * Regularize use of packages in Maxima core

 * Misc code cleanups incl. sloop -> ANSI loop, rename private let and let*

    share/defstruct.lisp:   define structured objects, also multiple assignment

    share/contrib/descriptive/: descriptive statistics

    share/contrib/diffequations/tests/: several new tests

    share/contrib/distrib/: probability distributions

    share/contrib/plotdf.lisp:  direction field plotting

    share/contrib/sarag/:   real algebraic geometry

    share/contrib/state/:   state variable equations

    share/contrib/unit/:    units of measurement

    share/contrib/Zeilberger/:  hypergeometric summation

    share/linearalgebra/:   linear algebra
