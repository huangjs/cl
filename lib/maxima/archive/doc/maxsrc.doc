The MAXSRC directory is a miscellaneous catch-all for source files which aren't
kept in private directories.

OPERS     Run-time interface to the general-rep simplifier.  See
          MAXDOC;OPERS > for more information.

UTILS     Runtime utilities which are independent of the Macsyma data
          representations and conventions.  Generalizations of functions in
          this file are candidates for addition to a general purpose Lisp
          system.

RUNTIM    Function definitions corresponding to macro definitions in various
          Macsyma macro files.  For the benefit of the fix file.

MDOT      Non-commutative product simplification.  SIMPNCT, SIMPNCEXPT.

SUMCON    $SUMCONTRACT, $INTOSUM, $BASHINDICES, $NICEINDICES.

ARDS      Graphics interface for Plasma terminals.
H19	  Graphics interface for Heath 19.
VT100	  Graphics interface for VT-100, VT-132.

TRANSS   User interface & file-hacking part of translator.
TRANSL   Driver. Basic translation properties.
TRANS1   Translation of JPG;MLISP and other FSUBRS.
         which take call-by-name parameters.
TRANS2   LISTS, ARRAYs, other random operators.
TRANS3   LAMBDA. CLOSURES. also used by fsubr call-by-name
         compatibility package.              
TRANS4   operators, ".", "^^" some functions such as GAMMA.
TRANS5   FSUBRS from COMM, and others, these are mere MACRO
         FSUBRS.
TRANSF   floating point intensive properties. BIGFLOAT stuff.
TRUTIL   transl utilities.
TRMODE   definition of MODEDECLARE. run time error checking code.
TRDATA   this is the MODE data for the "built-in" functions.
TRDEBG   User interface to lisp-level debugging aids. 
NTRACE   New macsyma trace package. Also traces lisp functions.
ACALL is some run time support for translated code, array calls.
FCALL  run-time translated function call support for uncompiled
       code. Many FSUBRS which are macros in TRANSQ.
EVALW  EVAL-WHEN definition for interpreter.
[ Macro support. for transl]
LIBMAX;TRANSM   This defines the macro DEF%TR. When compiled on MC
                DEF%TR produces autoload definitions for TRANS1 thru L.
LIBMAX;TPRELU   this file is INCLUDEF'ed by translated macsyma code.
LIBMAX;TRANSQ   these are macros for translated code. Loaded by TPRELU
                this is compile-time only.
LIBMAX;MDEFUN   contains the macro which defines macsyma functions.
                runtime and compile-time.
LIBMAX;PROCS    SUBR-CALL off the property list, first used in TRANSL.
