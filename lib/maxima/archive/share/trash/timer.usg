There is a function in rjf;timer fasl called TIMER which given any 
macsyma expression or command E, will tell how long it takes to evaluate 
E by returning a value of the form xxx msec + yyy gc.  The result of 
evaluating E is available as the value of RESULT.  Example of use: 
TIMER(factor(x^99-y^99)); .  (Rationale is you can now do arithmetic 
on times.  xxx is runtime excluding gc time.)
