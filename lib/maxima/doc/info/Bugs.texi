@deffn {Function} run_testsuite ([@var{options}])
Run the Maxima test suite. Tests producing the desired answer are
considered ``passes,'' as are tests that do not produce the desired
answer, but are marked as known bugs.

@code{run_testsuite} takes the following optional keyword arguments

@table @var
@item display_all
Display all tests.  Normally, the tests are not displayed, unless the test fails.
(Defaults to @code{false}).
@item display_known_bugs
Displays tests that are marked as known bugs.  (Default is @code{false}).
@item tests
This is a list of tests that should be run.  Each test can be
specified by either a string or a symbol.  By default, all tests are
run.  The complete set of tests is specified by @code{testsuite_files}.
@end table

For example @code{run_testsuite(display_known_bugs = true, tests=[rtest5])}
runs just test @code{rtest5} and displays the test that are marked as
known bugs.

@code{run_testsuite(display_all = true, tests=["rtest1", rtest1a])} will
run tests @code{rtest1} and @code{rtest2}, and displays each test.

@code{run_testsuite} changes the Maxima environment.
Typically a test script executes @code{kill} to establish a known environment
(namely one without user-defined functions and variables)
and then defines functions and variables appropriate to the test.

@code{run_testsuite} returns @code{done}.

@defvr {Option variable} testsuite_files

@code{testsuite_files} is the set of tests to be run by
@code{run_testsuite}.  It is a list of names of the files containing
the tests to run.  If some of the tests in a file are known to fail,
then instead of listing the name of the file, a list containing the
file name and the test numbers that fail is used.

For example, this is a part of the default set of tests:

@example
 ["rtest13s", ["rtest14", 57, 63]]
@end example

This specifies the testsuite consists of the files "rtest13s" and
"rtest14", but "rtest14" contains two tests that are known to fail: 57
and 63.

@deffn {Function} bug_report ()
Prints out Maxima and Lisp version numbers, and gives a link
to the Maxima project bug report web page.
The version information is the same as reported by @code{build_info}.

When a bug is reported, it is helpful to copy the Maxima
and Lisp version information into the bug report.

@code{bug_report} returns an empty string @code{""}.
