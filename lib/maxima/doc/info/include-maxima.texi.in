Maxima is a computer algebra system, implemented in Lisp.

Maxima is derived from the Macsyma system,
developed at MIT in the years 1968 through 1982 as part of Project MAC.
MIT turned over a copy of the Macsyma source code to the Department of Energy
in 1982; that version is now known as DOE Macsyma.
A copy of DOE Macsyma was maintained by Professor William F. Schelter
of the University of Texas from 1982 until his death in 2001.
In 1998, Schelter obtained permission from the Department of Energy
to release the DOE Macsyma source code under the GNU Public License,
and in 2000 he initiated the Maxima project at SourceForge to maintain
and develop DOE Macsyma, now called Maxima.
