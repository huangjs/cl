\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

To invoke Maxima in Linux, type
\begin{verbatim}
maxima <enter>
\end{verbatim}


The computer will display a greeting of the sort:
\begin{verbatim}
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
This is a development version of Maxima. The function bug_report()
provides bug reporting information.
(%i1)
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt (\%i1)} is a ``label''.  Each input or output line is labelled and can be referred to by its
own label for the rest of the session.  {\tt i} labels denote your commands and {\tt o} labels
denote displays of the machine's response.  \emph{Never use variable names like {\tt \%i1} or {\tt
\%o5}, as these will be confused with the lines so labeled}.

Maxima distinguishes lower and upper case.
All built-in functions have names which are lowercase only
({\tt sin}, {\tt cos}, {\tt save}, {\tt load}, etc).
Built-in constants have lowercase names ({\tt \%e}, {\tt \%pi}, {\tt inf}, etc).
If you type {\tt SIN(x)} or {\tt Sin(x)},
Maxima assumes you mean something other than the built-in {\tt sin} function.
User-defined functions and variables can have names which are lower or upper case or both.
{\tt foo(XY)}, {\tt Foo(Xy)}, {\tt FOO(xy)} are all different.


\section{Special keys and symbols \label{sec:keys}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To end a Maxima session, type {\tt quit();}.

\item To abort a computation without leaving Maxima, type \verb+^C+.
(Here \verb+^+ stands for the control key, so
that \verb+^C+ means first press the key marked control and hold it down while pressing the C key.)
It is important for you to
know how to do this in case, for example, you begin a computation which is taking too long.
For example:
% sum (1/x^2, x, 1, 10000);
% ^C
\begin{verbatim}
(%i1) sum (1/x^2, x, 1, 10000);

Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 Console interrupt.

Automatically continuing.
To reenable the Lisp debugger set *debugger-hook* to nil.
(%i2)
\end{verbatim}

\item In order to tell Maxima that you have finished your command, use the semicolon ({\tt ;}),
followed by a return.  Note that the return key alone does not signal that you are done with your
input.

\item An alternative input terminator to the semicolon ({\tt ;}) is the dollar sign ({\tt \$}),
which, however, supresses the display of Maxima's computation.  This is useful if you are computing
some long intermediate result, and you don't want to waste time having it displayed on the screen.

%\item If you want to completely delete the current input line (and start this line fresh from the
%beginning), type a double question mark ({\tt ??}).

\item If you wish to repeat a command which you have already given, say on line {\tt (\%i5)}, you may
do so without typing it over again by preceding its label with two single quotes ({\tt ''}), i.e., {\tt
''\%i5}. (Note that simply inputing {\tt \%i5} will not do the job --- try it.)

\item If you want to refer to the immediately preceding result computed my Maxima, you can either
use its {\tt o} label, or you can use the special symbol percent   ({\tt \%}).

\item The standard quantities $e$ (natural log base), $i$ (square root of $-1$) and $\pi$
($3.14159\ldots$) are respectively referred to as \verb+%e+, \verb+%i+,
and \verb+%pi+.  Note that the use of {\tt \%} here as a prefix
is completely unrelated to the use of {\tt \%} to refer to the preceding result computed.

\item In order to assign a value to a variable, Maxima uses the colon ({\tt :}), not the equal
sign.  The equal sign is used for representing equations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Arithmetic \label{sec:arithmetic}}

The common arithmetic operations are
\begin{description}
   \item [{\tt +}] addition
   \item [{\tt -}] subtraction
   \item [{\tt *}] scalar multiplication
   \item [{\tt /}] division
   \item [{\tt \^}]  or {\tt **} exponentiation
   \item [{\tt .}] matrix multiplication
   \item [{\tt sqrt(x)}] square root of {\tt x}.
\end{description}
Maxima's output is characterized by exact (rational) arithmetic.  E.g.,
% 1/100 + 1/101;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i1) 1/100 + 1/101;
                               201
(%o1)                         -----
                              10100
\end{verbatim}
If irrational numbers are involved in a computation, they are kept in symbolic form:
% (1 + sqrt(2))^5;
% expand (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i2) (1 + sqrt(2))^5;
                                      5
(%o2)                    (sqrt(2) + 1)
(%i3) expand (%);
(%o3)                    29 sqrt(2) + 41
\end{verbatim}
However, it is often useful to express a result in decimal notation.  This may be accomplished by
following the expression you want expanded by ``{\tt ,numer}'':
% %, numer;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i4) %, numer;
(%o4)                   82.01219330881976
\end{verbatim}
Note the use here of \verb+%+ 
to refer to the previous result.  In this version of Maxima, {\tt numer} gives 16 significant
figures, of which the last is often unreliable.  However, Maxima can offer \emph{arbitrarily high
precision} by using the {\tt bfloat} function:
% bfloat (%o3);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i5) bfloat (%o3);
(%o5)                  8.201219330881976B1
\end{verbatim}
The number of significant figures displayed is controlled by the Maxima variable {\tt fpprec}, which
has the default value of 16:
% fpprec;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i6) fpprec;
(%o6)                          16
\end{verbatim}
Here we reset {\tt fpprec} to yield 100 digits:
% fpprec: 100;
% ''%i5;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i7) fpprec: 100;
(%o7)                          100
(%i8) ''%i5;
(%o8) 8.20121933088197564152489730020812442785204843859314941221#
2371240173124187540110412666123849550160561B1
\end{verbatim}
Note the use of two single quotes ({\tt ''}) in {\tt (\%i8)} to repeat command {\tt (\%i5)}.  Maxima can
handle very large numbers without approximation:
% 100!;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i9) 100!;
(%o9) 9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146859#
2963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251#
185210916864000000000000000000000000
\end{verbatim}

\section{Algebra \label{sec:algebra}}

Maxima's importance as a computer tool to facilitate analytical calculations becomes more evident
when we see how easily it does algebra for us.  Here's an example in which a polynomial is expanded:
% (x + 3*y + x^2*y)^3;
% expand (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i1) (x + 3*y + x^2*y)^3;
                          2             3
(%o1)                   (x  y + 3 y + x)
(%i2) expand (%);
       6  3      4  3       2  3       3      5  2       3  2
(%o2) x  y  + 9 x  y  + 27 x  y  + 27 y  + 3 x  y  + 18 x  y
                                         2      4        2      3
                                 + 27 x y  + 3 x  y + 9 x  y + x
\end{verbatim}
Now suppose we wanted to substitute {\tt 5/z} for {\tt x} in the above expression:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
% %o2, x=5/z;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i3) %o2, x=5/z;
           2        3                 2               3
      135 y    675 y    225 y   2250 y    125   5625 y    1875 y
(%o3) ------ + ------ + ----- + ------- + --- + ------- + ------
        z         2       2        3       3       4         4
                 z       z        z       z       z         z
                                             2          3
                                       9375 y    15625 y        3
                                     + ------- + -------- + 27 y
                                          5          6
                                         z          z
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
The Maxima function {\tt ratsimp} will place this over a common denominator:
% ratsimp (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i4) ratsimp (%);
           3  6        2  5         3           4
(%o4) (27 y  z  + 135 y  z  + (675 y  + 225 y) z
          2         3          3            2         2
 + (2250 y  + 125) z  + (5625 y  + 1875 y) z  + 9375 y  z
          3   6
 + 15625 y )/z
\end{verbatim}
Expressions may also be {\tt factor}ed:
% factor (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i5) factor (%);
                           2              3
                     (3 y z  + 5 z + 25 y)
(%o5)                ----------------------
                                6
                               z
\end{verbatim}
Maxima can obtain exact solutions to systems of nonlinear algebraic equations.  In this example we
{\tt solve} three equations in the three unknowns {\tt a}, {\tt b}, {\tt c}:
% a + b*c = 1;
% b - a*c = 0;
% a + b = 5;
% solve ([%o6, %o7, %o8], [a, b, c]);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i6) a + b*c = 1;
(%o6)                      b c + a = 1
(%i7) b - a*c = 0;
(%o7)                      b - a c = 0
(%i8) a + b = 5;
(%o8)                       b + a = 5
(%i9) solve ([%o6, %o7, %o8], [a, b, c]);
            25 sqrt(79) %i + 25      5 sqrt(79) %i + 5
(%o9) [[a = -------------------, b = -----------------, 
            6 sqrt(79) %i - 34       sqrt(79) %i + 11
    sqrt(79) %i + 1        25 sqrt(79) %i - 25
c = ---------------], [a = -------------------, 
          10               6 sqrt(79) %i + 34
    5 sqrt(79) %i - 5        sqrt(79) %i - 1
b = -----------------, c = - ---------------]]
    sqrt(79) %i - 11               10
\end{verbatim}
Note that the display consists of a ``list'', i.e., some expression contained between two brackets
{\tt [ \ldots ]}, which itself contains two lists.  Each of the latter contain a distinct solution
to the simultaneous equations.

Trigonometric identities are easy to manipulate in Maxima.  The function {\tt trigexpand} uses the
sum-of-angles formulas to make the argument inside each trig function as simple as possible:
% sin(u + v) * cos(u)^3;
% trigexpand (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i10) sin(u + v) * cos(u)^3;
                          3
(%o10)                 cos (u) sin(v + u)
(%i11) trigexpand (%);
                3
(%o11)       cos (u) (cos(u) sin(v) + sin(u) cos(v))
\end{verbatim}
The function {\tt trigreduce}, on the other hand, converts an expression into a form which is a sum
of terms, each of which contains only a single {\tt sin} or {\tt cos}:
% trigreduce (%o10);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i12) trigreduce (%o10);
       sin(v + 4 u) + sin(v - 2 u)   3 sin(v + 2 u) + 3 sin(v)
(%o12) --------------------------- + -------------------------
                    8                            8
\end{verbatim}
The functions {\tt realpart} and {\tt imagpart} will return the real and imaginary parts of a
complex expression:
% w: 3 + k*%i;
% w^2 * %e^w;
% realpart (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i13) w: 3 + k*%i;
(%o13)                      %i k + 3
(%i14) w^2 * %e^w;
                               2   %i k + 3
(%o14)               (%i k + 3)  %e
(%i15) realpart (%);
                3       2               3
(%o15)        %e  (9 - k ) cos(k) - 6 %e  k sin(k)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Calculus \label{sec:calculus}}

Maxima can compute derivatives and integrals, expand in Taylor series, take limits, and obtain exact
solutions to ordinary differential equations.  We begin by defining the symbol {\tt f} to be the
following function of {\tt x}:
% f: x^3 * %e^(k*x) * sin(w*x);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i1) f: x^3 * %e^(k*x) * sin(w*x);
                         3   k x
(%o1)                   x  %e    sin(w x)
\end{verbatim}
We compute the derivative of {\tt f} with respect to {\tt x}:
% diff (f, x);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i2) diff (f, x);
         3   k x               2   k x
(%o2) k x  %e    sin(w x) + 3 x  %e    sin(w x)
                                                 3   k x
                                            + w x  %e    cos(w x)
\end{verbatim}
Now we find the indefinite integral of {\tt f} with respect to {\tt x}:
% integrate (f, x);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i3) integrate (f, x);
            6      3  4      5  2    7   3
(%o3) (((k w  + 3 k  w  + 3 k  w  + k ) x
       6      2  4      4  2      6   2
 + (3 w  + 3 k  w  - 3 k  w  - 3 k ) x
            4       3  2      5         4       2  2      4
 + (- 18 k w  - 12 k  w  + 6 k ) x - 6 w  + 36 k  w  - 6 k )
   k x                 7      2  5      4  3    6     3
 %e    sin(w x) + ((- w  - 3 k  w  - 3 k  w  - k  w) x
         5       3  3      5     2
 + (6 k w  + 12 k  w  + 6 k  w) x
       5       2  3       4              3       3      k x
 + (6 w  - 12 k  w  - 18 k  w) x - 24 k w  + 24 k  w) %e
             8      2  6      4  4      6  2    8
 cos(w x))/(w  + 4 k  w  + 6 k  w  + 4 k  w  + k )
\end{verbatim}
A slight change in syntax gives definite integrals:
% integrate (1/x^2, x, 1, inf);
% integrate (1/x, x, 0, inf);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i4) integrate (1/x^2, x, 1, inf);
(%o4)                           1
(%i5) integrate (1/x, x, 0, inf);

Integral is divergent
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try debugmode(true);
\end{verbatim}
Next we define the simbol {\tt g} in terms of {\tt f} (previously defined in {\tt \%i1}) and the
hyperbolic sine function, and find its Taylor series expansion (up to, say, order 3 terms) about the
point {\tt x = 0}:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
% g: f / sinh(k*x)^4;
% taylor (g, x, 0, 3);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i6) g: f / sinh(k*x)^4;
                         3   k x
                        x  %e    sin(w x)
(%o6)                   -----------------
                               4
                           sinh (k x)
(%i7) taylor (g, x, 0, 3);
                        2    3   2         2    3   3
         w    w x   (w k  + w ) x    (3 w k  + w ) x
(%o7)/T/ -- + --- - -------------- - ---------------- + . . .
          4    3            4                 3
         k    k          6 k               6 k
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
The limit of {\tt g} as {\tt x} goes to 0 is computed as follows:
% limit (g, x, 0);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i8) limit (g, x, 0);
                               w
(%o8)                          --
                                4
                               k
\end{verbatim}
Maxima also permits derivatives to be represented in unevaluated form (note the quote):
% 'diff (y, x);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i9) 'diff (y, x);
                               dy
(%o9)                          --
                               dx
\end{verbatim}
The quote operator in {\tt (\%i9)} means ``do not evaluate''.  Without it, Maxima would have obtained
0:
% diff (y, x);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i10) diff (y, x);
(%o10)                          0
\end{verbatim}
Using the quote operator we can write differential equations:
% 'diff (y, x, 2) + 'diff (y, x) + y;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i11) 'diff (y, x, 2) + 'diff (y, x) + y;
                           2
                          d y   dy
(%o11)                    --- + -- + y
                            2   dx
                          dx
\end{verbatim}
Maxima's {\tt ode2} function can solve first and second order ODE's:
% ode2 (%o11, y, x);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i12) ode2 (%o11, y, x);
             - x/2          sqrt(3) x            sqrt(3) x
(%o12) y = %e      (%k1 sin(---------) + %k2 cos(---------))
                                2                    2

\section{Matrix calculations \label{sec:matrix}}

Maxima can compute the determinant, inverse and eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices which have
symbolic elements (i.e., elements which involve algebraic variables.) We begin by entering a matrix
{\tt m} element by element:
% m: entermatrix (3, 3);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i1) m: entermatrix (3, 3);

Is the matrix  1. Diagonal  2. Symmetric  3. Antisymmetric  4. General
Answer 1, 2, 3 or 4 : 
4;
Row 1 Column 1: 
0;
Row 1 Column 2: 
1;
Row 1 Column 3: 
a;
Row 2 Column 1:

Row 2 Column 2:

Row 2 Column 3:

Row 3 Column 1:

Row 3 Column 2:

Row 3 Column 3: 
0;

Matrix entered.
                           [ 0  1  a ]
                           [         ]
(%o1)                      [ 1  0  1 ]
                           [         ]
                           [ 1  1  0 ]
\end{verbatim}
Next we find its transpose, determinant and inverse:
% transpose (m);
% determinant (m);
% invert (m), detout;
\begin{verbatim}
(%i2) transpose (m);
                           [ 0  1  1 ]
                           [         ]
(%o2)                      [ 1  0  1 ]
                           [         ]
                           [ a  1  0 ]
(%i3) determinant (m);
(%o3)                         a + 1
(%i4) invert (m), detout;
                        [ - 1   a    1  ]
                        [               ]
                        [  1   - a   a  ]
                        [               ]
                        [  1    1   - 1 ]
(%o4)                   -----------------
                              a + 1
\end{verbatim}
In {\tt (\%i4)}, the modifier {\tt detout} keeps the determinant outside the inverse.  As a check, we
multiply {\tt m} by its inverse (note the use of the period to represent matrix multiplication):
% m . %o4;
% expand (%);
% factor (%);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i5) m . %o4;
                               [ - 1   a    1  ]
                               [               ]
                               [  1   - a   a  ]
                 [ 0  1  a ]   [               ]
                 [         ]   [  1    1   - 1 ]
(%o5)            [ 1  0  1 ] . -----------------
                 [         ]         a + 1
                 [ 1  1  0 ]
(%i6) expand (%);
         [   a       1                                 ]
         [ ----- + -----        0              0       ]
         [ a + 1   a + 1                               ]
         [                                             ]
         [                  a       1                  ]
(%o6)    [       0        ----- + -----        0       ]
         [                a + 1   a + 1                ]
         [                                             ]
         [                                 a       1   ]
         [       0              0        ----- + ----- ]
         [                               a + 1   a + 1 ]
(%i7) factor (%);
                           [ 1  0  0 ]
                           [         ]
(%o7)                      [ 0  1  0 ]
                           [         ]
                           [ 0  0  1 ]
\end{verbatim}
In order to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of {\tt m}, we use the function {\tt
eigenvectors}:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
% eigenvectors (m);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i8) eigenvectors (m);
           sqrt(4 a + 5) - 1  sqrt(4 a + 5) + 1
(%o8) [[[- -----------------, -----------------, - 1], 
                   2                  2
                  sqrt(4 a + 5) - 1    sqrt(4 a + 5) - 1
[1, 1, 1]], [1, - -----------------, - -----------------], 
                       2 a + 2              2 a + 2
    sqrt(4 a + 5) + 1  sqrt(4 a + 5) + 1
[1, -----------------, -----------------], [1, - 1, 0]]
         2 a + 2            2 a + 2
\end{verbatim}
In {\tt \%o8}, the first triple gives the eigenvalues of {\tt m} and the next gives their respective
multiplicities (here each is unrepeated).  The next three triples give the corresponding
eigenvectors of {\tt m}.  In order to extract from this expression one of these eigenvectors, we may
use the {\tt part} function:
% part (%, 2);
\begin{verbatim}
(%i9) part (%, 2);
                sqrt(4 a + 5) - 1    sqrt(4 a + 5) - 1
(%o9)     [1, - -----------------, - -----------------]
                     2 a + 2              2 a + 2
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}

\section{Programming in Maxima \label{sec:programming}}

So far, we have used Maxima in the interactive mode, rather like a calculator.  However, for
computations which involve a repetitive sequence of commands, it is better to execute a program.
Here we present a short sample program to calculate the critical points of a function {\tt f} of two
variables {\tt x} and {\tt y}.  The program cues the user to enter the function {\tt f}, then it
computes the partial derivatives $\mathtt{f_x}$ and $\mathtt{f_y}$, and then it uses the Maxima
command {\tt solve} to obtain solutions to $\mathtt{f_x = f_y = 0}$.  The program is written outside
of Maxima with a text editor, and then loaded into Maxima with the {\tt batch} command.  Here is the
program listing:
\begin{verbatim}
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   this is file critpts.max: 
   as you can see, comments in maxima are like comments in C 

   Nelson Luis Dias, nldias@simepar.br
   created 20000707
   updated 20000707
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
critpts():=(
   print("program to find critical points"),
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   asks for a function
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   f:read("enter f(x,y)"),
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   echoes it, to make sure
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   print("f = ",f),
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   produces a list with the two partial derivatives of f
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   eqs:[diff(f,x),diff(f,y)],
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   produces a list of unknowns
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   unk:[x,y],
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   solves the system
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   solve(eqs,unk)   
)$
\end{verbatim}
The program (which is actually a function with no argument) is called {\tt critpts}. Each line is a
valid Maxima command which could be executed from the keyboard, and which is separated by the next
command by a comma.  The partial derivatives are stored in a variable named {\tt eqs}, and the
unknowns are stored in {\tt unk}.  Here is a sample run:
% batch ("critpts.max");
% critpts ();
\begin{verbatim} 
(%i1) batch ("critpts.max");

batching #p/home/robert/tmp/maxima-clean/maxima/critpts.max
(%i2) critpts() := (print("program to find critical points"), 
f : read("enter f(x,y)"), print("f = ", f), 
eqs : [diff(f, x), diff(f, y)], unk : [x, y], solve(eqs, unk))
(%i3) critpts ();

%e^(x^3 + y^2)*(x + y);
                2    3
               y  + x
f =  (y + x) %e        
(%o3) [[x = 0.4588955685487 %i + 0.35897908710869, 
y = 0.49420173682751 %i - 0.12257873677837],

\end{verbatim}

\section{A partial list of Maxima functions}

See the Maxima reference manual {\tt doc/html/maxima\_toc.html} (under the main Maxima installation directory).
From Maxima itself, you can use {\tt describe(\textit{function name})}.

\begin{description}
   \item[{\tt allroots(a)}] Finds all the (generally complex) roots of the polynomial equation {\tt
   A}, and lists them in {\tt numer}ical format (i.e. to 16 significant figures).
   \item[{\tt append(a,b)}] Appends the list {\tt b} to the list {\tt a}, resulting in a single
   list.
   \item[{\tt batch(a)}] Loads and runs a program with filename {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt coeff(a,b,c)}] Gives the coefficient of {\tt b} raised to the power {\tt c} in
   expression {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt concat(a,b)}] Creates the symbol {\tt ab}.
   \item[{\tt cons(a,b)}] Adds {\tt a} to the list {\tt b} as its first element.
   \item[{\tt demoivre(a)}] Transforms all complex exponentials in {\tt a} to their trigonometric
   equivalents. 
   \item[{\tt denom(a)}] Gives the denominator of {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt depends(a,b)}] Declares {\tt a} to be a function of {\tt b}.  This is useful for
   writing unevaluated derivatives, as in specifying differential equations.
   \item[{\tt desolve(a,b)}] Attempts to solve a linear system {\tt a} of ODE's for unknowns {\tt b}
   using Laplace transforms.
   \item[{\tt determinant(a)}] Returns the determinant of the square matrix {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt diff(a,b1,c1,b2,c2,\ldots,bn,cn)}] Gives the mixed partial derivative of {\tt a} with
   respect to each {\tt bi}, {\tt ci} times.  For brevity, {\tt diff(a,b,1)} may be represented by
   {\tt diff(a,b)}.  {\tt 'diff(\ldots)} represents the unevaluated derivative, useful in specifying
   a differential equation.
   \item[{\tt eigenvalues(a)}] Returns two lists, the first being the eigenvalues of the square
   matrix {\tt a}, and the second being their respective multiplicities.
   \item[{\tt eigenvectors(a)}] Does everything that {\tt eigenvalues} does, and adds a list of the
   eigenvectors of {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt entermatrix(a,b)}] Cues the user to enter an $\mathtt{a} \times\, \mathtt{b}$ matrix,
   element by element.
   \item[{\tt ev(a,b1,b2,\ldots,bn)}] Evaluates {\tt a} subject to the conditions {\tt bi}.  In
   particular the {\tt bi} may be equations, lists of equations (such as that returned by {\tt
   solve}), or assignments, in which cases {\tt ev} ``plugs'' the {\tt bi} into {\tt a}.  The {\tt
   Bi} may also be words such as {\tt numer} (in which case the result is returned in numerical
   format), {\tt detout} (in which case any matrix inverses in {\tt a} are performed with the
   determinant factored out), or {\tt diff} (in which case all differentiations in {\tt a} are
   evaluated, i.e., {\tt 'diff} in {\tt a} is replaced by {\tt diff}).  For brevity in a manual
   command (i.e., not inside a user-defined function), the {\tt ev} may be dropped, shortening the
   syntax to {\tt a,b1,b2,\ldots,bn}.
   \item[{\tt expand(a)}] Algebraically expands {\tt a}.  In particular multiplication is
   distributed over addition.
   \item[{\tt exponentialize(a)}] Transforms all trigonometric functions in {\tt a} to their complex
   exponential equivalents.
   \item[{\tt factor(a)}] Factors {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt freeof(a,b)}] Is true if the variable {\tt a} is not part of the expression {\tt b}.
   \item[{\tt grind(a)}] Displays a variable or function {\tt a} in a compact format.  When used
   with {\tt writefile} and an editor outside of Maxima, it offers a scheme for producing {\tt
   batch} files which include Maxima-generated expressions.
   \item[{\tt ident(a)}] Returns an $\mathtt{a} \times\, \mathtt{a}$ identity matrix.
   \item[{\tt imagpart(a)}] Returns the imaginary part of {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt integrate(a,b)}] Attempts to find the indefinite integral of {\tt a} with respect to
   {\tt b}.
   \item[{\tt integrate(a,b,c,d)}] Attempts to find the indefinite integral of {\tt a} with respect to
   {\tt b}. taken from $\mathtt{b=c}$ to $\mathtt{b=d}$.  The limits of integration {\tt c} and {\tt
   D} may be taken is {\tt inf} (positive infinity) of {\tt minf} (negative infinity).
   \item[{\tt invert(a)}] Computes the inverse of the square matrix {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt kill(a)}] Removes the variable {\tt a} with all its assignments and properties from
   the current Maxima environment.
   \item[{\tt limit(a,b,c)}] Gives the limit of expression {\tt a} as variable {\tt b} approaches
   the value {\tt c}.  The latter may be taken as {\tt inf} of {\tt minf} as in {\tt integrate}.
   \item[{\tt lhs(a)}] Gives the left-hand side of the equation {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt loadfile(a)}] Loads a disk file with filename {\tt a} from the current default
   directory.  The disk file must be in the proper format (i.e. created by a {\tt save} command).
   \item[{\tt makelist(a,b,c,d)}] Creates a list of {\tt a}'s (each of which presumably depends on
   {\tt b}), concatenated from $\mathtt{b=c}$ to $\mathtt{b=d}$
   \item[{\tt map(a,b)}] Maps the function {\tt a} onto the subexpressions of {\tt b}.
   \item[{\tt matrix(a1,a2,\ldots,an)}] Creates a matrix consisting of the rows {\tt ai}, where each
   row {\tt ai} is a list of {\tt m} elements, {\tt [b1, b2, \ldots, bm]}.
   \item[{\tt num(a)}] Gives the numerator of {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt ode2(a,b,c)}] Attempts to solve the first- or second-order ordinary differential
   equation {\tt a} for {\tt b} as a function of {\tt c}.
   \item[{\tt part(a,b1,b2,\ldots,bn)}] First takes the {\tt b1}th part of {\tt a}, then the {\tt
   B2}th part of that, and so on.
   \item[{\tt playback(a)}] Displays the last {\tt a} (an integer) labels and their associated
   expressions.  If {\tt a} is omitted, all lines are played back.  See the Manual for other
   options.
   \item[{\tt ratsimp(a)}] Simplifies {\tt a} and returns a quotient of two polynomials.
   \item[{\tt realpart(a)}] Returns the real part of {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt rhs(a)}] Gives the right-hand side of the equation {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt save(a,b1,b2,\ldots, bn)}] Creates a disk file with filename {\tt a} in the current
   default directory, of variables, functions, or arrays {\tt bi}.  The format of the file permits
   it to be reloaded into Maxima using the {\tt loadfile} command.  Everything (including labels)
   may be {\tt save}d by taking {\tt b1} equal to {\tt all}.
   \item[{\tt solve(a,b)}] Attempts to solve the algebraic equation {\tt a} for the unknown {\tt b}.  A
   list of solution equations is returned.  For brevity, if {\tt a} is an equation of the form
   $\mathtt{c = 0}$, it may be abbreviated simply by the expression {\tt c}.
   \item[{\tt string(a)}] Converts {\tt a} to Maxima's linear notation (similar to Fortran's) just as if
   it had been typed in and puts {\tt a} into the
    buffer for possible editing.  The {\tt string}'ed expression should not be used in a computation. 
   \item[{\tt stringout(a,b1,b2,\ldots,bn)}] Creates a disk file with filename {\tt a} in the current
   default directory, of variables (e.g. labels) {\tt bi}.  The file is in a text format and is not
   reloadable into Maxima. However the strungout expressions can be incorporated into a Fortran,
   Basic or C program with a minimum of editing.
   \item[{\tt subst(a,b,c)}] Substitutes {\tt a} for {\tt b} in {\tt c}.
   \item[{\tt taylor(a,b,c,d)}] Expands {\tt a} in a Taylor series in {\tt b} about $\mathtt{b=c}$,
   up to and including the term $\mathtt{(b-c)^d}$.  Maxima also supports Taylor expansions in more
   than one independent variable; see the Manual for details.
   \item[{\tt transpose(a)}] Gives the transpose of the matrix {\tt a}.
   \item[{\tt trigexpand(a)}] Is a trig simplification function which uses the sum-of-angles
   formulas to simplify the arguments of individual {\tt sin}'s or {\tt cos}'s.  For example, 
   {\tt trigexpand(sin(x+y))} gives {\tt cos(x) sin(y) + sin(x) cos(y)}.
   \item[{\tt trigreduce(a)}] Is a trig simplification function which uses trig identities to
   convert products and powers of {\tt sin} and {\tt cos} into a sum of terms, each of which
   contains only a single {\tt sin} or {\tt cos}.  For example, \verb+trigreduce(sin(x)^2)+ gives
   {\tt (1 - cos(2x))/2}.
   \item[{\tt trigsimp(a)}] Is a trig simplification function which replaces {\tt tan}, {\tt sec},
   etc., by their {\tt sin} and {\tt cos} equivalents.  It also uses the identity 
   $\mathtt{sin()^2 +   cos()^2 = 1}$.
