\chapter{Preface}
Xmaxima is a \index{Tcl/Tk} Tcl/Tk program distributed with \index{Maxima}
Maxima. It can be used as a graphical interface for Maxima, and as an
independent external plotting program that can also be called by Maxima,
when the \index{Openmath} \textbf{openmath} \texttt{plot\_format} option is
selected.

Xmaxima used to be two separate programs, \textbf{xmaxima} and
\textbf{omplotdata} \index{omplotdata}. Most of omplotdata's code was
already included into xmaxima, so the two packages were merged after
version 5.9.3 of Maxima.

The development of those two programs was not very active during the last
years, which gave rise to other alternative programs. In fact, openmath
stopped being the default plot program since version 5.9.1, when
\index{Gnuplot} \emph{Gnuplot} was adopted as default. Recent changes to
the plotting functions of Maxima have been implemented just for Gnuplot
leaving Openmath outdated. On the other hand, there are additional Maxima
modules that will only work with Openmath; for instance, \emph{plotdf}
\index{plotdf}.

We are now working actively on the development of Xmaxima to catch up with
the recent changes and to solve the bugs that made developers move into
Gnuplot as an alternative. Openmath has some nice features that are already
incorporated into Maxima: for instance, the interactivity given by slider
buttons, selection of points on a plot, interactive rotation of 3d plots.
From the point of view of the graphical interface, even though there are
now several other platforms with a nicer interface, Xmaxima already has an
Html browser that accepts pieces of Maxima code to be evaluated. It also
has the advantage of being a fairly simple program; it can be run/inspected
interactively from a \emph{Wish} \index{wish} console, and it is
surprisingly fast considering that it was written in a scripting language.

\chapter{Installing Xmaxima}

The source code for Xmaxima consists of a set of several Tcl/Tk files. In a
computer system with Tcl/Tk, the installation is fairly simple. It consists
on setting up values for a few system variables, appending together the
files to make a single file that will be run by the command \emph{wish},
and moving it into some place where it would be accessible. Those steps are
done by running the configure script in maxima's source main directory, and
then running \texttt{make} and ``\texttt{make config}'' in the
\texttt{interfaces/xmaxima/} subdirectory \index{make}.

The files \index{autoconf} \texttt{autoconf-variables.tcl.in} and
\texttt{Makefile.in}, in the subdirectory \texttt{interfaces/xmaxima/},
give a good idea of the environment variables that need to be set and the
order in which the files must be appended.

\section{Installing Xmaxima under Windows}

The binary distributions of maxima include an installer file for Xmaxima
that when run will install an executable file of a type called
\index{Starpack} \textbf{Starpack}, namely, a file that includes the
complete Tcl/Tk \index{Tcl/Tk} script plus a copy of the Tcl/Tk
interpreter. That will make the \texttt{xmaxima.exe} program autonomous in
Windows and it should run in every Windows version \index{Windows}.

However, the \texttt{xmaxima} program will only be useful if you have
already installed Maxima too, which comes in an independent module. The
communication between the two programs is done using TCP/IP \index{TCP/IP}
port number 4008.  That might make your anti-virus block xmaxima as a virus
\index{anti-virus}; the communication may also be blocked if you have a
firewall \index{firewall}. In both cases you will have to configure your
software to prevent xmaxima from being blocked. The anti-virus program
usually gives you a message telling you that the program is going to be
blocked and giving you a chance to prevent it. The firewall configuration
is a bit more complex and depends on the software you use.  If you have
problems you can ask for help in Maxima's users list \index{Maxima!user's
 list}.

\section{Installing Xmaxima under Unix}

Installing a prebuilt Xmaxima package in Unix is a simple matter. The
program just has to be moved into a place where it can be executed.
However, to make it work you need to have Tcl/Tk \index{Tcl/Tk} installed,
as well a a version of Maxima compatible with the version of Xmaxima being
used \index{Unix}.

You may run into problems if the paths defined in xmaxima are not compatible
with your system. Since the xmaxima program is a Tcl/Tk script, it is a
plain text file that can be edited manually. You can check the paths defined
near the top of the file.

\chapter{Command-line options}

The usage of xmaxima is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  xmaxima [options] file
\end{verbatim}

If a file is given, it is expected to have the syntax of the
\texttt{maxout.openmath} files created by Maxima, namely, a set of plot
commands for openmath. A plot window will be opened and the commands will be
parsed to show the resulting plot. That is the way in which xmaxima is
called from maxima, when run from a console, to create a plot using the
Openmath plot format.

If no filenames are given, xmaxima will open the graphical interface for
Maxima, which includes a Web browser.

The \index{Xmaxima!options} options may be any of the following:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-help}] Displays a summary of the usage. It can be shortened
  as \texttt{-h}
\item[\texttt{-use-version vers\_number}] Will open the version of Maxima
  identified with the label vers\_number, for instance 5.9.3. That option is
  useful only when you have several different versions of Maxima
  installed. It can be abbreviated as \texttt{-u vers\_number}.
\item[\texttt{-lisp flavor}] Run the version of Maxima compiled with the
   Lisp implementation identified by \emph{flavor}. For instance, \texttt{-lisp
    clisp}. That option will be useful if you have more than one maxima
  program, compiled with different variants of Lisp. It can be abbreviated
  as \texttt{-l flavor}\index{Lisp}
\item[\texttt{-url web\_page}] The URL of a page that will substitute the
  default starting page in the Web browser. If you have an Internet
  connection, web\_page can be an external URL, such as
  \texttt{http://maxima.sourceforge.net}. It can also be used to read pages
  locally, using the syntax for local URL's: file://some/where.html
  \index{URL}\index{Web browser}

  If no \texttt{-url} option or file names are given, xmaxima will open the
  web browser in a default Html page that is distributed with Xmaxima. That
  page has links to a local copy of Maxima User's Manual
  \index{Maxima!users manual} and to the home page for the Maxima
  project. It also includes an extension to the Html syntax that allows the
  user to execute Maxima commands in a Web page, by clicking twice over it.
  The Maxima code included might also allow the user to edit it before
  evaluation.
