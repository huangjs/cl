This file enables the display package to display MACSYMA expressions by
putting out characters in a random order (similar to the :TTY program).
To get the random display hack, do LOADFILE(DISRAN,FASL,DSK,SHARE).
This should be done as the first command in MACSYMA.  RANDISP is defined
as a NOFIX operator which just toggles the random mode of display on and
off, so to get things started just do RANDISP;  Then to turn this display
off, just do RANDISP; again.
