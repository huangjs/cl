;; style is a list starting with a symbol from the list: points, lines,
;; linespoints or dots,
;; The meaning of the numbers that follow the symbol are:
;;
;;   lines, linewidth, color
;;   points, radius, color, pointtype
;;   linespoints, linewidth, radius, color, pointtype
;;   dots, color
;;
;; linewidth and radius are measured in the same units and can be
;; floating-point numbers.
;;
;; color must be an integer; values of color from 1 to 7 give the seven
;; default colors. Other integers with lead to the default color that
;; has the same "modulus 7" value. The default colors are:
;;
;;      1 Blue
;;      2 Red
;;      3 Magenta
;;      4 Orange
;;      5 SaddleBrown
;;      6 Lime
;;      7 Aqua
;;
;; pointtype must be an integer; there are 13 default point types. Values
;; of pointtype less than 1 or bigger than 13 will produce the same type
;; as the default type with the same "modulus 23" value. The default types
;; are:
;;      1 Filled circle      8 Filled triangle
;;      2 Open circle        9 Open triangle
;;      3 +                 10 Filled inverted triangle
;;      4 x                 11 Open inverted triangle
;;      5 *                 12 Filled losenge
;;      6 Filled square     13 Open losenge
;;      7 Open square
