Numerical routines for use with Maxima.

These are routines converted from the original Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp via f2cl.  The Fortran code is stored in the
fortran directory.  (Some of the code may have been slightly modified
from the original code obtained from www.netlib.org, but the original
versions are stored in CVS.)

Here is a simple script used to convert the Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp.

To build the Lisp files, use numerical/slatec/slatec.system to do
that.  It contains the necessary options and rules to convert the
SLATEC Fortran files to Lisp.

Also, the converted files were done using CMUCL.  If some other Lisp
is used, the formatting of the files may be totally different.
