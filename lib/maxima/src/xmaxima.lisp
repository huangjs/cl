;; style is a list starting with a symbol from the list: points, lines,
;; linespoints or dots,
;; The meaning of the numbers that follow the symbol are:
;;
;;   lines, linewidth, color
;;   points, radius, color
;;   linespoints, linewidth, radius, color
;;   dots, color
;;
;; linewidth and radius are measured in the same units and can be
;; floating-point numbers.
;;
;; color must be an integer; values of color from 1 to 7 give the seven
;; default colors. Other integers with lead to the default color that
;; has the same "modulus 7". The default colors are:
;;
;;      1 Blue
;;      2 Red
;;      3 Magenta
;;      4 Orange
;;      5 SaddleBrown
;;      6 Green
;;      7 SkyBlue
