   Fixes to WALK-LIST/SEQ and WALK-LIST/MESS that were previously
   non-deterministic, due to the use of RANDOM in creating the data
   structures that they work on.

   New tests: SUM-PERMUTATIONS, WALK-LIST/SEQ, WALK-LIST/MESS, COMPILER,
   LOAD-FASL. SUM-PERMUTATIONS is inspired by Scheme benchmarks by
   Will Clinger. The WALK-LIST/ tests are inspired by Richard Fateman.

   A setup file for MCL, contributed by James Anderson.

   New ascii-graphical report generator contributed by Johannes
   Grödem (file graph-report.lisp).

   New PDF report generator using the cl-pdf library (file
   pdf-report.lisp) 
   
   Improvements to the CMUCL performance-counter code: better
   reporting of data. Look for a new version of cpc.lisp that supports
   UltraSPARC-III processors.

   Split the FPRINT test (speed of printer when writing to a file)
   into FPRINT/PRETTY and FPRINT/UGLY. The former does pretty-printing
   using PPRINT (and binds other pretty-printer-related variables to
   T), whereas the latter disables the pretty-printer. Suggested by
   Christopher Rhodes.

   Support for Allegro CL, thanks to Kevin Layer. See the file
   run-acl.sh and sysdep/setup-acl.lisp. 

   Fiddle with CPU Performance Counters library on UltraSPARC processors
   with CMUCL; see play/cmucl-performance-counters.lisp
