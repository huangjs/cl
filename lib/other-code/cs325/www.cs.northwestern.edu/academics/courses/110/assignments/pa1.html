<H1>Programming Assignment #1</H1>

<P>This assignment is designed to get you started in programming in C. There are
3 problems, which should be done in order. Each problem solution should be
put in a separate C file in a separate project.</p>

<p>If you use Bloodshed's Dev-C++, 
use <a href="../html/devcpp.html">these instructions</a> for compiling code.</p>

<p>If you use Microsoft's Visual Studio, 
use <a href="../html/msvs.html">these instructions</a> for compiling code.</p>

<p>In class, my demonstrations will use Dev-C++.</p>

<h2>Problem #1: Fixing broken code</h2>

<p>Create a new project for this assignment, e.g., PA1.
Add a C file named <tt>pa1_1.c</tt> (for assignment 1, problem 1)
to it. Type the following code into <tt>pa1_1.c</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; ;
int main () {
printf("Type any letter except Z or z: ")
scanf(" %c", lttr);
printf("You typed %d/n");
char next_letter; next_letter = ltr + 1;
printf("The next letter is %c."); /* print
the next letter
Return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>This is not working code.</b> It has several kinds of errors. Furthermore, it is not
written in a very readable way. Fix the program so that it compiles and runs with 
no errors. Then make changes to improve
the readability of the program. A sample execution should go like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Type any letter except Z or z: g
You typed g.
The next letter is h.
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Problem #2: Temperature converter</h2>

<p>Create a new project and add a C file named <tt>pa1_2.c</tt> (for assignment 1, problem 2)
to it. Write code in <tt>pa1_2.c</tt> that does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Asks the user to enter the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Reads the value.</li>
<li>Uses the value to compute the equivalent degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Prints the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>The formula for converting degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius is
<tt>C = (F - 32) . 5.0/9.0</tt>. </p>

<p>Things to think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many variables do you need and what should their types be?</li>

<li>What are the correct format specifiers for reading and writing values of those types?</li>

<li>Is the program user friendly? For example, asking the user to just type a temperature, without
specifying the correct scale (F or C) is a sign of bad design.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem #3: Penny converter</h2>

<p>Create a new project and add a C file named <tt>pa1_3.c</tt> (for assignment 1, problem 2)
to it. Write code in <tt>pa1_3.c</tt> that does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Asks the customer how many pennies they have.</li>

<li>Reads the value.</li>

<li>Calculates how this could be done with fewer coins of larger denomination.</li>

<li>Prints the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if the customer says they have 37 pennies, 
then the program should say that this is equivalent to 
one quarter, one dime and two pennies. A sample execution of
your program could look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Welcome to ACE, the Automatic Coin Exchange machine.
Enter number of pennies: 37
Thank you. Your pennies are worth
1 quarter(s)
1 dime(s)
0 nickel(s)
2 pennies
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Hints and tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>This program is slightly longer, so use the incremental
program development techniques we have discussed
in class. First write a program that does nothing, then add the part where it just reads the
number of pennies, etc.</li>

<li>Take advantage of integer division to compute the change. For example, you can find the
number of quarters in 37 by dividing 37/25, which is 1. Then, you need to find the number of
dimes in the remaining 12 pennies, etc. What arithmetic function in C would do that?</li>

<li>You will need several variables to store everything. Give them meaningful names and comment
your code.</li>

<li>If you want to line things up in columns, you can use <tt>\t</tt> in
a <tt>printf</tt> format string to print out a tab character.</li>
</ul>
