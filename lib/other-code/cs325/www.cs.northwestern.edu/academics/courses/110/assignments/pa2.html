<H1>Programming Assignment #2</H1>

<p class="warning">
If you <a href="../html/info.html#pairs">pair-program</a>, put both names in comments
at the start of all your code files. <em>Pair programming
means all work done together!</em>
</p>


<p>This assignment has two problems. One is a console-based C
program, similar to what you did in the first assignment.
The second, and more interesting in my opinion, is your first program
with graphical output. This program will be the seed of a
quarter-long project of your design.</p>

<h2>Problem #1: Birth Day Calculator</h2>

<p>Do Project 60 in Chapter 5 of the textbook. Call the
main C file <tt>main.c</tt> and put it in a folder called <tt>PA2</tt>.</p>

<h2>Problem #2: Your Interactive Graphics Project, part 1</h2>

<p>Write a program that draws a simple but non-trivial
picture. Call the
main C file <tt>main.c</tt> and put it in a folder
called <tt>GAME</tt>.</p>

<p>What's in the picture is up to you, but it should
be something more interesting and complex than just a couple
of rectangles or circles. A stack of 3 circles may be a snowman,
but it's no challenge.
</p>

<p>As the quarter progresses, you're going to make this picture
more complex and interactive, like a simple
game or a greeting card. So think about what you'd like build
along those lines and draw a picture that fits your
intended theme.</p>

<p>To compile and run programs with
graphics, you need to include not only the code you write, but
extra <em>library</em> code. Library code is code other expert
programmers have written to do most of the grungy work for you.
Your code plus theirs have to be combined together to make a
complete working program.</p>

<p>If you use Microsoft's Visual Studio, 
use <a href="../html/msvs-glut.html">these instructions</a> for creating
graphics programs.</p>

<p>If you use Bloodshed's Dev-C++, 
use <a href="../html/devcpp-glut.html">these instructions</a> for creating
graphics programs.</p>

<p>If you are using XCode on a Macintosh, 
click on this link to download
<a href="../code/apple-graphlib.zip">apple-graphlib.zip</a> from the website. 
It contains the graphics library and
instructions on how to set up the library for use with XCode.</p>

<h2>How to Tackle The Graphics Problem</h2>

<p>Here's my #1 most important rule for programming: <b>take tiny steps.</b></p>

<p>And #2: think before you code.</p>

<p>Try to start with a working program -- even a trivial program 
that does nothing. Then add one simple thing, compile and run, debug
if necessary. Then add one more simple thing. Compile and run and debug.
Never put in more than one new thing without making sure everything still works.
If you have to reorganize things, re-organize a little, but don't add anything
new. Compile and run. If you do this faithfully, you'll save hours in debugging
time.</p>

<p>In the case of your first graphical project, here's my recommended plan of
attack.</p>

<h3>Think: Plan the drawing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Before you write any code, get a sheet of graph paper, the kind with large
squares, and map out your figure or figures on it. 
If you don't have any, Google "printable graph paper" for lots
of sites that provide graph paper you can print.
Remember that you
just have a small number of shapes to work with: rectangles, circles, triangles,
and lines.</li>

<li>Draw a rectangle that just surrounds the entire figure.
Assign a reasonable size in screen pixels for the width of the rectangle.
Set the lower left corner of the rectangle to (0, 0) and calculate
where the other corners are for the entire rectangle, and the shapes
within it.
</li>

<li>Use these numbers to derive general formulas for
the coordinates of every shape. Every shape's coordinates should be
of the form <tt>(x + a * width, y + b * width)</tt>,
where x and y are the coordinates of the lower left corner (x, y)
of the big rectangle, and width is the width of the big rectangle.
</li>
</ul>

<p>By doing this in advance, you'll have a method for drawing your
shape that can go anywhere on the screen at any size you want. All
you'll need to change are three numbers: x, y and width.</p>

<h3>Code: Tiny steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Compile and run <tt>main.c</tt> as it stands. If you don't see the
green square, or if clicking on the <b>Quit</b> button doesn't work, stop and 
post your problem to the newsgroup.</li>

<li>Replace the code inside the function <tt>myDisplay()</tt> with
code to set x, y, and width, and draw one shape in your figure, with
the desired pen color. Compile and run. You should see your shape.
Hit any key to quit.</li>

<li>Now add code to draw the second subshape of your object. Compile and run.
Are the two shapes correctly placed and sized? If not, fix.</li>

<li>Repeat until your shape is complete.</li>

<li><b>Create a function.</b>
Create a new function to draw your figure, with an appropriate name, 
e.g., <tt>drawDog</tt> or <tt>drawFlyingSaucer</tt>. Move the drawing
code in <tt>myDisplay()</tt> into that function. Define the prototype
at the start of the file. For this step, make a function 
that takes no arguments. Change <tt>myDisplay()</tt> to call
this function. Compile and run.</li>

<li><b>Make the function take parameters.</b>
Change your drawing function to take parameters of type <tt>double</tt> for
x, y, and width. Delete the lines declaring those local variables
in your function. Change <tt>myDisplay()</tt> to call
your function with the appropriate values for x, y, and width.
Compile and run.</p>

<li>Add another call to your drawing function in <tt>myDisplay()</tt>.
This second call should draw your object in another location. Compile
and run. Make sure the object appears twice, in the right places, with
all the parts properly aligned.</li>

</ul>
