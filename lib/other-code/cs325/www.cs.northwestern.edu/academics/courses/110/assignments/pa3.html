<H1>Programming Assignment #3</H1>

<p class="warning">
If you <a href="../html/info.html#pairs">pair-program</a>, put both names in comments
at the start of all your code files. <em>Pair programming
means all work done together!</em>
</p>


<p>This assignment has two problems, a console-based C
program, and adding new features to your graphical application.</p>

<h2>Problem #1: Amortization Table</h2>

<p>Do Project 56 in Chapter 6 of the textbook. Call the
main C file <tt>main.c</tt> and put it in the folder <tt>PA3</tt>.</p>

<h2>Problem #2: Your Interactive Graphics Project, part deux</h2>

<p>Add more shapes to your picture in <tt>GAME/main.c</tt> -- a lot more. Use loops
and random numbers to draw a random number of at least one shape
in random places (within reason).  For example, draw birds in the sky
or stars, or cows in a field, or cars on a highway. Whatever makes
sense for your picture.</p>

<p>Make sure that your program draws a different picture each
time you run it.
</p>

<p class="note"><tt>myDisplay()</tt> is called repeatedly and 
frequently, but you want to call your random picture drawing
code once. One way to make this happen is to use a <tt>static
variable</tt> to keep track of whether <tt>myDisplay()</tt>
is being called for the first time or not. Static variables are 
not that commonly needed in basic programs. The book talks about them in 
Appendix J. Just follow the example given in 
<a href="../code/rand_rect.c">rand_rect.c</a>
and you should be OK. As soon as you learn how to use arrays, 
you won't need a static variable.</p>
