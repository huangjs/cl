<H1>Programming Assignment #5</H1>

<p class="warning">
If you <a href="../html/info.html#pairs">pair-program</a>, put both names in comments
at the start of all your code files. <em>Pair programming
means all work done together!</em>
</p>

<p>This assignment has two problems, a console-based C
program, and adding new features to your graphical application.</p>

<p>In both cases, your code will be graded on both <em>correctness</em> (doing
what's it's supposed to) and <em>quality</em> (doing it cleanly). Quality
code is described in the Software Engineering sections at the
end of each chapter. Read those sections before handing in your code!</p>

<p>Submit a Zip file 
<a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/110/html/hw.html">named as usual</a>,
with the following folder structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>A folder <tt>PA5</tt> for <b>Problem #1</b>, containing:
  <ul>
  <li>Your code in <tt>main.c</tt> and any other code files you may have
  created</li>
  <li>The output of your program on the test data files in the file
  <tt>output.txt</tt></li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>A folder <tt>GAME</tt> with your game program <tt>main.c</tt> and 
any other code files you may have created</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem #1: Grade Reports with Names</h2>

<p>Do Project 38 in Chapter 12 of the textbook. Define 
<code>main.c</code> in the folder <tt>PA5</tt>
to print reports to the terminal for two data files:
<a href="named-grades-1.txt">named-grades-1.txt</a> and 
<a href="named-grades-2.txt">named-grades-2.txt</a>.</p>

<p>This is basically the same project as in the previous assignment
but now:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are names in the data file along with the ID and scores.</li>
<li>You need to use strings, structures, and arrays of structures.</li>
<li>You need to seriously clean up your code and make it as modular as possible,
with as few global variables as possible.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Problem #2: Your Interactive Graphics Project, part the fourth</h2>

<p>You have two goals for this final version. Add interactivity to your picture,
and make your code modular. 

<h3>Interaction</h3>

<p>An interactive picture means one where the user
can type keys <em>and</em> click on objects or locations on the screen to make 
things happen. For example, in my Fish picture, I might let users type
left and right cursor to speed up and slow down the fish, and click on a fish
to make it change direction.</p>

<p>Or I could make a "feed the fish" game. As fish swim, they keep getting
smaller and smaller until they disappear. If I click somewhere, food appears
and starts falling to the seabed. If a fish crosses the food before it reaches
the seabed, the fish "eats" the food and gets a little larger. The goal is
to not lose any fish.</p>

<p>Make your interactive picture fun! It could be a game, or an interactive
postcard with surprises. Definite points will be earned for creativity and
usability.</p>

<h3>Modularity</h3>

<p>Modularity in code means that code is not one huge <tt>main()</tt>
function with a dozen global variables. It means code that is</p>

<ul>
<li>broken down into small single-task subfunctions</li>

<li>data kept in local variables, and passed to functions as needed</li>

<li>data stored in structures, e.g., a "fish structure" for data
about a single fish</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, instead of global arrays of x-coordinates, y-coordinates,
sizes, directions, and colors, my Fish game should have just one global
array of fish structures.</p>
