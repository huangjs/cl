<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This tutorial was written for Visual Studio 6.0. Some of the images included here look 
slightly different in .NET. I'm planning to update it, but until then, refer to 
<a href="http://csciwww.etsu.edu/blair/Using_Debugger.htm">this site</a> 
for additional detail. But do read this page first, as it includes some
background material.
</p>

<p>There are several types of errors that can occur at different stages 
of the programming process: <a href="#compiler">compiler errors</a>, 
<a href="#linker">linker errors</a> and <a href="#runtime">run-time 
errors</a>. In this tutorial we will discuss each type and explain 
how you can use the tools provided by Visual Studio to find and correct them.
</p>

<a name="compiler"></a>
<h2>Compiler Errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are the errors that are reported by the compiler.  Usually they are 
simple syntax errors such as misspelled words or missing punctuation. 
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let's try to compile the following program and see what happens:
</p>

<pre class="code">
int main () {
   printf("Hello World!\n)
   return 0;
</pre>

<p>The compiler gives us the following warnings and errors:
</p>

<pre class="code">
D:\test.c(2) : warning C4013: 'printf' undefined; assuming extern returning int
D:\test.c(2) : error C2001: newline in constant
D:\test.c(3) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ')' before 'return'
D:\test.c(4) : fatal error C1004: unexpected end of file found
</pre>

<p>First, we have a warning on line 2. It means that the compiler could not 
find a definition for function <tt>printf</tt>. However, it is possible that 
the definition of this function is in another file of the same project. Since
it is
the job of the linker to "link" together the different files of a project, the
compiler assumes that the problem will be solved at the linking stage. This is 
why it gives us only a warning. In this case, however, we <b>have</b> made
a mistake. The function <code>printf</code> is defined in the standard library
<code>stdio.h</code> which should have been included in the program. 
</p>

<p>
We also have an error on line 2:</p>

<pre class="code">
   printf("Hello World!\n)
</pre>

<p>
The error message suggests that a newline occurred when it wasn't expected. We 
notice that the message that is to be printed is not enclosed in double quotes.
This caused the compiler to think that <code>Hello World!\n)</code> is all part 
of the message but then, when the line ended and the message did not, the 
compiler got confused. To fix this we need to insert the closing double-quote
at the end of the message.
</p>

<p>Now we have an error on line 3. It was expecting a closing parenthesis 
before <code>return</code> but it wasn't there. This is a propagated error. The 
closing parenthesis <b>is</b> there but, because we forgot to close the quotes, the
compiler thought that it was part of the message to be printed. So we can ignore
this error.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we get to the last message. This is easy to figure out. The program
seems to have ended when it shouldn't have: we missed the closing brace for the
<code>main</code> function. 
</p>
<p>Let's see what the corrected program looks like:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;>

int main () {
   printf("Hello World!\n")
   return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Compile it:
</p>

<pre class="code">
D:\test.c(5) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'return'
</pre>

<p>Oops! We have another error: we forgot to terminate the <code>printf</code>
statement with a semicolon. The final, correct program is now:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main () {
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}
</pre>

<hr>

<a name="linker"></a>
<h2>Linker Errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These errors are caused when you forget to define or implement a function.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
Let's compile and link the following program:
</p>

<pre class="code">
int main () {
   myfunction();
   return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The compiler will give us a warning about <code>myfunction</code> but will compile
the program successfully. When we link, however, we get:
</p>

<pre class="code">
test.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _myfunction
Debug/test.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals
</pre>

<p>This is the linker's way of saying "I could not find a definition of function
<code>myfunction</code> anywhere!".
</p>

<p>
What does <em>anywhere</em> mean? The linker first looks at the other files
of the project (if there are any). If it does not find the definition there,
it looks at the files in the <code>Include</code> directory. This is a directory
that contains the files where the standard C library functions are defined.
Note that the linker only looks there because we have set up Visual Studio
this way. Otherwise it would only look at the other files of the project. 
</p>

<p>
Would we get a linker error if we had not included <code>stdio.h</code> in the 
program of the first example? The answer is no, because <code>stdio.h</code> is in 
the <code>Include</code> directory and the linker would find <code>printf</code>
when it looked there.
</p>

<a name="runtime"></a>

<h2>Run-time Errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are logical errors, that is, errors in the design of your program.
They occur when you run your program and they are the most difficult to find. 
The only indication that there is an error is a wrong output or a fault that
causes your program to crash. A program may run fine for years and then suddenly
crash on some input because of a logical error. That's why you
should always test your programs extensively.
</p>

<p>
The process of locating the source of logical errors and correcting them is
called <b>debugging</b>. The term was coined by Admiral Grace Hopper in the 
1940s. According to her journal, when they opened up a computer to try and 
find out why a program was not working, they 
discovered a moth that had gotten inside and caused the
problem. Since then, initially hardware and then logical errors have been 
called "bugs".
To see a picture of this first bug, which had the honor of being pasted onto 
the journal,  
click <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=30">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>debugger</b> is a tool that helps you find logical errors. It enables
you to execute your program one line at a time or in sections, to 
stop execution at a specific point and to check the values of 
variables as you go along. This way, you can better understand how your 
program behaves (as opposed to how you think it behaves) and find the
exact location where the problem is. What the debugger cannot tell you is 
why the problem occurs. This is something you have to figure out yourself.
</p>

<p>
A simple but often useful method of debugging is by
inserting <code>printf</code> statements in various places in the program. This 
enables us to:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Find out whether a specific part of the program is ever reached during 
     execution.
<li> Print out the values of different variables at specific points in the 
     program.
</ul>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Now, we will learn how to use the Visual C++ debugger to find the bugs in the
following program:
</p>

<pre class="code">
/* *******************************************
 * This program reads five integers from the *
 * keyboard and then computes and prints     *
 * their average on the screen.              * 
 ******************************************* */

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define SIZE 5

int main () {
  float sum, ave;
  int i;
  int num[SIZE]; // array to hold the numbers
  for (i=1; i<=SIZE; i++) {
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &amp;num[i]);
  }
  for (i=1; i<=SIZE; i++) 
    sum=sum+num[i];
  ave=sum/SIZE;
  printf("The average is: %f\n", ave);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>This program compiles and links successfully. Let's see what happens when 
we execute it:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
The average is: -21474833.600000
Press any key to continue
</pre>

<p>There is obviously something wrong. Let's use the debugger to find out what:
</p>

<h3> Setting up</h3>

<p>The following figure shows the Build and Debug toolbars.
To make them appear on your Visual C++ desktop, right-click on the blank space
next to the existing toolbars and select <b>Build Minibar</b> and then 
<b>Debug</b>. 
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="../images/toolbar.gif" alt="VS toolbars">
</p>


<h3> Setting breakpoints</h3>

<p>A breakpoint is a point in the program where you want the execution to stop 
temporarily so that you can examine the values of variables. It allows you
to run through portions of the program that are correct and concentrate on
those that aren't (or haven't been checked yet).
</p>

<p>
The symbol for the breakpoint is : <img src="../images/breakpoint.gif" alt="VS breakpoint symbol">
</p>

<p>
Let's say we decide to set a breakpoint right before the 
second <code>for</code>-loop. Move the cursor to the beginning of the 
line <code>for (i=1; i<=SIZE; i++)</code>
and click on the breakpoint symbol. A red dot will appear on the margin left
of the cursor:</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="../images/breakpoint1.gif" alt="VS breakpoint mark">
</p>

<p>
Now, to run the program until the breakpoint, click the Go button: 
<img src="../images/go.gif" alt="VS go button">
You will need to enter the five integers for the program to get there. Notice
the yellow arrow that shows you where in the program you currently are.
</p>

<p>
Once we have reached the breakpoint, we want to check the contents of the array
<code>num</code> to make sure it is fine. Do do that, type the name of the array,
num, in the Watch window (lower right):
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="../images/watch.gif" alt="VS watch window">
</p>

<p>
The value shown is the address of the beginning of the array. Click the plus
sign to the left of <code>num</code> to expand the array and see its contents:
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="../images/watchval.gif" alt="VS watch variable value">
</p>

<p>
Aha! The first element of the array is junk. Why did this happen? Something 
must have gone wrong earlier on. Let's remove this breakpoint since it has
served its purpose: Move the mouse cursor on the line where the breakpoint is,
right-click and select "Remove breakpoint".
</p>

<p>
Now, we are going to go through the program one step at a time.
</p>

<h3>Stepping through the program</h3>

<p>To step through the program, we use the following icons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<img src="../images/stepin.gif" alt="VS step into button"> <b>Step into</b> a statement. 
Used to execute a single
statement. If the statement contains a function call, it will step into the
function.</li>

<li>
<img src="../images/stepover.gif" alt="VS step over button"> <b>Step over</b> a statement. 
Used to execute a single statement and jump to the beginning of the next one. </li>

<li>
<img src="../images/stepout.gif" alt="VS step out button"> <b>Step out</b> of a block. 
Used to step out
of a block. </li>

<li>
<img src="../images/runto.gif" alt="VS run to button"> <b>Run to</b> the cursor. Executes all statements
up to where the cursor is.
</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you click the Step into button at the wrong moment you may 
step into the code for a standard function (such as <code>printf</code>) and 
assembly code will then be displayed:
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="../images/assembly.gif" alt="VS assembly code">
</p>

<p>To exit this code, just click the Step Out icon. 
</p>

<p>
Now, let's stop the debugging process so that we may restart. Click the 
Stop Debugging button: <img src="../images/stop.gif" alt="VS stop button">
</p>

<p>
We are ready to start the step-by-step execution of our program. Click the 
Step Over button until you get to the first <code>for</code>-loop. Make sure you
have <code>num</code> in the watch window and that it is expanded. 
</p>

<p>
Step-Over a couple of times until you get to the <code>scanf</code>. Note that 
once you are there, when you try to step-over again, you can't. This is 
because <code>scanf</code> is waiting for input from the keyboard. Bring the 
I/O window to the top and type 1. 
</p>

<p>
Look at the watch window. num[1] has become 1 whereas all the other slots of
the array contain junk. But the first element 
of the array, the one that should contain the value we entered, is num[0], not
num[1]. Why did the number go into num[1]? Let's look at the leftmost watch 
window which shows the current value of <code>i</code>. It is 1, when it should
have been 0. The debugger told us where the problem is (<code>i</code> contains the
wrong value when the loop begins), now our brain has to figure out why this 
happened and how it can be fixed. The answer in this case is simple. The loop 
should be going from 0 to SIZE-1 and not from 1 to SIZE because the C language
uses zero-indexing for arrays.
</p>

<p>
There are other errors in the program. See if the debugger can help you find 
them.</p>

<h3>The Watch Windows</h3>

<p>As you saw above, there are two watch windows. The leftmost is the one that 
shows the values of the most current variables (those in the current scope). 
Use the rightmost one to watch the values of other variables or to perform 
computations. For example, you may want to watch the value of 
<code>num[0]+num[1]+num[2]</code>:
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="../images/watch2.gif" alt="VS watch expressions">
</p>

<p>Note that the value of <code>i</code> is red. This happens whenever the value
of a variable is updated (to attract your attention).
