<p>
This page describes how to create projects in Dev-C++ for Windows that use
<a href="cs110-glutlib.html">the EECS 110 Graphics Library</a> for simple graphics.
The instructions assume you have
already installed the Dev-C++ library. If you haven't, first follow
<a href="devcpp.html">these instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating a EECS 110 Graphics Project</h2>

<p>A graphics project in Windows is one that opens a special graphics window
in which drawing and mouse actions can happen. Microsoft provides C/C++ functions
for doing this but they are quite complicated to use. The EECS 110 <tt>introGlutLib</tt>
library makes it possible to do simple graphics with less complexity.</p>

<p>The New Project dialog box will appear. Click on the tab at the top labelled
<b>Introduction</b>. This will show project templates designed for
introductory programming. You should see one labelled
<tt>CS110-Graphics</tt>. If you do not, cancel, and re-do
<a href="devcpp.html">the steps for installing the EECS 110 files</a>.</p>

<p>Select the <b>CS110-Graphics</b>
option and enter a name for your project. Here I used <tt>PA3</tt>.
Click <tt>Ok</tt> to create the project. As before, Dev-C++ will
ask you where to save the project. As always, create a new folder
in your EECS 110 code folder,
e.g., <tt>PA3</tt>, open it, and put your project there.</p>

<p>When the project opens, it will contain several (unsaved) files. Three of these
contain the graphics library code. You can look at them, but don't
edit them. The fourth, <tt>main.c</tt>, is where you should put your
code for drawing, handling mouse clicks, and handling key clicks.</p>

<p><strong>Test your new project immediately!</strong> Click the icon
to Compile and Run the project, press the F9 function key, or select 
"Compile and Run" from the <b>Execute</b> menu, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>Dev-C++ will ask you where it should save those files. Just hit
<b>Enter</b> each time to save them in the project folder you just created.
</p>

<p>Dev-C++ will then try to compile and run the new project. If everything
is correctly installed, compilation should run without errors, and 
the application should start and show a green rectangle.</p>

<p>Simply click the mouse or press a key to exit the program. You're now ready to add your
own code. If anything fails, re-check the steps above, read the error message,
ask your partner to help, and if all else fails, post the error messages
to the newsgroup.</p>

<tr class="instruction">

<p>If the new project compiled and ran correctly, then 
create your own code by replacing the code in <tt>main.c</tt>.
Only change the functions you need to, e.g., <tt>myDisplay()</tt>
for drawing things, <tt>myMouse()</tt> if you're doing anything
with mouse clicks, and so on. Remember to always leave at least
one way to exit your program!</p>
