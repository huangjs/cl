<p>
Dev-C++ is a free integrated development environment (IDE) for C and C++ on
Windows. There
are many such environments, such as Microsoft Visual Studio and Codewarrior.
Any IDE can be used for this course.
Most are quite similar to each other. We'll use Dev-C++ in the
class examples. The teaching lab has Microsoft Visual Studio installed.
</p>

<p>Dev-C++ can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>Dev-C++ requires Windows. You need about 9 megabytes
for the download file and 60 megabytes more for the installed IDE.</p>

<h2>Install Dev-C++</h2>

<p>The instructions below should be enough to get you going. 
After you've installed, if you run into problems, check
<a href="http://www14.brinkster.com/aditsu/dev-cpp-faq.html">Aditsu's unofficial Dev-C++ FAQ</a>.</p>

<p class="warning">
Just to be safe, avoid using folders and file names with spaces.
Don't install things in <tt>My Documents</tt> or similar. Put Dev-C++ in a simple location, such as
<tt>C:\Dev-Cpp</tt>. Put your EECS 110 code in a simple location, such
as <tt>C:\Courses\EECS110</tt>. Don't
put your own code inside the Dev-C++ folder. You may lose your work if you
have to reinstall Dev-C++.
</p>


<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">the Dev-C++ home page</a>.</li>

<li>Follow the links to download the most recent "beta" version
of Dev-C++.</li>

<li>Run the file that you downloaded. In general, choose the default options
when asked. When it lists what files to install, you can uncheck "Language files"
if you're not going to be working with anything besides English.</li>

<li>When the installer offers to start Dev-C++, do so. Dev-++ will ask
you some questions the first time you use it. Once again,
choose the default options.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Install the EECS 110 Files</h2>

<p>Download <a href="../code/devcpp-templates.zip">the EECS 110 archive</a>. 
This is a Zip archive. It's a file that contains compressed (smaller) versions
of other files.
Windows XP has built-in support for getting files out of  Zip archives. If
you have an older Windows, you can use WinZip or ZipGenius or any of a number
of Zip archive utilities.

<p>Put all the files in the archive <em>except <tt>glut32.dll</tt></em>
into the folder <tt>C:\Dev-C++\Templates\</tt>. (Modify this path
if you put Dev-C++ somewhere else.) In Windows XP, you can just copy and paste, or
drag and drop, the files in the archive to the <tt>Templates</tt> folder.
If you're using a utility, use the <b>Extract</b> command.</p>

<p>Put the file <tt>glut32.dll</tt> into your 
Windows <tt>system32</tt> directory. This is most likely
<tt>C:\Windows\system32</tt>. If you have an older version of
Windows XP or NT, it might be <tt>C:\WINNT\system32</tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="default-dir"></a>Create An EECS 110 Project Directory</h2>

<p>Create a folder (directory) in Windows where you
will keep all your code, e.g.,  <tt>C:\Courses\EECS110\Code</tt>.</p>

<p>Start Dev-C++.</p>

<p>The Environment Options dialog box will appear. Click on the tab labelled
<b>Files &amp; Dir...</b>. To tell Dev-C++ to always start looking
for files in your EECS 110 directory, click
on the small "folder selector" icon next to <tt>User's Default Directory</tt>
field. This will open a file dialog box that will let you navigate to
and select your code directory.</p>

<p>After you have found and selected your directory, click <tt>Ok</tt> to choose
it, then click <tt>Ok</tt> again to close the Environment Options dialog box.</p>

<h2>How to Create a Project</h2>

<p>In Dev-C++ and most other development environments, 
you create a <em>project</em>
for each application you build. A project is a small file
that lists the code files needed to make the application,
plus various settings for compiling those files.
The steps below
show how to create a project in Dev-C++. Other IDE's
are very similar.</p>

<p>The simplest kind of project to build
is one that does all its input and output in a console
window, e.g., the Command Prompt window in Windows.
Such programs are simple to set up, but are a bit old-fashioned.</p>

<table class="instructions">

<tr class="instruction">
<td class="text">
<p>Start Dev-C++, click on the <b>File</b> menu, then on <b>New</b>, then
on <b>Project ...</b>. </p>

<p>The New Project dialog box will appear.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click on the <b>Introduction</b> tab.</li>

<li>Click on the icon that says <b>EECS 110 Console</b>.</li>

<li>Enter a name for this project, e.g., <tt>PA1</tt>
for Programming Assignment #1.</li>

<li>Check <b>C Project</b> and <b>Make Default Language</b>.
That way, Dev-C++ will know you normally
want to make C files, not C++ files.</li>

<li>Click <tt>Ok</tt> to create the project.</li>
</ul>

<tr class="instruction">
<td class="text">
<p>Dev-C++ will ask where you want to save the project. If you
<a href="#default-dir">set the default directory correctly</a>, you should already be
in your EECS 110 code directory. Click on the "new folder" icon
to create a new folder, give the folder a name, e.g., the same
name as your project, wait for Windows to create the folder,
then click the <b>Open</b> button to open that folder. Save
the project file and all code files in this new folder.</p>

<p>The project file will have a <tt>.dev</tt>
extension. You can double-click that file in the future to
reopen your project from Windows.</p>

<p>Now you should see a project screen. The name of your
project should appear in the Project Browser on the left.
The template automatically creates a file <tt>main.c</tt>
for this project. For many assignments, all you'll need to
do is edit this file.</p>

<p>Now you can type code into this window, save it, and compile it.</p>

<p>For illustration, I've typed in a simple Hello World program. Note
that the Dev-C++ editor knows about C syntax, and has colored different
kinds of code differently. It also knows how to indent code. Let the editor
do the work. Trust it. If something indents where you don't expect,
or doesn't have the color you expect, you probably typed something wrong.</p>

<p>To compile and run your program, the obvious choice is to select
<b>Compile &amp; Run</b> from the <b>Execute</b> menu, or click
but even simpler, once you learn where it is,
the <b>Compile &amp; Run</b> icon.</p>

<p>When you do this, Dev-C++ will ask you where you want to save the
code file and what name to call it, if the file hasn't already been saved.
You can call the file anything. I called mine <tt>pa1</tt> and saved it
as <tt>pa1.c</tt> in my EECS 110 code directory, but another good
name would be <tt>main.c</tt> because this is the file with the
<tt>main()</tt> function.</p>

<p>Ooops! When I clicked the <b>Compile &amp; Run</b> icon, I saw a dialog
box appear indicating that the code was being compiled, and a window
flashed by, but I didn't see any input. What happened?</p>

<p>What happened was that Windows opened a Command Prompt window, ran my code, and then,
because the program was done, immediately closed the window. 
This is a common "gotcha" with Windows. It's one of the FAQ's in
the Dev-C++ Help material. The trick is to make Dev-C++ stop our program
just before it calls <tt>return</tt> at the end.</p>

<p>To do that, put your cursor anywhere on the line with the <tt>return 0</tt>.
Then click on the purple Debug check mark at the bottom of the screen. A
set of buttons will appear for running your program in Debug mode.</p>

<p>Now when I click on <tt>Run to cursor</tt>, the
window opens, shows my output, and stays open until I return

<p>Note: the console window might appear behind the Dev-C++
window. Just move things around to see it.</p>
