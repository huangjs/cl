<H3>C Software</H3>

<P>There are two recommended ways to compile and run C code in
this course, if you are on a Windows machine.</P>

<ul>
<li>Download and install the Dev-C++ compiler. This is
similar to Visual Studio (see below), but smaller and completely free. It
has some limitations, but is more than enough for our needs.</li>

<li>Use Microsoft Visual Studio for C++ 6.0, which
is already installed in most of the labs on campus.</li>

<!--
<li>Download and install a free temporary edition of Visual Studio from the
<A href="http://msdn06.e-academy.com/elms/Storefront/Home.aspx?campus=northwestern_cs">MSDNAA</A>
site. This requires a CS account, which you should have received (or will soon receive)
in an email from us. At the moment, unfortunately, there are some technical problems
with the MSDNAA server.</li> -->
</ul>

<p>If you use Visual Studio, use <a href="msvs.html">these instructions</a> for compiling code.</p>

<p>If you use Dev-C++, use <a href="devcpp.html">these instructions</a> for compiling code<P>

<H3>How to submit your work</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Only submit the <TT>.C</TT> and (if any) <TT>.h</TT> files that you have
written. </li>
<LI> Combine the files to be submitted into a zip file named
<TT>firstname_lastname_pa?.zip</TT> where <TT>?</TT> is the number of the
current assignment.
To zip the files use a utility like <A href="http://www.winzip.com" >Winzip</A>
<a href="http://www.filzip.com/">Filzip</a>, or
<a href="http://www.tugzip.com/">TUGzip</a>. If you use the built-in file compressor in Windows,
make sure you know what you're doing!</li>

<LI> Email your file as an attachment to
<A href="mailto:c-riesbeck@northwestern.edu">c-riesbeck@northwestern.edu</A>.
Make sure you copy the email to yourself and then check to see whether the
attachment has been sent correctly.</li>

<LI> You should receive a confirmation within 24 hours at the latest. This will
only acknowledge receipt of your email. We will not check the attachment at
that time, so make sure everything is there. If there is any problem, email
me at <A href="mailto:c-riesbeck@northwestern.edu">c-riesbeck@northwestern.edu</A>.
<b>Important: Put "EECS 110:" in the Subject line.</b> </li>

<H3>How to get help</H3>

<P>
Programming can be very time consuming. Always start your assignments as early
as possible. If you do get stuck, do NOT waste hours on a single error. Instead,
get help. The fastest way is to check the newsgroup. Chances are someone else
has had the same problem as you and can give you a hint. Tips, clarifications
and answers will also be posted by the staff. You may discuss the homework
with other students in the newsgroup as long as you <b> never post anything
that will be graded</b>.
</P>

<P>
The TAs will have regular office hours at the lab, where you can get them to
look at your work in progress and offer you hints and useful programming tips.
Take advantage of that.
</P>

<P>
Grading guidelines will be included in the assignment handouts. For information
on regrading and late submission see under <A href="info.html">Info</A>
