<h2> <A name="prereq"> Prerequisites </A> </h2>

<P>
There are no prerequisites for this class. No previous knowledge of
programming is assumed.

<h2> <A name="book"> Textbook </A> </h2>

<P>
The textbook for this class is
<a href="http://www.course.com/catalog/product.cfm?isbn=978-0-534-49132-1&amp;CFID=19394294&amp;CFTOKEN=73003176">
<em>Computer Science: A Structured Programming Approach Using C, Third Edition</em></a>
by Behrouz A. Forouzan and Richard F. Gilberg.
</P>

<P>
The source code for the examples in the book can be
downloaded from the publisher
<a href="http://www.course.com/studentcenter/downloads.cfm?isbn=978-0-534-49132-1&amp;CFID=19374237&amp;CFTOKEN=80755094">

<h2> <A name="regrades"> Regrading requests </A> </h2>

<P>
Requests for regrades must be submitted <b>no later
</b> than one week after the graded paper was handed back to you. There will be
no exceptions to this rule. At the end of the quarter you will be given
a chance to review your final exam before the letter grades are submitted.
</P>

<hr>
<h2> <A name="late"> Late submission </A> </h2>

<P>
Please start your programming assignments <b>EARLY</b>.
Programs always take more time than you think they will.
</P>

<P>
Late programming assignments will not be penalized as long as the total
late hours for the <b>whole</b> quarter do not exceed 96. After those "free"
hours have been used up, you must submit your assignments before the due date
for them to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Extensions will not be given unless one of the following applies:
<UL>
  <LI> Serious personal problems (e.g. <em>serious</em> illness).     Documentation is required.
  <LI> <em>Extended</em> lab downtime.
</UL>

<P>
If you are scheduled to be out of town on the day or week when the assignment
is due (e.g. interview trip, participation in sports event) you must make arrangements for
turning in your assignments. We realize that such situations or heavy load
for other
courses may force you to turn some assignments late. This is why we have
the 96-late hour policy.
</P>

<P>
<b>Keep frequent backups of your work on floppy disks or other machines.</b>
 There will be no extension if
you accidentally lose your files.
</P>

<hr>
<h2> <A name="cheating"> Cheating </A> </h2>
<P>
You must <b> never </b> copy solutions from any source or make your homework
available, in any form, to anyone other than the professor or TA. <p>
</P>

<P>
<b> Cheating will result in a failing grade for the course.</b>
 University policy requires that graduate students who are caught cheating
be reported to the graduate school and undergraduates to the Dean.<p>
</P>
<P>
However, you are allowed and encouraged to discuss the assignments.
This means asking for suggestions when you are stuck and discussing
examples that are not part of the assignment. You must never share code
or solutions to the assigned problems.
</P>

<hr>
<h2><a name="pairs"></a>Pair Programming</h2>

<p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgramming">Pair programming</a>
is not required but <b>strongly</b> recommended
for most assignments. More and more studies are showing
the benefits of pair programming not only in software development, but
in <a href="http://www2.umassd.edu/SWPI/xp/pairprogramming.html">introductory computer science courses</a>.
</p>

<p>
A good description of how
pair programming is done is
<a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/talks/macalester-xp/pairs-basics-1.html">here</a>.
We'll practice pair programming in the lab.</p>


<p class="warn"><a name="pair-rules"></a>If you pair program, <b>you must follow the rules below</b>.
Not doing so will be treated as <a href="#cheating">cheating</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a partner <b>before</b> writing any code. Make sure the two
of you can schedule at least 4 hours of meetings to program together.
Each meeting should be between 1 to 2 hours. How much time you'll actually
need will vary widely from pair to pair and assignment to assignment.</li>

<li>Read the assignment before you meet. Write down any questions
you have about what you need to do. <em>Do not write any code.</em></li>

<li>When you meet, follow the rules for
<a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/talks/macalester-xp/pairs-basics-1.html">
pair programming</a>. That means switching every 15 minutes or so,
and the "observer" is an <em>active</em> contributor to the process.</li>

<li>All programming
must be done in the pair. Do not continue programming outside the
pair.
<ul>
<li>If you can't finish in one session, meet again.</li>
<li>If that's impossible, save a copy of the code you pair-programmed for
separate submission. Then work alone to finish the code.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>When you submit your code, you must include both programmers
as authors in the head comments.</li>
</ul>

<h2> <A name="help"> How to make the most out of this class </A> </h2>

<UL>
<LI> Participate in class. Ask lots of questions.
<LI> Study the textbook. It is very well written with good examples.
<LI> Check the class webpage often. The <A href="links.html">Help</A> section
 contains lots of
helpful information.
<LI> Start your assignments early. Ambitious programming can be <b>very</b>
time consuming.  Even though something may seem simple in principle, sometimes
it takes quite a while to code.
<LI> Do not get stuck for too long on your homework without asking the professor
or TA for help.
<LI> Use the newsgroup to ask questions about the assignments or the material.
Often, you will get a reply much faster than if you emailed the staff directly.
<LI> Don't hesitate to come to office hours if you have additional questions
on the material.
<LI> Do not wait until the day before the final to ask for help in the
  class! Even if you learn it then, you won't have any practice at using
  what you learned.
<LI> If you must get a specific final grade (e.g. due to a scholarship or
academic probation) let me know at the beginning of the quarter so that
I can help you achieve your goal - this means I'll help you learn: I will NOT
grade your work differently.
<LI> Finally, no course gives individuals the option to improve a grade
by doing additional work.
