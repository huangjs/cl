<DIV ID="banner">Assignment 1: Set up Lisp</DIV>

<P>Your goal in this assignment is to set up the Lisp environment you'll be using for
the rest of this class.</P>

<H2>Set up Common Lisp</H2>

<P>If you have no preference about Lisp's, install Allegro Common Lisp. It's
available
at <a href="http://www.franz.com">Franz, Inc.</a>.
This will be the Lisp that most students will be using, so you'll
get the best local support if you run into trouble.
</P>

<blockquote class="quote">Allegro comes with two versions: ANSI, which implements
the Common Lisp standard, and Modern, which implements a non-standard version
compatible with Java libraries. Each version can be run with or without
the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). If you use Allegro, be sure
to use an ANSI image. I recommend the ANSI IDE. You will get errors with
standard third-party libraries if you use a Modern image.</blockquote>


<P>You can use any other Common Lisp that is listed as supported by the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/">portable AllegroServe</a>
library for
Lisp-based web services.</P>

<P>Scheme is not suitable for this course.</P>

<H2>Test Lisp</H2>

<P>Before doing anything else, try starting Lisp, as appropriate
for the platform you're on and the Lisp you installed. In Windows,
you can start Allegro Common Lisp from the <b>Start</b> menu.</P>

<p>Type a few simple expressions, e.g., <code>(* 23 45)</code>,
just to make sure everything is working.</p>

<p>If you have problems, <a href="#help">ask for help</a>.</p>

<H2>Install the CS 325 Code</H2>

<P>Make a CS 325 directory, e.g., in Windows, it might be
<code>c:\cs325</code>.</P>

<P>Download <a href="../../programs/cs325.zip">cs325.zip</a>. Unzip
the contents of that file into your CS325 directory.</P>

<H2>Test the CS 325 Code</H2>

<P>Start your Lisp and load the file
<code><a href="../../programs/cs325.lisp">cs325.lisp</a></code>. This
file is included in
<code><a href="../../programs/cs325.zip">cs325.zip</a></code>.</p>

<p>
If your Lisp has a visual interface, there will be a menu item under
<b>File</b> for loading files. Otherwise, use</p>

<blockquote><pre>(load "c:/cs325/cs325.lisp")</pre></blockquote>

<p>replacing <code>c:/cs325/cs325.lisp</code> with whatever location
you extracted the CS 325 files to.</p>

<p class="quote">Note: When specifying pathnames in strings,
use "/" as the directory separator, not "\". Lisp, Java, and C++
all recognize "/" as a directory separator, whether you're running
on Windows, Unix, or MacOS. "\" on the other hand is only valid for
Windows pathnames, and, because it is used in Lisp, Java
and C++ to mark special characters, you have to write "\\". So,
keep it simple -- use "/".</p>

<p>If you get any error messages, see below for how to get help.</P>

<P>If everything seems to load OK, type:</P>

<blockquote><pre>(in-package :cs325-user)</pre></blockquote>

<P>followed by a carriage return. In Allegro, the prompt should now indicate
that you're in <tt>CS325-USER</tt>.</P>

<P>Type:</P>

<blockquote><pre>(critique (defun foo (x) (setq x (+ x 1))))
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If all has been set up correctly, the above should cause several
critiques of the above code to appear.</p>

<p>Then type</p>

<blockquote><pre>(get-tests)</pre></blockquote>

<p>A list of several lines long of about 60 names should be returned.</p>

<p>If any of the above tests does something unexpected,
<a href="#help">ask for help</a>.</p>

<h2>Making Lisp Life Easier (optional but recommended)</h2>

<p>If the CS325 code is working, you can tell many Lisp's to load
the file automatically every time you start Lisp. These Lisp's load
some initialization file
every time they start. The name and location of this file varies
from OS to OS and Lisp to Lisp.</p>

<p>I have made some sample startup files for Allegro and LispWorks.
The table below summarizes where they should be placed. Whichever
one you use, <em>you must modify one line</em>, as marked in the file,
to specify where you installed the CS 325 code.</p>

<table align="center" border="1" summary="initialization data">
<tr>
<th>Lisp</th><th>Operating System</th><th>Startup File</th><th>Where to Put</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Allegro Common Lisp</td>
<td>Windows</td>
<td><a href="../../programs/startups/startup.cl"><tt>startup.cl</tt></a></td>
<td>Allegro directory, e.g.,<br><tt>C:\Program Files\acl62\startup.cl</tt></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Allegro Common Lisp</td>
<td>Linux</td>
<td><a href="../../programs/startups/clinit.cl"><tt>clinit.cl</tt></a></td>
<td>your home directory, i.e.,<br><tt>~/clinit.cl</tt></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LispWorks</td>
<td>Windows</td>
<td><a href="../../programs/startups/lww-init.lisp"><tt>lww-init.lisp</tt></a></td>
<td>your home directory, e.g.,<br><tt>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your-name</em>\lww-init.lisp</tt></td>
</table>

<p class="quote">LispWorks Personal Edition does not automatically
load any file on start up. But if you put the start up file in the
directory given, it will be immediately available when you do
<b>File | Load...</b>.</p>

<p>If you are using some other Common Lisp, find out what file it
loads at start up time and modify it to do what
<a href="../../programs/startup.cl"><tt>startup.cl</tt></a> does.</p>

<p class="quote">Even when <code>cs325.lisp</code> is loaded automatically,
you still have to type <code>(in-package :cs325-user)</code>
to access the CS 325 functions.
I have not found any simple way to
automatically set the user package inside <tt>cs325.lisp</tt>.</p>

<H2>How to Get Help</H2>

<P>There's a lot of ways to make trivial errors in configuring
any language environment, and most of them lead to fairly
cryptic messages and behavior.</P>

<P>The best source of help will be <a href="news:cs.325">the CS 325 news group</a>.</P>

<ul>
<li>Look to see if someone else had the same
problem you did, and what answers they got.</li>
<li>If your problem is a new one, POST your problem. Be specific
about what platform you're on, e.g., Windows XP, Linux, ...
Copy and paste the error message, if any.</li>
<li>If you've seen that problem and know the solution,
POST the answer. <em>Helpful postings can increase your grade!</em></li>
</ul>
