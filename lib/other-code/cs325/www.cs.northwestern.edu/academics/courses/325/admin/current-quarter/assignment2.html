<H2>Set up AllegroServe</H2>

<p>
If you are using Allegro Common Lisp, then you already have the AllegroServe
code on your machine, you just need to tell Allegro to load it. To do that
type the following in Lisp, or put it in your <tt>startup.cl</tt> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(require :aserve)</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you are using another Lisp, then you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/">portable AllegroServe</a>.
This comes in a Unix gzip tar file. WinZip and similar utilities know how
to extract the files in a tar file. Read the <tt>README</tt> and
<tt>INSTALL.lisp</tt> files for information on how to load these
files into your Lisp. Basically, if you load <tt>INSTALL.lisp</tt>
it should compile and load the server code for you.
</li>

<li>
For help, go to <a href="news:cs.325">the CS 325 news server</a>.
Be specific about what operating
system and Lisp you're using.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Test AllegroServe</h2>

<p>
Follow the steps given in my lecture notes on
<a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/web-servers.html#use">
Lisp Web Servers</a>. Specifically,
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Start the server.</li>

<li>Start a browser</li>

<li>Give the browser the URL
<a href="http://localhost:8000/critic">
http://localhost:8000/critic</a> (assuming 8000 is the port number
you chose)</li>

<li>Type several Lisp expressions and make sure they get evaluated.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Submit Report</H2>

<P>Email to

   <LI>a statement that you personally have set up and tested AllegroServe
   -- watching someone else do it doesn't come close to counting</LI>

<H2>Where to get help</H2>

<P>As before, the best source of help will
be <A HREF="news:cs.325">the CS 325 newsgroup</A>.
Make sure your newsreader is finding <b>all</b>
messages, including old ones.
</P>

<ul>
<li>Look to see if someone else had the same
problem you did, and what answers they got.</li>
<li>If your problem is a new one, POST your problem. Be specific
about what platform you're on, e.g., Windows XP, Linux, ...
Copy and paste the error message, if any.</li>
<li>If you've seen that problem and know the solution,
POST the answer. <em>Helpful postings can increase your grade!</em></li>
</ul>
