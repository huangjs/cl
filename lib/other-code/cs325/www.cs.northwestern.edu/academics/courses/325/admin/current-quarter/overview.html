<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>You learn by doing. There are two kinds of doing in this class:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the class project

   <LI>personal exploration of the chapters and exercises in Graham
   and the other resources
</UL>

<P>Both are critical. You will be graded on the level of effort you
put in <em>both</em> activities. I hope you find both to be fun, challenging, and
motivating.</P>

<P>The first thing to read is
<a href="../grading.html">how you submit work for review</a>.
This information is <b>critical</b>!

<H2>The Class Project</H2>

<P>Class lectures and class assignments will be organized around the
class project. The class project will be some sort of intelligent
web-based information system, but exactly what will be determined
in class discussions, as we try to answer
<strong>the AI question</strong>.
</P>

<a name="whatisai"><P>The AI question, by the way, is not</p>

<p class="quote">What is intelligence?</p>

<p>
It's</p>

<p class="quote">Why are computers so stupid?</p#0066cc>

<p>Answer the first question and you still don't know what to do.
Answer the second question and you have an AI thesis.</p>

<p>So we'll be asking the question "Why is the web so stupid?" and
once we have an answer, we'll have a programming project.</p>

<HR>

<H2>Personal Exploration</H2>

<P>Everyone has different things they like to do, and different
learning styles. In parallel with the class-driven project, you
should also be moving as quickly as possibly through Paul Graham's
<B>ANSI Common Lisp</B>. You should finish that book by quarter's end
at least, though many of you will be done with it sooner.</P>

<P>To paraphrase Yoda from <B>Star Wars</B>:</P>

<p class="quote">Reading means nothing. There is only doing.
</p>

<P>Do the exercises at the end of each chapter and in the various
exercise files. If you have trouble, email your problems to
<a href="mailto:c25@cs.northwestern.edu">c25</a>. Put something like
"Question about Ex xxx" in the Subject.
</P>

<P>Use <A HREF="../grading.html#queue-rules">the rules for
submission</A> to decide when your answers qualify for submitting to
me. <B>Do not send answers to every exercise to me.</B> Many
exercises are simply too trivial to merit submission.</P>

<P>Pay particular attention to the example applications in Graham,
such as the HTML generator (Chapter 16) and the Ray Tracer (Chapter
9). Pick one or two that particularly interest you and generate your
own exercises from them. For example, the string substitution
application (Chapter 7) is a fine place to start to build a tool for
updating links in HTML files (you'll need to add a HTML parser for
tags).</P>
<H2>Where to get help:</H2>

<P>There's a lot of ways to make trivial errors in configuring
any language environment, and most of them lead to fairly
cryptic messages and behavior.</P>

<P>The best source of help will be <a href="news:cs.325">the CS 325 news group</a>.</P>

<ul>
<li>Look to see if someone else had the same
problem you did, and what answers they got.</li>
<li>If your problem is a new one, POST your problem. Be specific
about what platform you're on, e.g., Windows XP, Linux, ...
Copy and paste the error message, if any.</li>
<li>If you've seen that problem and know the solution,
POST the answer. <em>Helpful postings can increase your grade!</em></li>
</ul>
