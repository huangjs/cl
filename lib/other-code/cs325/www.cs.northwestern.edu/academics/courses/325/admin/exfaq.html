<H2>The Answers</H2>

<H3><A NAME="how-many"></A>How many submissions do I have to do?
</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Do 2 to 3 <B>new</B> submissions per week, plus fixing
your old code. With 10 weeks in the quarter that typically leads to
close to 30 exercises plus their resubmissions, which usually means
50 or more emails total. This is <B>not</B> a guarantee nor a hard
and fast formula. Everyone's case is different. I grade based on
<B>effort</B> and <B>learning</B>. Therefore, I expect more from
someone who starts with more advanced skills who can get good code
done in 1 or 2 tries, than I do from someone who starts with less
experience and needs practise.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="wait"></A>How many submissions can I send at once?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>You can have up to 3 <B>new</B> pieces of code in the queue. You can have 
    more than 3 things in the queue that I haven't gotten to yet, but at most 
    3 of them can be things I've never seen before. There's no limit on resubmissions.</P>
  <P><B>Never</B> send more than one submission in an email.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><a name="do-all"></a>Do I have to do all the exercises in every chapter?</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The goal is to show me the breadth and depth of your AI programming skills. 
    That means showing you know when and how to write good recursive, iterative, 
    and mapping code, numeric code, macros, and so on. In the first part of the 
    course, you work on these generic skills. In the second, you work on applying 
    them to AI-related problems. Don't get hung up on one thing. Stop occasionally 
    and look over what you've sent to make sure you've covered the major topics.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="dont-understand"></A>What do I do if I don't understand
an submission?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Send me email 
    or post to <a href="news:cs.325">the CS 325 news server</a>. Put "<TT>HELP: Ex. <em>name 
    of exercise</em></TT>" in the <B>Subject</B> field.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><A NAME="resubmit"></A>Can I fix and resubmit a submission?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Absolutely. This is strongly encouraged. Just don't
fall behind with the new submissions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="quickly"></A>How quickly will I get a response?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>At best, less than a day. At worst, 3 or 4 days. It
depends on my workload and how fast submissions are coming in.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="teams-ok"></A>Is it OK to work in teams?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><b>No!</b> Every submission you send me should be your own
personal answer.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="make-up"></A>Can I make up my own submissions?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yes, but each one must be approved first. Email me. Put
"<TT>EECS 325 Exercise Proposal</TT>" in the <B>Subject</B> field.</P>
