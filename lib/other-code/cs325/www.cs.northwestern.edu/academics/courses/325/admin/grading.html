<h2>What you do, how I grade</h2>

<P>Treat this course like a job. Your grade is your performance
evaluation. The key performance measures are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>maintainability of code produced
   
   <LI>quality (correctness) of code produced
   
   <LI>quantity of code produced
</UL>


<P>One goal for this course is to improve the <I>maintainability</I>
of your code. To do that, this course replaces the standard two-step
"code - grade" pattern with a cycle of "code - critique - revise."
</P>

<h2>The Cycle</h2>

<P>Here's how the course works, as far as coding and grading:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>You send me a <I>short</I> piece of <I>working</I> code
   relevant to the topics of this course. It might be from a
   recommended exercise, the project, or some other relevant course.
   
   <LI>I send your code back with detailed critiques.
   
   <LI>You respond to all of the critiques by revising and
   resubmitting your code.
   
   <LI>We repeat this cycle until I tell you to move on.
</UL>

<P>Normally, you should have two or three cycles going at on at once,
involving different pieces of code.</P>

<P>See <a href="exfaq.html">the Email FAQ</a> for common questions about this process.</P>

<a name="queue"></a>
<H2>The Queue</H2>

<P style="background-color: lightgrey; text-align: center"><B>NEW! NEW! NEW!</b></p>

<p>The email-based queue is being replaced with web-based system. To access it,
click on this link to 
<a href="https://arch.northwestern.edu/portal/site/2007WI_EECS_325-1_SEC20/">the EECS 325 Arch Home Page</a>. 
Log in with your netid, then
click on the Code Critic link on the left. After that, things should be obvious.</p>


<P><a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~riesbeck/">Email me</a> 
for things requiring immediate attention, e.g., "the web server
is down." Always put EECS 325 in the Subject.
</P>

<P>Don't mix these up. If you send urgent messages to the queue, I
may not see it for several days. If you send code to my personal
address, I will forward it to the queue and you end up later in the
queue than you would have had you sent it directly there.</P>

<H2><A NAME="queue-rules"></A>The Rules of the Queue</H2>

<P>Here are the rules for normal email submissions, in one quick
list:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Short code only</B> -- no more than a dozen lines of code.
   
   <LI><B>No attachments</B> -- copy and paste code into the body of
   the message.
   
   <LI><B>No untested code</B> -- I really really hate getting code
   that doesn't run.
   
   <LI><B>No output</B> -- unless you demonstrating a function you've
   invented for yourself.
   
   <LI><B>No test cases or code</B> -- testing is good, 
   automated test is great,
   but don't send the code to do it to me.
   
   <LI><B>One exercise to a message</B>.
   
   <LI><B>Identify the exercise in the Subject</B>.
   
   <LI><B>Don't repeat yourself</B> -- each submission should
   demonstrate something new.
   
   <LI><B>Don't repeat me</B> -- don't include previous email between
   us, except for specific questions.
   
   <LI><B>Don't get ahead of me</B> -- at most 3 brand-new items in
   the queue (no limit on resubmissions).
</UL>

<P>In slightly more depth:</P>

<DL>
   <DT><B>Keep submissions short.</B>
   
   <DD>Each submission should be no more than a dozen lines of code.
   I neither need, want, nor can handle long code files for
   critiquing.
   
   <DT><B>Keep submissions coherent.</B>
   
   <DD>Each submission should be about one thing. Don't cram several
   exercises together. If piece of stand-alone code is only one or
   two lines, it may not be worth submtting in the first place.
   
   <DT><B>Keep submissions interesting.</B>
   
   <DD>There's no point to sending me code that was trivial for you
   to do. It proves nothing about what you know. If everything in the
   textbook was easy, let me know. I'm sure I can challenge you.
   
   <DT><B>Submit at a steady pace.</B>
   
   <DD>Send no more than 2 to 3 pieces of <b>new</b> code a week. If you send
   less, you'll fall behind and fail. If you send more, you'll be
   sending too many pieces of code with the same mistake repeated
   over and over.
   
   <DT><B>Send only working code.</B>
   
   <DD>Test your code on more than one example. If something happens
   that you can't figure out, contact your TA. Code that doesn't work
   is returned with the comment "This doesn't work. Did you test it?"
   Sending it wasted your time and mine.
   
   <DT><B>Use copy and paste, not attachments.</B>
   
   <DD>Include your code directly in your message. It takes me twice
   as long to reply to code stored in attachments. <B>Don't
   retype</B> -- you'll introduce mistakes and differences and I'll
   be critiquing the wrong thing.
   
   <DT><B>Identify the exercise in the Subject line.</B>
   
   <DD>I use the Subject lines to quickly find previous submissions.
   Seeing Chap 3, Ex 5 in the subject line makes life a lot easier
   for me.
   
   <DT><B>Don't include prior submissions or my replies.</B>
   
   <DD>I have all our email and will compare as necessary. Only
   include notes from me when you have a particular question about
   something.
   
   <DT><B>Don't get backed up.</B>
   
   <DD>If you get backed up and then send a ton of stuff, it won't
   help. I put long submissions (more than a dozen lines of code) and
   excess submissions (more than 3 or 4 from the same person) at the
   end of the queue.
</DL>

<H2>Key Features of the Cycle</H2>

<DL>
   <DT><B>No grades.</B>
   
   <DD>I only critique, I don't grade the email. Your grade for the
   course is based on how much better your codng is by the end of the
   quarter compared to where you started.
   
   <DT><B>No hardcopy.</B>
   
   <DD>All work is submitted by email.
   
   <DT><B>No class-wide homework assignments.</B>
   
   <DD>The only assignments I give to the class as a whole are things
   to do in preparation for the next class meeting. These are
   separate from the email/critique/review cycle.
   
   <DT><B>No due dates.</B>
   
   <DD>However, if you sending me less than 2 to 3 things a week,
   you're in trouble.
</DL>

<h2>The Skills</h2>

<P>The skills to be demonstrated can be measured along these
dimensions:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Maintainability of code produced:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Readability: Good names, the
      <A HREF="../readings/cardinal-rule.html">Cardinal Rule of
      Functions</A>, good use of whitespace, "short attention span
      programming"
      
      <LI>Modularity: coherent modules, well-defined module
      interfaces, no unnecessary shared global variables
      
      <LI>Appropriateness: appropriate use of built-in Common Lisp
      functions, data structure, and control flow constructs
      
      <LI>Documentation: commenting (what not how)
   </UL>
   
   <LI>Quality of code produced:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Coverage: range of inputs handled, errors handled
      
      <LI>Adequacy: appropriate depth of representation, range of
      inferences supported, "thickness of interface"
   </UL>
   
   <LI>Quantity of code produced:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>This is the least interesting dimension, but if you're not
      writing very much, or take forever to do something simple, then
      there's a problem.
   </UL>
</UL>

<h2>When you get stuck</h2>

<P>If you have trouble with some piece of code,</P>

<UL>
   <LI>narrow the problem down to the smallest code you can
   
   <LI>email it and a log of the input/output to your TA.
</UL>

<P>If you're working on a window-based system, you can probably use
cut and paste to get the input/output log.</P>

<P>If not, use Common Lisp's <code>dribble</code> function like this:
</P>

<PRE><i>...load your code...</i>
(dribble "buglog")
<i>...type in example that doesn't work...</i>
(dribble)
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The first call to <code>dribble</code> starts saving all input/output
to the file <code>log-file</code>. You can use any legal file name here.
The second call to <code>dribble</code> turns off logging and closes the
file. You can then copy or include that file in your message to the
TA's.</P>

<P>Narrowing down the source of a problem is one of the key skills in
programming. Often, once you've found the expression that causes the
problem, the reason is obvious. Even if it's not to you, the TA or I
can figure out what's going on much more quickly from two lines of
code than ten.</P>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>"xxx doesn't seem to work" messages are absolutely
useless, and will be returned with an annoying equally useless
comment to that effect.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
