<P>This course is about programming and artificial intelligence.
Depending on what school you're at, that could mean robots, neural
networks, chess playing, etc.</P>

<P>At <EM>this</EM> school, this course is about</P>

<UL>
   <LI>designing and implementing intelligent components for
   interactive distributed computational media</LI>
   
   <LI>developing tools for authoring the knowledge needed by
   such systems</LI>
   
   <LI>doing it all with <I>maintainable</I> code</LI>
</UL>

<P>In particular, the main topic areas of this course are</P>

<UL>
   <LI>symbolic knowledge representation techniques using Common Lisp</LI>
   
   <LI>software engineering</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Symbolic Knowledge Representation</H2>

<P>This will include</P>

<UL>
   <LI>using <A HREF="../readings/mops.html">frames</A> to represent
   real world concepts</LI>
   
   <LI>organizing those frames into taxonomic hierarchies</LI>
   
   <LI>frame and pattern-based inferencing</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Software Engineering</H2>

<P>Software engineering studies and manipulates the software
development process. Programming is just one small part of that
process:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Before programming, there's requirements gathering and design.</LI>
   
   <LI>During programming, there's prototyping and usability testing.</LI>
   
   <LI>After programming, there's validation, deployment,
   maintenance, extension, and, eventually, replacement.</LI>
</UL>

<P>This is a course on programming, not the entire development
process, but it's about programming as a part of this process. This
is not a course about throw-away code. Your coding will be evaluated
on how well it supports testing and validation, team development,
maintenance, and extension.</P>

<P>There are three fundamental criteria by which code is measured:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>correctness-- does the code do what it's supposed to?</LI>
   
   <LI>efficiency -- does the code run fast enough?</LI>
   
   <LI>clarity -- is the code easy to understand?</LI>
</UL>

<P>For this class, the most important feature of your code is
<I>clarity</I>.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If code is clear but buggy, it can be corrected.</LI>
   
   <LI>If code is clear but slow, it can be optimized.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Scaling Up</H3>

<P>Large knowledge-based systems need lots of knowledge. That means
you need to be able to build <I>knowledge-management tools</I> that
many people can use to enter and manage large bodies of knowledge.
</P>

<P>This class will discuss the following techniques for
knowledge-management:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>domain-specific mini-languages (macros, patterns, rules)</LI>
   
   <LI>knowledge management interfaces</LI>
   
   <LI>knowledge debuggers</LI>
</UL>

<P>Large knowledge-based systems also need to work in a timely
fashion. As knowledge bases get large, the simple approaches become
too slow for practical use.</P>

<H3>Speeding Up</H3>

<P>This class will discuss the following techniques for speeding up
knowledge-based systems:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>discrimination trees</LI>
   
   <LI>pattern and rule compilers</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Sending out</H3>

<P>Delivered knowledge-based systems have to be maintainable, robust,
and accessible to users.</P>

<P>Robustness means (1) the code as delivered works as promised, over
a wide variety of situations, and (2) continues to work as promised
when changed.</P>

<P>All systems have to be changed, but change is especially rapid and
dramatic in knowledge-based systems, which are often the first of
their kind in some application area.</P>

<P>The problem is ensuring the changes don't do more harm than good.
</P>

<P>This class will discuss the following techniques for maintaining
correctness under constant change are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>test suites and test suite applies</LI>
   
   <LI>coding for testing</LI>
</UL>
