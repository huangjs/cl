<p>All announcements for this course are done on 
<a href="news:cs.325">the EECS 325 Newsgroup</a>. With a decent
newsreader program, of which there are many, posting and reading
messages is orders of magnitude easier than using
the discussion forums provided by learning management systems
like Blackboard and WebCT.</p>

<p class="quote">Note: You must be on the Northwestern network
to read CS 325 news. If you're off-campus, use 
<a href="http://www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/vpn/">VPN</a> to connect
to Northwestern first.</p>

<p>To read the CS 325 newsgroup, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#reader">Get a newsreader</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#server">Define a <code>cs.news</code> account</a> in your newsreader, 
to read newsgroups on the 
CS news server.</li>
<li><a href="#subscribe">Subscribe to the CS 325 newsgroup</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#url">Make <code>news:cs.325</code> URL's start your newsreader</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="reader"></a>
<h2>Get a Newsreader</h2>

<p>The reason newsgroups work better than Blackboard discussion
forums is that newsreaders are programs optimized for reading
news, not clunky web pages. There's a zillion newsreaders,
including many free ones. I use 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> myself,
but Outlook Express also works fine, as does Mozilla and Netscape 7,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>You can find a list of newsreaders (for Windows but 
many work on Linux as well) at 
<a href="http://www.newsreaders.com/win/clients.html">
http://www.newsreaders.com/win/clients.html
</a>.</p>


<a name="server"></a>
<h2>Define a <tt>cs.news</tt> account</h2>

<p>Once you have a newsreader, you need to tell it where
to go to get the news. You can read news from many different servers. There's
a wealth of information on Usenet which has thousands
of newsgroups, read and posted to by people around the world.
Unfortunately, Northwestern no longer provides a server with
the Usenet groups, but you can see what's there using
<a href="http://groups.google.com">Google Groups</a>. If you'd like to join in, 
get a free account at 
<a href="http://www.individual.net/">news.individual.net</a>.</p>

<p>For this class, you need tell your newsreader
how to find and connect to the CS news server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Log onto the Northwestern virtual private network (VPN). Information
about this is <a href="http://www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/vpn/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Start your newsreader program.</li>
<li>Find the menu option for defining a new account. In Thunderbird,
this is under the <b>Tools</b> menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click the option for adding an account, your newsreader will
ask you for information about the news server and you. Here's what you 
need to tell it:</p>

<ul>
<li>News server name: <code>news.cs.northwestern.edu</code></li>
<li>Port: <code>119</code> -- this is the usual default</li>
<li>Authentication is <b>not</b> required.</li>
<li>Account name: use something short, e.g., <code>cs.news</code>.
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your email address</li>
<li>Your normal email server, e.g., the CS mail server
<code>mail.cs.northwestern.edu</code>, if you use that, or
the Northwestern mail server you use, e.g., <code>casbah.it.northwestern.edu</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, if you can find the option, be sure to <b>turn off</b>
using HTML in your messages. In Thunderbird, when you create the account,
this is checkbox under <code>Composition and Addressing</code>.</p>

<a name="subscribe"></a>
<h2>Subscribe to EECS 325 newsgroup</h2>

<p>Usually, when you first create or open the CS 325 account, 
your newsreader will
check the server to see what newsgroups are there. It will then
ask you something like "Do you want to review new newsgroups?"
Say "yes."</p>

<p>Newsgroups are organized into groups and subgroups, so 
the reader will usually display something like a directory tree.
For example, in Thunderbird, I see this:</p>

<img alt="closed subscription tree" src="../images/subscribe1.gif" />

<p>This says that there's one main group called <code>cs</code>. To see
the subgroups, I click the plus sign (<code>+</code>) and see this:</p>

<img alt="open subscription tree" src="../images/subscribe2.gif" />

<p>Now I just click on <code>cs.325</code> and click <b>Subscribe</b>
and <b>OK</b>. My newsreader will now download any messages I haven't seen
for easy reading and responding.</p>

<a name="url"></a>
<h2>Make <tt>news:cs.325</tt> start your newsreader</h2>

<p>This step is optional but it makes it easy to click on the
links in web pages that have the URL <code>news:cs.325</code> 
and go directly to your newsreader. For this to work, your browser has to 
know what your newsreader is. This is usually most easily done
in your newsreader. Look for an option to make the newsreader the
default for reading news. In Thunderbird, 
you'll find this checkbox in the dialog box that appears
when you select <b>Tools | Options</b>.</p>
