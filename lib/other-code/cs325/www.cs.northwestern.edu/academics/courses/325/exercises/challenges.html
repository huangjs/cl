<p>Challenges
are typically two or three times longer and/or more difficult than 
average exercises. They involve the application of multiple skills
and the ability to keep complex long code readable and maintainable.
Students who come to this course with no prior Lisp or Scheme
experience should do at least a few challenges. More
experienced programmers should focus on challenges over simpler
exercises.</p>

<h2><A NAME="make-best-change"></A>make-best-change</h3>

<P>Function name: <code>make-best-change</code></P>

<P>This is a variation on Graham's Exercise 9-2, which defines
a function 
<a href="graham-exs.html#make-change">make-change</a>. Do that
exercise first, and make sure you have 
an approved clean solution, before
doing this challenge.</p>

<p><code>make-change</code> 
may fail to find the best answer for certain sets of coins, where
best means "uses the fewest coins." For example,
if there are no nickels, then <code>(make-change 30 '(25 10 1))</code>
will return 1 quarter and 5 pennies, which is 6 coins, but 3 dimes would
be better.</p>

<p>Also, if the set of coins doesn't include pennies, then there may
not be an exact answer. The best
answer would be the one that comes closest, without going over the total
amount.</p>

<p>Define <code>make-best-change</code> to take 
the same arguments as <code>make-change</code>. <code>make-best-change</code> 
should return an answer that leaves the least amount of cents unaccounted for.
If there's more than such answer, it should return a solution that
uses the fewest coins.</p>

<P>Avoid excessive CONSing. In particular, your code should not generate a new 
list for each possible combination it tries, only for those that actually work. </P>


<h2><A NAME="intersect-segments"></A>intersect-segments</h3>

<P>Function name: <code>intersect-segments</code></P>
<P>This is Exercise 9-4 in Graham. It is a surprisingly tough problem, given
how simple it is to state. The solution will have a number of different
cases to check. A major part of the challenge is
organizing the code into short well-named modular subfunctions.</p>

<p>First, we need to clarify what <code>intersect-segments</code>
should do for several special cases:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>If the segments do not intersect, it should return nil.</li>
  
  <LI>If the segments are not parallel and intersect at one point,
  it should return 2 numbers, the x and y of the intersection point.</li>
   
  <LI>If the segments are parallel and overlap, then it should return
  4 numbers, the x and y of one endpoint of the overlap, 
  and the x and y of the other endpoint of the overlap.</li>
</UL>

<P>Parallel segments that meet at just an end point should return 4 numbers,
 x1, y1, x1, 
  y1, to distinguish that situation from the non-parallel case.</P>
  
<P>The other hard part of this problem is making the code maintainable. There 
  are a lot of special cases and a lot of repeated calculations. <em>Subfunctions 
  are a must</em>. My personal solution uses about a dozen functions!</P>
