<h2><a name="use">Using the Deductive Data Retriever</a></h2>


<P>Anyone should be able to work on the logic rule problems.
<em>Watch out for infinite loops!</em> But changing how the retriever works
should wait until you're feeling confident about programing very
recursive code.</p>

<p>These 
exercises require the following files
from the C25 library:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><a href="../programs/ddr.lisp">ddr.lisp</a> -- the code
   for <a href="../readings/ddr.html">the Deductive Data Retriever</a></li>

   <LI><a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a> --

   <li><a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a> -- the test cases for these exercises
</UL>

<P><a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>
and <a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a>
define all their tests in the package named <tt>ddr-tests</tt>. The easiest way
to work on these exercises is to write all your code in the
<tt>ddr-tests</tt> package, that is, create a file and
start the file with <tt>(in-package #:ddr-tests)</tt>.</p>

<p><i>Feel free to create new test cases!</i>.</P>



<h3><a name="member">Exercise: member</a></h3>

<p>Tests: <code>member</code> in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a></p>

<p>Define the predicate <code>(member <em>x l</em>)</code> to return
true if and only if <em>x</em> is a member of the list <em>l</em>,
where lists are represented using the same <code>(cons <em>x y</em>)</code>
functional terms used in the <code>append</code> example
in <a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a></p>


<h3><a name="all-different">Exercise: all-different</a></h3>

<p>Tests: <code>all-different</code> in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a></p>

<p>We rarely need an "is equal" predicate with a deductive retriever. For example,
if you want to say some binary relationship always holds for an object
with itself, just say <code>(relation ?x ?x)</code>, not <code>(<- (relation ?x ?y)
(equal ?x ?y))</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we do often need an "is different" predicate. For 
example, in the Monkey and Bananas code in <a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>,
we want to the monkey to go to the box only if 
the monkey's current location is different than the box's
location.</p>

<p>To make it easier to assert <code>(different x y)</code>,
the code in the Monkey and Bananas formulation
in <a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a> defines
a forward-chaining rule so that asserting <code>(different x y)</code>
automatically asserts <code>(different y x)</code>. (Why can't this
be a backward-chaining rule?)</p>

<p>That forward-chaining rule cuts the number of assertions needed in
half, but, if we have N objects, we still need to write order(N<sup>2</sup>)
assertions.</p>

<p>Define a forward-chaining rule for the predicate 
<code>(all-different <em>list</em>)</code>. <code>all-different</code>
takes a list represented
with the <code>(cons x y)</code> functional terms used in the predicates
<code>append</code> and <code>member</code>, and asserts that every
item in the list is different from every other item.</p>


<h3><a name="coloring">Exercise: Map Coloring</a></h3>

<p>Tests: <code>color-map1</code>, <code>color-map2</code>, and
<code>color-map3</code>in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a></p>

<p>The map coloring problem has a long history. The problem is simple: given a map
of various countries bordering each other, color the map using the fewest number
of colors, such that no countries sharing a border of more than a point
have the same color. For many years, it had been proven that 5 colors was sufficient for any
flat map, no matter how complex, and that no map was known that needed more than 4.
It finally required a computer to generate the complete proof that 4 was enough.</p>

<p>Here are three small maps, one already colored, the others left for you
to figure out:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="small-map.gif" alt="small map coloring problem">
</td><td>
<img src="medium-map.gif" alt="medium map coloring problem">
</td><td>
<img src="large-map.gif" alt="large map coloring problem">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><a href="http://mathforum.org/wagon/fall97/p840.html">Here</a>
is a more complicated map that Martin Gardner claimed required 5 colors.</p>

<p>You can encode a map coloring problem in logic with:</p>

<ul>
<li>some assertions about what different colors there are, and</li>

<li>rules (at least one per problem) for a predicate that says whether
some map coloring is legal for map; the rules
describe the coloring constraints that have to be satisfied.</li>
</ul>

<p>Define a KB with the colors red, blue, green and yellow.
Then define map coloring rules for the predicate 
<code>(colors-for <em>map a-region-color b-region-color c-region-color...</em>)</code>,
so that the test cases below pass.
Note that <code>colors-for</code> is given a different
number of arguments for each map. This is not a mistake nor
anything you have to treat specially.
You can have rules for all three maps at the same time. 
</p>

<p>Side question: The above maps all have 24 possible solutions.
Can you come up with a map that doesn't have 24 possible
solutions?</p>

<h3><a name="shakey-1">Exercise: Shakey 1.0</a></h3>

<p>Tests: <code>shakey-1</code> in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a></p>

<p>Shakey was one of <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/shakey/">the first intelligent robots in AI</a>.
Many people worked on many aspects of the system, from computer vision to motion, but
the part relevant here is <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/pubs/full.php?id=1104">Cordell Green's application of logic programming
to the planning problem</a>, details of which can be found in
<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/pubs/files/tn004-green69.pdf">"Application of Theorem Proving to Problem Solving."</a>
This paper does the Monkey and Bananas problem, Towers of Hanoi, and robot planning.</p>

<p>A common problem in early robotic planning was moving boxes from one room to
another, given information about box locations (current and desired),
room locations, doors being open or closed, etc. Several kinds
of information need to be represented:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unchanging facts, such as how rooms are connected: these
can be represented as static facts
in the knowledge base</li>

<li>Facts the robot can change, such as where it is: these
can be represented in a <em>state</em> structure, as with
Monkey and Bananas</li>

<li>The problem to be solved: this can be represented
by describing an initial state and a desired goal state
</ul>

<p>For this exercise, create a set of facts and rules to allow the
Retriever to solve simple Shakey problems. Follow the model of
the Monkey and Bananas example in
<a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>.</p>

<p>For Version 1.0, assume that Shakey only has to move 1 box from 1 room
to another, and there are no locked doors. The term for
representing a state is simply <code>(v1-state <em>robot-location</em>
<em>box-location</em>)</code>. 
There are just two
actions that change state:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(MOVE-TO <em>location</em>)</code>: the robot moves to a 
location, where a location can either be the hall or a room</li>

<li><code>(PUSH-BOX <em>location<sub>1</sub></em> <em>location<sub>2</sub></em>)</code>:
the robot pushes a box from one location to another.</li>
</ul>

<p>To keep things simple, ignore the subproblem of finding paths from
rooms to rooms. Instead, assume that all rooms are connected to the hall,
so the rules for moving and pushing boxes from
one room to another are simply:</p>

<ul>
<li>First move or push the box from the first room to the hall</li>

<li>Then move or push the box to the second room</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the same <code>PLAN-FOR</code> framework used in the 
Monkey and Bananas code in <a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>.
You should only need to define:</p>

<ul>
<li>rules for <code>RESULT</code> for what happens to states
when you move and push boxes</li>

<li>rules for <code>ACTION-FOR</code> for choosing an action, 
given a current state and a goal state</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>ACTION-FOR</code> rules are where you make the robot
smart enough to avoid getting into endless loops.</p>

<p>Tip: use <a href="#all-different">all-different</a> to quickly say
that room1, room2 and room3 are all different.</p>

<h3><a name="shakey-2">Exercise: Shakey 2.0</a></h3>

<p>Tests: <code>shakey-2</code> in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a></p>

<p><b>This is the hardest of the three Shakey exercises.</b>
When Shakey 1.0 is working, extend it to handle locked rooms.
The robot should be able to unlock a room from the hallway, but not
from inside the room. A robot can only enter or leave a room, when
moving or pushing a box, if it's unlocked.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is by extending the state to include
a list of the <b>unlocked</b> rooms. Make a new version of Shakey 1.0, 
where:</p>

<ul>
<li>the rules use the state form 
<code>(v2-state <em>robot-location box-location unlocked-room-list</em>)</code>
</li>

<li>the rules for selecting <code>MOVE-TO</code>
and <code>PUSH-BOX</code> require the rooms
involved to be unlocked
</li>

<li>rules are added for the action <code>UNLOCK</code>
which lets a robot in the hall unlock any room, i.e., add
it the list of unlocked rooms</li>
</ul>

<p>The test cases start with easy cases, where the room the robot
needs to enter, is in the unlocked list. The later cases
start with an empy list of unlocked
rooms.</p>

<p>Tip: use <a href="#member">member</a> to determine
if a room is unlocked, i.e., in the list of unlocked rooms.</p>


<h3><a name="shakey-3">Exercise: Shakey 3.0</a></h3>

<p>Tests: <code>shakey-3</code> in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-exs-tests.lisp">ddr-exs-tests.lisp</a></p>

<p>When Shakey 2.0 is working, extend it to handle multiple boxes.
We will assume that there's at most one box in a room, so
all we need to do is give a list of the rooms that have a box in them.
Shakey's goal is to move all such boxes into a destination room.
</p>

<p>There's not a lot of rules needed to do this.
Most of the work will still be done by the Shakey 2.0 rules. The trick is to create
a new state that contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>the robot's initial location</li>

<li>a list of the rooms with boxes to move, and</li>

<li>a list of the locked rooms, as with Shakey 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Capture this with the state form
<code>(v3-state <em>robot-location box-room-list unlocked-room-list</em>)</code>
</p>

<p>The robot is done when <em>box-room-list</em> is empty.
If the list isn't empty, the robot should</p>

<ul>
<li>find a plan for
the first box in the list, using your Shakey 2.0 rules,</li>

<li>find a plan for the remaining rooms</li>

<li>return the combined plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combine plans, use the rules for <code>APPEND</code>
defined in <a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>.</p>


<a name="improve"></a>

<h2>Improving the Deductive Data Retriever</h2>

<p>These exercises can make the Retriever less prone to infinite loops,
though they may also make it run a bit slower.</p>

<p>Do these as "patch files." That is, don't change the code
in <A HREF="../programs/ddr.lisp">ddr.lisp</A>, but create a new
file, e.g., <tt>ddr-patch.lisp</tt>. This file
should be in the <tt>ddr</tt> package and contain only the
new and changed definitions necessary to
change the Retriever. That way I can see your changes in one place and
test them, if necessary, by loading the original <tt>ddr.lisp</tt>
and your patches.</p>

<p>Make sure all the old tests in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>
continue to work as you modify the retriever, unless the
modification makes some test inappropriate.</p>

<p>The <A HREF="../admin/grading.html">email rules</A> still apply.
Use <A HREF="critic.html">the Lisp Critic</A> on your code before
sending.</P>


<a name="assert-file"></a>
<hr>
<h3>Exercise: <tt>assert-file</tt></h3>

<p>This one's easy, if you've done the I/O chapter.</p>

<p>Define <tt>(assert-file <em>pathname</em>)</tt> to assert
every fact and/or rule in the file named by <em>pathname</em>. It
should return a count of how many items were asserted.</p>

<p><a href="../programs/movies.lisp">movies.lisp</a> is a very large file of movie facts, adapted from
<a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMS30106/labs/labs0.html">a data file for a Prolog course</a>.
Test your code on that. It should say that it loaded 2909 items.
Make sure you've compiled
<a href="../programs/ddr.lisp">ddr.lisp</a>
before trying to load this file, otherwise Allegro may never finish!</p>


<a name="loop-catcher"></a>
<hr>
<h3>Exercise: DDR Loop Catcher</h3>

<p>It's easy to throw the Retriever into an endless loop, e.g.,</p>

<blockquote><pre>> (tell '(<- (married ?x ?y) (married ?y ?x)))

> (tell '(married john mary))

> (ask '(married mary john))</pre></blockquote>

<p>Some common loops can be caught by keeping a stack of current
goals, and, when adding to this stack, checking to see if the new
query matches (unifies) with a query on the stack already. If so,
then you're in trouble, and should quit the search with a failure.</p>

<p>Done correctly, the above example should return an answer
for both queries, but should return false for the query
<tt>(ask '(married brad angeline))</tt>.</p>

<a name="ask-1"></a>
<HR>
<H3>Exercise: DDR <tt>ask-1</tt></H3>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to make it possible to get
answers one at a time from the Deductive Retriever, somewhat
the way the Prolog interpreter works. It should be possible to get 
one answer and stop, and not pay the
cost of looking for other answers. This approach
has two advantages. First, if one answer is sufficient, you can get it
faster. Second, if a query has an infinite
number of answers, a particular
application can ask for the first N answers.</p>

<p>More specifically, you need to</p>

<ul>
<li>define a new function, <tt>ask-1</tt>, to get answers
one at a time, and</li>
<li>redefine <tt>ask</tt> to get all the answers
that <tt>ask-1</tt> can generate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new <tt>ask</tt> should
still pass all the tests in
<a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>.</p>

<p>The syntax of <tt>ask-1</tt> is like <tt>ask</tt>, 
i.e., <tt>(ask-1 <em>query [ form ]</em>)</tt>, except
that <em>query</em> is also optional. The semantics 
of <tt>ask-1</tt> is:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>(ask-1 <em>query form</em>)</tt>
returns the first of the answers, if any, that the original
<tt>(ask <em>query form</em>)</tt> would return.
</li>

<li>Subsequent calls with no arguments, i.e.,
<tt>(ask-1)</tt>, return the second, third, ... answers that
the original <tt>ask</tt> would return.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example of how <tt>ask-1</tt> should work with
one of the test knowledge bases in 
<a href="../programs/ddr-tests.lisp">ddr-tests.lisp</a>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>DDR-TESTS 16 > (make-tiger-kb)
...
DDR-TESTS 17 > (ask '(can-satisfy-hunger ?x))
((CAN-SATISFY-HUNGER ANTELOPE) (CAN-SATISFY-HUNGER TIGER))

DDR-TESTS 18 > (ask-1 '(can-satisfy-hunger ?x))
(CAN-SATISFY-HUNGER ANTELOPE)

DDR-TESTS 19 > (ask-1)
(CAN-SATISFY-HUNGER TIGER)

DDR-TESTS 20 > (ask-1)
NIL</pre></blockquote>

<p>As with <tt>ask</tt>, if <em>form</em> is omitted,
it should
default to <em>query</em>. If <tt>(ask-1)</tt> is
evaluated and no previous <em>query</em> has been specified,
<tt>(ask-1)</tt> should return false.</p>


<h4>Approach</h4>

<p>This problem has both a conceptual challenge
and a software programming challenge.
The conceptual challenge is how to represent the state of the deductive
search in a way that supports getting answers pne at a time. The
programming challenge is how to make as few changes as possible
to the existing tested Retriever code.

<p>The current code uses a simple uniform recursive logic: explore
all branches and 
append all results. This automatically takes care of branches that lead to
no results or many. But it means that the code has many functions 
calling other functions recursively, expecting to get lists of
all answers back. If now only one answer is returned, how can the basic
logic structure be kept?
</p>

<p>The answer is <em>generated lists</em>, also known as lazy lists and (in Abelson and Sussman's
<b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</b>) streams.
A generated list is a data structure with list-like operations, analogous to
<tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt>, but the elements of a generated list may
not exist until accessed. That is, the elements may be generate
on demand.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="../readings/list-gen.html">glist</a> package 
defines some basic functions that create and manipulate
generated lists. Most of these functions are analogous to the
standard list functions: <tt>gcar</tt>, <tt>gcdr</tt>, <tt>gappend</tt> and so on.
</p>

<p>Generated lists are not only a natural way to represent a list of solutions that
should be calculated only when requested. Because generated list functions look
like regular list functions, converting list code to generated list code is relatively
straightforward. Instead of consing or appending lists of all answers, you
<tt>gcons</tt> or <tt>gappend</tt> them. You need to do this both in
the main code
and some of the logic extensions, like <tt>match-and</tt>. Do
not, however, convert <em>all</em> lists to lazy lists. Many
lists in the Retriever code, e.g., lists of bindings should
remain normal lists. Only lists that require recursively finding alternatives
should be converted.</p>

<p>You'll need two top-level global variables where 
<tt>(ask-1 <em>query form</em>)</tt> can save information for subsequent calls:</p>

<ul>
<li>a variable to hold the <em>form</em> to instantiate on each answer</li>

<li>a variable to hold the initial generated list for <em>query</em></li>
</ul>

<p><tt>ask-1</tt> should set these variables when a new <em>query</em> and/or
<em>form</em> is passed in. <tt>ask-1</tt> should then pop off the next 
answer from the generated list. <tt>ask</tt> simply calls <tt>ask-1</tt>
repeatedly until it returns false, and collects all the answers.</p>
