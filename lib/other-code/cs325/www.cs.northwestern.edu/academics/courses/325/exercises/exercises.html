<p class="quote">NOTE 1: Always check your code with 
<A HREF="critic.html">Lisp Unit and the Lisp Critic</A> before submitting.
Even the project, where there are no Lisp Unit tests, can and should
be checked with the Critic. Unchecked code will be returned unreviewed.</P>

<P class="quote">NOTE 2: Type your function
definitions into a file editor window, not
the Lisp Listener window. Using the Listener window
produces badly indented code with tab
characters. (See <a href="http://xarg.net/writing/tabs">http://xarg.net/writing/tabs</a>
for why tab characters should never be in code.) You also lose your code
when you leave Lisp.</P>

<P>Exercises are like calisthenics. Everyone needs to do them, but at
their own pace and in their own order. They also help me get a
measure of what you know (see <A HREF="../admin/grading.html">the
rules on grading</A>).</P>

<P>These exercises are to give you practice in basic and advanced
Lisp programming, as well as AI programming.</P>

   Read this guide before sending anything from Graham! It says

   <LI><p><A HREF="challenges.html">Challenges</A>. Challenges
   are typically two or three times longer and/or more difficult than 
   average exercises. They involve the application of multiple skills
   and the ability to keep complex long code readable and maintainable.
   Students who come to this course with no prior Lisp or Scheme
   experience should do at least a few challenges. More
   experienced programmers should focus on challenges over simpler
   exercises.</p></LI>

   A few exercises writing rules in the deductive retriever, and
   some exercises modifying the deductive retriever code.</p></LI>
   
   <LI><p><a href="web-exs.html">AI Project Exercises</a>.  This set of 
   exercises develops over the quarter. 
   This year,  the project will involve web-based knowledge editing, pattern
   compiling, and semantic matching.</p></LI>

<P>Your goal for this course is to prove to me that you're a
good AI programmer. That means showing that you know how to apply
the major tools of Lisp to AI problems. The best way to do that is
to</P>

<UL>
<LI>Do some (but not all) exercises from every chapter of Graham 
that has exercises, and/or the Lisp
exercises, to show breadth of Lisp skills</LI>
<LI>Do as many of the Project exercises as you can
to show your AI skills</LI>
</UL>

<P>Don't put off <a href="web-exs.html">the Project exercises</a>! Mix them in with the 
book exercises as soon as you've done the first 5 basic chapters of Graham.</P>
