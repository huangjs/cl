<P>These exercises all involve use of the web, i.e.,
HTTP and/or HTML. They assume you have 
<a href="http://opensource.franz.com/aserve/">AllegroServe</a>
or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/">Portable AllegroServe</a>.</P>

<p>Different exercises emphasize different Lisp skills. Some exercises can be
done independently, others form a sequence.</p>

<h2>Exercise: File Updater</h2>

<p class="quote">Submit your entire code for this exercise as one submission. Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<P>A common problem with code libraries is keeping them
up to date. One solution is to have an update function 
that uses the web to check for and download new versions of 
files. Two examples of this are
<b>Windows Update</b> for Windows, and
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Web Start</a> for 
Java applications. In this exercise, you'll write a file updater for Lisp.</p>

<p>Define a function <span class="code-syntax">(update-file <em>file dir url</em>)</span> that 
compares <em>file</em> in the 
local directory <em>dir</em> against the version at <em>url</em>. 
If there is no such file in <em>dir</em>, 
or the file at <em>url</em> is newer, it should ask you if you want to 
download the version at <em>url</em>. 
If you say yes, it should copy the content of the 
version at <em>url</em> to the 
local directory <em>dir</em>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(update-file "exercise-tests.lisp"
   "c:/cs/cs325/code/"
   "http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/programs/")</pre></blockquote>
      
<p>will replace</p>

<blockquote><pre>c:/cs/cs325/code/exercise-tests.lisp</pre></blockquote>

<p>with the contents of</p>

<blockquote><pre>http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/programs/exercise-tests.lisp</pre></blockquote>

<p>if it is newer.</p>

<p>To do this, you need to learn how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make pathnames and URL's in a portable way</li>
<li>get a local file's last write date</li>
<li>get a URL's last modified date</li>
<li>parse and compare dates</li>
<li>write the contents of a URL to a file</li>
</ul>

<p>Graham doesn't have a chapter on Lisp's file functions, but they're all described 
briefly in the glossary, pp 371 - 379. Full details are in
Chapters 19 - 21 of 
<A HREF="http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html">the Common
Lisp HyperSpec&#153;</A>.</p>

<p>To get both the contents of a URL and information about the file that
contains that content, use 
AllegroServe's <code>do-http-request</code> function.</p>

<p>You can get modification
information <em>without</em> getting the entire file first, 
using the HTTP <code>head</code>
method instead of the default <code>get</code>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(net.aserve.client:do-http-request <em>url</em> :method :head)</pre></blockquote>

<p>See <a href="http://opensource.franz.com/aserve/">the AServe documentation</a>
and play with some examples in the Listener.</p>

<p>To parse the date-time string you get from the web server, 
don't reinvent the wheel and write your own parser. Use the date-time parser in
<tt>date.lisp</tt> in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clocc">the CLOCC Library</a>.
(This is the library that has the XML parser we use.) 
Look at the functions exported by that file, and read the comments,
to find a function that parses dates and times.</p>

<p>There are usually two ways that dates are represented in 
in programming language:</p>

<ul>
<li>As an integer, representing the date and time as so many seconds or
milliseconds from some standard base date</li>
<li>As a data structure with fields for day, month, year, hours, minutes
and second.</li>
</ul>

<p>The integer format is the simplest to use for comparing two date-times,
or for calculating the difference between two date-times. Details
on the standard representations of time in Common Lisp are in
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/25_ad.htm">the Hyperspec</a>.</p>

<p>Test the function or functions you think you want to use from
<tt>date.lisp</tt> in a listener window, using the
date-time strings returned by the HTTP <code>head</code> method.
Make sure the function you pick does what you want.</p>

<h2>Exercise: Path Handlers</h2>

<p class="quote">Submit your entire code for this exercise as one submission. 
Include both <tt>define-path-handler</tt> and <tt>test-path-handler</tt>. Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<p>When defining and publishing a function
to respond to a URL, many of the same tasks occur over and over. For example,
below is code for a web form that calls the Lisp Critic. I've 
underlined patterns of code that are commonly repeated:</p>

<blockquote><pre><u>(publish :path "/critic" :function 'critique-code)</u>

(defun critique-code (req ent)    
  <u>(with-http-response (req ent)</u>
    <u>(with-http-body (req ent)</u>
      (make-critique-page <u>(request-query-value "code" req)</u>))))

(defun make-critique-page (text)
  (html 
   (:html
    ...
      ((:textarea :name "code" :rows 5 :cols 60)
        <u>(unless (null text) (html (:princ text))</u>))))
    ...
      <u>(unless (null text)</u>
        (html (:pre (:princ-safe (critique-code-string text)))))))
   )))

(defun critique-code-string (s)
  <u>(let ((*read-eval* nil))</u>
    ...
    (critique-definition <u>(read-from-string s)</u>))
    ...))</pre></blockquote>

<p>While none of this is all that complex, it is tedious,
and, in some cases, easy to get wrong, e.g., forgetting to
set <code>*read-eval*</code> to <code>nil</code>, or forgetting
to check for a request parameter value being null, before printing,
or an empty string, before reading.</p>

<p>On top of all this, you have to remember to define
subfunctions, such as <code>make-critique-page</code>, so that you can test
your code outside the context of responding to HTTP requests.
You need an extra function because an AllegroServe request
handler function needs a request and a response entity. 
To test a request handler, you would need to create
both kinds of objects, and these normally are created only by a 
web server responding to a web client.</p>

<p class="quote">What follows is one of many similar approaches for making
web pages more testable and easier to define. Like all designs, it has
strengths and weaknesses. If you think you have a better macro design, submit
some examples of using the macro for approval. Once approved, implement
your idea.</p>

<p>A better way is to define</p>

<ul>
<li>a macro <code>define-path-handler</code> for defining web page code
more simply</li>

<li>a function <code>test-path-handler</code> for testing web page code
without needing to run the web server</li>

</ul>

<p>I use the term <em>path handler</em> to distinguish these from AllegroServe's 
request handler functions that require request and response entities.</p>

<p>Here's an example use to <code>define-path-handler</code>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(define-path-handler "/critic" (code)
  (html 
   (:html
    ...
      ((:textarea :name "code" :rows 5 :cols 60)
        <u>(when (text) (html (:princ (text :string))))</u>))))
    ...
      <u>(when (text)</u>
        (html (:pre (:princ-safe (critique-code-string <u>(text :string)</u>)))))))
   )))</pre></blockquote>
   
<p>In general, <code>define-path-handler</code> takes</p>

<ul>
<li>a path, the same as is given to <code>publish</code></li>

<li>a list of zero or more <em>parameter accessors</em>,
described below</li>

<li>a body, i.e., a list of one or
more expressions.</em>
</ul>

<p><code>define-path-handler</code> expands into code that 
calls <code>publish</code> with 
the given path, e.g., <code>/critic</code>, and the body, wrapped inside
the standard <code>(with-http-response ... (with-http-body ...))</code>
forms.
</p>

<p>In addition, the handler is stored so that it can be
easily tested with <code>test-path-handler</code>.
<code>test-path-handler</code></p>

<ul>
<li>takes a path and an a-list</li>

<li>passes the a-list to the handler associated with the path</li>

<li>returns a string containing all output sent by
the handler to <code>*HTML-STREAM*</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, we could test our Lisp Critic with:</p>

<blockquote><pre>> (test-path-handler "/critic"
    '(("code" . "(defun foo (x) (setq x (+ x 1)))")))
    
"&lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;title>Lisp Critic&lt;/title>..."
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Inside the body of a path handler, the parameter accessors
listed, e.g., <code>code</code>, are bound to <b>locally defined
functions</b> that scan the association list returned
by <code>request-query</code> for entries whose
key, i.e., <code>CAR</code>,
is <code>STRING-EQUAL</code> to the symbol's name.</p>

<p>Parameter accessor functions take one argument, a keyword, for
specifying in what form you want the parameter value:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(<em>accessor</em> :string)</code> returns the first
non-empty string value, or the empty string if there is none</li>

<li><code>(<em>accessor</em> :strings)</code> returns a list of the non-empty string values for all
matching entries</li>

<li><code>(<em>accessor</em> :value)</code> returns the result of <em>safely reading</em>
one value from the first non-empty string value</li>

<li><code>(<em>accessor</em> :values)</code> returns a list of the results of <em>safely reading</em>
all values from the non-empty string values for all matching entries</li>
</ul>

<p>The term <em>safely reading</em> means that</p>

<ul>
<li>null is returned, not an error, in the case of null and empty string values</li>

<li>values are read from
strings with <code>*READ-EVAL*</code> set to <code>NIL</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise Name: Lisp XML-RPC Services</h2>

<p class="quote">Submit your entire code for this exercise as one submission. 
Include the test XML-RPC calls and results for both your Lisp client
and whatever other client you used. Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<p>Set up at least 3 potentially useful Lisp-based XML-RPC services, using 
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml-rpc/">the S-XML-RPC library</a>.
Do this only after you've read <a href="../readings/xml-rpc.html">my notes on S-XML-RPC</a> and have
installed and tested that library.</p>

<h3>Number Formatting Service</h3>

<p>Lisp is unusual in providing, through <code>FORMAT</code>
directives, the ability to format integers in 

<ul>
<li><strong>binary</strong>, e.g., 1574 as "110 0010 0110"</li>

<li><strong>Roman numerals</strong>, e.g., 1574 as "MDLXXIV"</li>

<li><strong>old style Roman numerals</strong>, e.g., 1574 as "MDLXXIIII"</li>

<li><strong>English cardinals</strong>, e.g., 1547 
as "one thousand five hundred and seventy-four"</li>

<li><strong>English ordinals</strong>, e.g., 1547 
as "one thousand five hundred and seventy-fourth"</li>
</ul>

<p>Define an XML-RPC method <code>lisp.formatNumber</code> that takes two arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>a format style, either <tt>"binary"</tt>, <tt>"roman"</tt>, <tt>"old-roman"</tt>, <tt>"cardinal"</tt>, or
<tt>"ordinal"</tt></li>

<li>an integer</li>
</ul>

<p>and returns a string formatted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Lisp Critic</h3>

<p>Define an XML-RPC method <code>critic.critique</code> that takes one argument,
a string containing Lisp code, e.g., <tt>"(defun foo (x) (setq x (+ x 1)))"</tt>,
and returns a string (possibly empty) of Lisp critiques, as returned
by the Lisp Critic.</p>

<h3>A Service of Your Design</h3>

<p>Define an XML-RPC method of your choice. Like the above examples,
a good XML-RPC service is one that:</p>

<ul>
<li>involves modest amounts of data traffic</li>

<li>requires modest computational requirements on the server</li>

<li>would not be easily doable on the client without additional software</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementing XML-RPC Methods</h3>

<p>Implementing a service is relatively simple. You just need to define
a function in the <code>s-xml-rpc-exports</code> package, like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(defun s-xml-rpc-exports::|lisp.formatNumber| (...)
 ...)</pre></blockquote>
 
<p>The vertical bars force Lisp to preserve the camelcase function name,
because that's the way XML-RPC methods are commonly named. Other than naming,
an XML-RPC method is a normal Lisp function. The parameters
should be kept simple, i.e., numbers, strings, and simple lists
and structures, because of that's what the XML-RPC protocol allows.
Similarly, the function should return either a number, string,
simple list, or structure.</p>

<p>"Structure" here means an XML-RPC structure,
which is a list of name-value pairs. In S-XML-RPC client code
in Lisp, you create an XML-RPC structure with
<code class="code-syntax">(s-xml-rpc:xml-rpc-struct <em>key value key value ...</em>)</code>.
In XML-RPC server code in Lisp, you get at parts of an XML-RPC
structure with 
<code class="code-syntax">(s-xml-rpc:get-xml-rpc-struct-member <em>struct key</em>)</code>.

<h3>Testing XML-RPC Methods</h3>

<p>Test this code by starting the server, using</p>

<blockquote><pre>(setq *xml-server* (start-xml-rpc-server :port 8080))</pre></blockquote>

<p>We store the name of the server in <code>*xml-server*</code> so
that we can easily stop it later.</p>

<p>Then call your three XML-RPC methods, with different arguments, <em>with
at least two different clients</em>. One client should be Lisp, e.g.,</p>

<blockquote><pre>> (xml-rpc-call (encode-xml-rpc-call "lisp.formatNumber" "roman" 1574) :port 8080)
"MDLXXIV"</pre></blockquote>

<p class="quote">If no <tt>:host</tt> argument is given, <tt>XML-RPC-CALL</tt>
assumes <tt>localhost</tt>.</p>

<p>The other client can be anything you want, e.g., Perl, Python, C++, Java, etc.
A number of examples in various languages is given at 
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XML-RPC-HOWTO/">the XML-RPC How To site</a>,
and there is also
<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/implementations">a long list of implementations of XML-RPC</a>.
</p>

<p>If you want to use Python or
Java, see <a href="../readings/xml-rpc.html#testing-xml-rpc">my XML RPC testing notes</a>. In that
case, an example Java call to test the format code might be:</p>

<blockquote><pre><span class="input">java -jar xml-rpc-test.jar http://localhost:8080/RPC2 lisp.formatNumber roman 1574</span>
MDLXXIV</pre></blockquote>

<p>When you're done, for safety, be sure to stop the XML-RPC server, with</p>

<blockquote><pre>(stop-server *xml-server*)</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Exercise Name: Rule Browser</h2>

<p class="quote">Submit your entire code for this exercise as one submission. Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<p>Fairly simple <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/">HTML</a>
and <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">CSS</a>
can be used to make a very nice web-based interface for browsing knowledge bases.
For example, here's a browsing interface I've built for the Lisp Critic's
rule base:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../images/critic-browse1.gif" alt="critic browser v1" />
</p>

<p class="quote">This and other screen shots 
are to clarify what needs to be built. Feel free to do something 
you think it would be better. If, however,
you have a drastically different interface design in mind, 
<b>get it approved first</b> by submitting a description
of it, with a Subject line such as <tt>Proposed Rule Editor Interface</tt>.
</p>

<p>Using AServe and 
<a href="http://opensource.franz.com/aserve/aserve-dist/doc/htmlgen.html">the HTML generator macro</a>, 
create a dynamic web page
that displays the names and response format strings for all of
the critiquing rules in the Lisp Critic, similar to the output shown
in the example image. Use the function <code>get-pattern-names</code>
in the Lisp Critic package to get the set of Lisp rule names. 
</p>


<a name="editor"></a>

<h2>Exercise Name: Rule Editor</h2>

<p class="quote">Submit your entire code for this exercise as one submission. Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a web-based editor
for creating and modifying the rules in the Lisp Critic.
This would allow users to edit the knowledge base at 
any time from any place. We'd probably want 
some form of login to control who can do this, but we
won't do that in these exercises.
</p>

<p>A good way to design real software is to start
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use cases</a>.
Even simple systems will usually have at least
half a dozen use cases. We'll pick just one here:</p>

<div class="use-case">
<h4>Lisp Critic Rule Editor Use Case: Edit a Rule</h4>

<ul>
<li>The user begins editing by selecting a rule from
a list of rules displayed by the system.</li>

<li>The system displays the rule in a simple form, including
the rule's pattern, message string, and test cases.</li>

<li>The user modifies one or more fields of the form.
In response, the system shows how the rule performs on the test cases.
</li>

<li>The user tells the system to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>A use case describes <strong>functionality</strong>
not interface or implementation. There are many ways
to implement the above use case. I have built my
own solution to this problem. To do the first step,
where users select a rule to edit, I made a small change to 
<a href="#browser">the Rule Browser</a> so that the rule
names became links that, when clicked on, opened a
Rule Editor page with that rule's data. The new
Rule Browser page looks like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="Rule Browser V2)" src="../images/critic-browse2.gif">
</p>

<p>Clicking on any rule name takes you to a page for editing
that rule that looks like this:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="Rule Browser V2)" src="../images/critic-edit1.gif">
</p>

<p>The user can change the text in one or more fields of the form.
When the user clicks <span class="button">Save</span>, the rule
in memory is updated with the modified fields. (I used   
the <code>add-lisp-pattern</code>
function in the <code>lisp-critic</code> package. Note that if the
user changes the name, then I also have to remove the old rule,
using <code>remove-lisp-pattern</code>.)</p>

<p>The user can test her changes, <em>after saving the changes</em>, by
clicking the
<span class="button">Run Lisp Critic</span> button to go
to the Lisp Critic web page (as defined by 
<a href="../programs/test-aserve.lisp">test-aserve.lisp</a>), 
and trying some examples. (The next exercise is about
a much better way to test changes.)</p>

<p>Note: making rule names into links is not very hard. For example,
in my sample solution, here's the HTML my Lisp code generates
for the <code>CAR-CDR</code> table entry:</p>

<blockquote><pre>&lt;tr>
&lt;th>&lt;a href="/critic/edit?rule=CAR-CDR">CAR-CDR&lt;/a>&lt;/th>
&lt;td>Use CADR ...&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr></pre></blockquote>

<p>I use AServe to map the URL <tt>/critic/edit</tt> to a Lisp function that generates
the rule editing page, and that page uses the value of the <code>rule</code>
request parameter to determine what rule to show.</p>

<a name="parameters"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Exercise: <tt>with-request-parameters</tt></h2>

<p class="quote">Submit your code for
<tt>with-request-parameters</tt> as one submission. Include
at least one example of real usage of this macro. One good place
to use this macro is when
defining your <a href="#editor">Rule Editor</a> function.
Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<p>While it's easy to get a single request parameter
with <code>request-query-value</code> and put it in a local variable,
things quickly become tedious if you have to get four or five such values, 
and convert all or most of the string values 
to Lisp numbers, symbols or lists.
</p>

<p>This is where a macro can make code much more readable and
maintainable. There are many possible macro designs. The one given here
is fairly simple yet flexible. Define</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code-syntax">
(with-request-parameters (<em>var-spec</em><sub>1</sub> <em>var-spec</em><sub>2</sub> ...)
     <em>request</em>
  <em>exp</em><sub>1</sub> 
  <em>exp</em><sub>2</sub> 
  ...)  
</pre></blockquote>

<p>to expand into code that evaluates the expressions, with local variables
bound to values from <em>request</em>, as specified by the 
<em>var-spec</em>'s. A <em>var-spec</em> can be either a 
list of the form <span class="code-syntax">(<em>
name function</em> [ <em>default-value</em> ])</span>, or a simple
name, which is equivalent to the list 
<span class="code-syntax">(<em>name</em> safe-read)</span>.
</p>

<a name="tester"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Exercise: Rule Tester</h2>

<p class="quote">Submit all your <b>new</b> code for this exercise as one submission. Put your
test cases first, followed by the code you added or changed to run
the test cases. Don't send code that was unchanged, or modified in
only minor ways. Run the
Lisp Critic on your code before sending.</p>

<p>Manually testing changes to rules using the Lisp Critic
is both tedious and unlikely to be very complete. A much better way is
to maintain a database of examples for each rule and re-test
the rule against that database whenever the rule is changed.
</p>

<p>With any kind of pattern-based rules, we need two kinds
of examples: <b>positive</b> cases that the rules should match, and 
<b>negative</b> cases that
the rules should not match.</p>

<p>For this exercise, create a small file with 
positive and negative test cases for
two or three rules, represented in some simple form of your
design. Load this file into your Lisp.</p>

<p>Define a function 
<span class="code-syntax">(rule-ok-p <em>name</em>)</span>
that returns true if and only if the rule named 
matches all its positive test cases, and none of its
negative test cases. Use <code>apply-critique-rule</code>
in the Lisp Critic package to see if a rule 
matches a piece of code.</p>

<p>Change the <a href="#editor">Rule Editor</a> page to display all the test cases
in a readable way, with all the rules that fail clearly marked.
This will make it easy for a user to see which cases are and are
not working.</p>

<p>
Change the <a href="#browser">Rule Browser</a> page to similarly mark all rules
that fail one or more of their test cases. This will make it
easy for a user to see which rules have problems.</p>

<p>In my sample solution, I created several test cases for
the <code>CAR-CDR</code> rule, including one positive case that it does not
currently catch. Here's how I did show the test case results on my 
Rule Editor page:</p>

<a name="edit2"></a>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="Rule Browser V2)" src="../images/critic-edit2.gif">
</p>

<p>Here's how I changed my Rule Browser to show that <code>CAR-CDR</code>
is not passing all its test cases:</p>

<p>Add a page for editing test cases. This means displaying the existing

<p class="quote">Submit all your <b>new</b> code for this exercise as one submission. 
Don't send code that was unchanged, or modified in

<p>Right now, all of the changes your editor makes are 
only changes to the rules and test cases in memory. When
you exit your Lisp code, all your changes are lost.
To make the changes permanent, the changes need to be
saved to a file.</p>

<p>Add a <span class="button">Make Changes Permanent</span>
button to both the Rule Browser and Rule Editor. Clicking this
button should cause your Lisp code to write both the rules
and the test cases out to whatever file they were loaded from.
The rules should be written in one file, 
using <code>define-lisp-pattern</code>
forms. The test cases should be written in a separate file,
using whatever Lisp form you feel is appropriate.

<p>This is an "exercise-in-progress." The basic idea is to 
define a function that can convert 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL</a> ontologies, such as the
ones available at
<a href="http://www.schemaweb.info/">SchemaWeb</a>,
into machine-usable knowledge.</p>

<p>Specifically, define a function <code>(read-kb-from-url <em>url</em>)</code>
to return a list of assertions suitable for feeding to the 
<code>init-kb</code> function in the <a href="../readings/ddr.html">Deductive Retriever</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Ontologies are mostly about class relationships
and class restrictions on predicates, e.g., that the actor of
a "tell" has to be some kind of intelligent agent.
These relationships can be captured and used in the 
Deductive Retriever as backchaining rules. For example, to say that
tree is a subclass of plant, we make tree and plant predicates, and say
</p>

<blockquote><pre>(tell '(&lt;- (plant ?x) (tree ?x))</pre></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, if we wanted to say that buyers are humans,</p>

<blockquote><pre>(tell '(&lt;- (human ?x) (buy ?x ?y))</pre></blockquote>

<p>From these rules, if the system hears about someone buying a tree, it can
infer that a human bought a plant.</p>

<p>Here's an example of possible output in this form for one simple
OWL ontology at SchemaWeb:</p>

<blockquote><pre>> (pprint (read-kb-from-url "http://pervasive.semanticweb.org/ont/2004/01/agent"))

<em>... harmless warnings about entities being redefined ...</em>

((&lt;- (AGENT ?X) (DESIRES ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (STATE-CONDITION ?Y) (DESIRES ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (AGENT ?X) (INTENDS ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (ACTION ?Y) (INTENDS ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (AGENT ?X) (BELIEVES ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (FACT ?Y) (BELIEVES ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (ACTION ?X) (OBJECT ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (TARGET-OBJECT ?Y) (OBJECT ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (ACTION ?X) (EFFECT ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (ACTION-EFFECT ?Y) (EFFECT ?X ?Y))
 (&lt;- (STATEMENT ?X) (FACT ?X)))</pre></blockquote>
 
<p>Make your code modular. Most of your functions should be very short
and well-named and re-usable. The one annoyingly messy part
is converting RDF strings into readable Lisp symbols, e.g., 
<tt>"ActionEffect"</tt> into <tt>action-effect</tt>,
<tt>"#Agent"</tt> into <tt>agent</tt>, and 
<tt>"&amp;rdfs;fact"</tt> into <tt>fact</tt>. One way to do
this is to adapt Graham's buffer reading code, but that's not very pretty
code.</p>

<p>Use <tt>net.aserve.client:do-http-request</tt> 
from <a href="../admin/current-quarter/assignment3.html">Assignment 3</a> to access the URL,
and the CLOCC XML parser from 
<a href="../admin/current-quarter/assignment4.html">Assignment 4</a> to parse the XML.</tt>
</p>

<p>Final warning: start simple. The agent ontology is pretty small
and doesn't do any complicated. But full OWL (even OWL Lite) can 
have all kinds of nested relationships.</p>
