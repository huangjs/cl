This archive contains an initial set of files that you'll need
for CS 325. This archive is for Allegro CL 6.0 on Windows
and MCL 4.2 on Macintosh OS 7 through 9.

To get the free trial version of Allegro CL 6.0, 
follow the instructions at http://www.franz.com

To get the free trial version of Macintosh CL 4.2,
follow the instructions as http:.//www.digitool.com

Create a directory for your Lisp files for this course. I'll
assume here you've made a top-level folder called CS325.


Files
-----

Windows: startup.cl
Macintosh: init.lsp

Read the instructions at the front of startup.cl or
init.lsp. The instructions tell you how to modify that
file and where to put the customized version.

*.lisp
*.txt
*.rules
*.fasl
...

Put all the other files in your CS 325 directory.

All of these are text files except the .fasl files,
which are compiled versions of Lisp files. Compiled
code loads and runs much faster than Lisp source files.
