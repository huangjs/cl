<div id="banner">The Cardinal Rule of Functions</div>

<p>Functions should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>short</li>

<li>easy to understand</li>

<li>well-named</li>

<li>reusable</li>

<li>maintainable</li>
</ul>

<p>All these desirable properties follow from obeying the
<strong>Cardinal Rule of Functions</strong>.</p>

<table align="center" bgcolor="yellow" border="1">
<tr>
<th>One Function to a Function</th>
</tr>
</table>

<p>That is, the code implementing a function should have one and
only one task to do. Example tasks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Combine: apply several other functions to a set of
arguments</li>

<li>Dispatch: decide which of several other functions to apply to
a set of arguments</li>

<li>Iterate: repeatedly apply another function to a list of
argument values</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that these tasks correspond to classic control
structures (composition of function calls, conditional branching,
and iteration). A symptom that the rule has been broken is when
several of these control structures appear in one function.
Another symptom is when you have trouble keeping a function to
less than a dozen lines of code, and/or its lines to less than 72
characters.</p>

<p>Another good sign that the rule has been broken is difficulty
naming the function clearly, or using names like
<code>scan-and-compress-and-print</code>.</p>
