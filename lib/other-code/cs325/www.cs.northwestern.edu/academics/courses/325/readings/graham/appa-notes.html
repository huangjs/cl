<H4>backtraces</H4>

<P>Backtraces are incredibly useful for debugging. Be aware though
that tail-call elimination may have removed some function calls from
the stack.</P>

<H4>unbound variables</H4>

<P>Make sure you read the error messages carefully. </P>

<UL>
   <LI><U>Unbound variable</U> means Lisp thinks the symbol is being
   used as a variable.
   
   <LI><U>Undefined function</U> means Lisp thinks the symbol is
   being used as a function.
</UL>

<P>Often, you'll see a symbol that you <I>know</I> is defined in an
error message. Perhaps though, due to incorrect parenthesization, a
function is being used as a variable or vice versa:</P>

<PRE>? (cond (zerop x) (print 'ok)
Error: unbound variable ZEROP
&nbsp;
? (let ((x 1) (y 2)) (print (x y)))
Error: undefined function X</PRE>
