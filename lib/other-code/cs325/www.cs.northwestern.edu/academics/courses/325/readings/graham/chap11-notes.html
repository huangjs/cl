<H4><TT>:initform</TT></H4>

<P>There are actually two ways to initialize slots in CLOS,
<U>initforms</U> and <U>default initargs</U>. The latter are more
commonly used. </P>

<P>Here's how default initargs are used when defining
<CODE>circle</CODE>:</P>

<PRE>(defclass circle ()
  ((radius :accessor circle-radius :initarg :radius)
   (center :accessor circle-center :initarg :center))
  (:default-initargs
    :radius 1
    :center (cons 0 0)))</PRE>

<P>What's the difference between default initarg's and initforms? A
default initarg is a default value for an initarg. An initform is a
default value for a slot. </P>

<P>So what difference does that make? Here's how it works. When you
say</P>

<PRE>(make-instance 'circle ...)</PRE>

<P><CODE>make-instance</CODE> (in conjunction with
<CODE>initialize-instance</CODE>) creates an instance of a circle as
follows:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><CODE>make-instance</CODE> creates an empty instance. 
   
   <LI><CODE>make-instance</CODE> passes the instance and the other
   arguments to <CODE>initialize-instance</CODE>. 
   
   <LI><CODE>initialize-instance</CODE> first uses any explicit
   initargs that you gave to <CODE>make-instance</CODE>.
   
   <LI>For slots still unitialized, it then uses any default initargs
   that have been defined.
   
   <LI>Finally, for slots still unitialized, it uses any default
   initforms that have been defined.
</UL>

<P>So one difference is that default initargs take priority over
initforms.</P>

<P>Here's another difference. Suppose we add an area slot to circle:
</P>

<PRE>(defclass circle ()
  ((radius :accessor circle-radius :initarg :radius)
   (center :accessor circle-center :initarg :center)
   (area :accessor circle-area))
  (:default-initargs
    :radius 1
    :center (cons 0 0)))</PRE>

<P>Note that there is neither an initform nor an initarg for
<CODE>area</CODE>. Instead, we are going to calculate the area from
the radius when the instance is created. Suppose we do this by
defining an after method on <CODE>initialize-instance</CODE>:</P>

<PRE>(defmethod initialize-instance :after 
           ((c circle) &amp;key radius &amp;allow-other-keys)
  (setf (circle-area c) (* pi radius radius)))</PRE>

<P>Now suppose we make the following call:</P>

<PRE>(make-instance 'circle)</PRE>

<P>This works fine with our definition of <CODE>circle</CODE>. But if
we replaced the default initargs with initforms, it would cause an
error, because <CODE>radius</CODE> would be <CODE>nil</CODE>. No
<CODE>:radius</CODE> argument was given and there was no default
value for that argument.</P>

<P>Note that we could define the after method on
<CODE>initialize-instance</CODE> to work with either class definition
as follows:</P>

<PRE>(defmethod initialize-instance :after 
           ((c circle) &amp;rest args)
  (setf (circle-area c) 
        (* pi (circle-radius c) (circle-radius c))))</PRE>

<P>This definition has two disadvantages:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>It's slightly more costly to access a slot than a keyword
   value.
   
   <LI>It doesn't generalize to before methods, where the slots
   haven't been created yet.
</UL>

<P>For this reason, many programmers use default initargs in their
class definitions, rather than initforms.</P>

<H3>Page 190</H3>

<H4><TT>(defclass suit (jacket trousers) ())</TT></H4>

<P><strong>Wrong, wrong, wrong!</strong> A suit is not a subtype of jacket or
trousers. A suit consists of a jacket and trousers. </P>

<P>Don't use "is a" when you mean "has a." This is a classic mistake
made by people in all object oriented programming environments.</P>

<P>One reasonable way to do this example is:</P>

<PRE>(defclass suit ()
  ((jacket :accessor suit-jacket :initarg :jacket)
   (trousers :accessor suit-trousers :initarg :trousers)))
&nbsp;
(defmethod price ((jk jacket)) 350)
(defmethod price ((tr trousers)) 200)
&nbsp;
(defmethod price ((s suit)) 
  (+ (price (suit-jacket s)) (price (suit-trousers s))))</PRE>

<P>So, what is a good example requiring non-standard method
combinations? Good question. I've not needed them so
far.</P>
