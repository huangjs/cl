<P>The comment that <CODE>not</CODE> and <CODE>null</CODE> do exactly
the same thing is correct but this does not make the two functions
interchangable.</P>

<P>Use <CODE>not</CODE> on values that are conceptually true or
false, i.e., calls to predicate such as <CODE>atom</CODE> or
<CODE>some</CODE>, or variables that hold flag values.</P>

<P>Use <CODE>null</CODE> on variables and function calls that contain
or return lists. (Actually, in many cases you should use
<CODE>endp</CODE>.)</P>

<P>Some examples:</P>

      </TD><TD>
         <P>tests a predicate for emptiness
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>Final note: even though <CODE>(not (null l))</CODE> is technically
equivalent to just <CODE>l</CODE>, use the former not the latter, if
<CODE>l</CODE> is a variable containing a list, as its name implies.
</P>

<H3>Page 16</H3>

<P>The definition of <CODE>our-member</CODE> is a good example of
Graham's preference for <CODE>if</CODE> over
<CODE>cond</CODE>. The <CODE>cond</CODE> version is more standard
Common Lisp, because it avoids the nested conditional:</P>

<PRE>(defun our-member (obj lst)
  (cond ((null lst) nil)
        ((eql obj (car lst)) lst)
        (t (our-member obj (cdr lst)))))
&nbsp;</PRE>

<H3>Page 24</H3>

<P><CODE>show-squares</CODE> is another example where
<CODE>cond</CODE> is more appropriate. In this case, it avoids the
need for a nested <CODE>progn</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>(defun show-squares (i end)
  (cond ((&gt; i end) 'done)
        (t (format t "~A ~A~%" i (* i i))
           (show-squares (+ i 1) end))))
&nbsp;</PRE>

<H3>Page 37</H3>

<P><CODE>compr</CODE> and <CODE>n-elts</CODE> are both terrible
function names. The former suggests nothing at all, except a
confusing similarity to <CODE>compress</CODE>, and the latter
suggests that it generates a list of N elements, not a pair of the
form <CODE>(</CODE><EM><CODE>number
element</CODE></EM><CODE>)</CODE>.</P>

<P>Names like <CODE>compr</CODE>, <CODE>compress2</CODE>,
<CODE>recursive-compress</CODE> are typical names that programmers
generate when at a loss for how to name a function. They're all
terrible.</P>

<P>Here's an important rule for names:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Never name a function by its relationship to another
function. Always name a function by the task it does.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you follow the <A HREF="../cardinal-rule.html">Cardinal Rule of
Functions</A>, then generating a good name should not be hard. Just
name it for the single task that it does.</P>

<P>If two functions do similar tasks, they usually differ by the kind
of arguments they take, e.g., <CODE>compress-list</CODE> versus
<CODE>compress-string</CODE>. If they do the same thing to the same
arguments, then why are there two functions?</P>

<P>In this particular case, <CODE>compr</CODE>'s primary task is
<EM>not</EM> "compress a list." It's "given an object and a list,
collect a run for the given object." The run collected is returned in
the form of a pair of the form <CODE>(</CODE><EM><CODE>length
object</CODE></EM><CODE>)</CODE>.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, <CODE>compr</CODE> has a secondary task, which is
to recursively repeat this process with the remainder of the list.
This is a common problem with recursive code. It mixes control
structure with tasks and that makes it harder to name. The best we
can do is probably something like <CODE>scan-and-compress</CODE>.
</P>

<P>Or we could do <A HREF="generators.html">generators.html</A> .
</P>


<H3>Page 38</H3>

<P><CODE>list-of</CODE> is unnecessary. Common Lisp already has a
function <CODE>make-list</CODE> that does the same thing.</P>

<P>This is fortunate because there's a much more interesting use for
the name <CODE>list-of</CODE> in the macro exercises.</P>

<H3>Page 39</H3>

<P>In this class, we'll use <CODE>require</CODE> rather than
<CODE>load</CODE>, so you would load the list compression code with
</P>

<PRE>(require "compress")
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The advantages of <CODE>require</CODE> over <CODE>load</CODE> are:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>if <CODE>compress.lisp</CODE> has already been loaded, it
   won't be loaded again
   
   <LI>if your Lisp uses some extension other than "lisp", you don't
   have to change anything, because <CODE>require</CODE> generates
   the appropriate extension automatically.
</UL>

<P>The disadvantages of <CODE>require</CODE> are</P>

<UL>
   <LI>it was underspecified in the Common Lisp reference manual, so
   different implementations do different things
   
   <LI>because of these differences, <CODE>require</CODE> was
   temporarily dropped from Common Lisp, so some implementations
   don't have it
   
   <LI>like <CODE>loop</CODE>, it has a religious aspect; the battle
   is between:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>the centralists, who favor defining all module dependencies
      in one place with <CODE>defsystem</CODE>, and
      
      <LI>the decentralists, who favor defining what a module depends
      on in the module
   </UL>
</UL>

<P>Unfortunately for the centralists, there is no Common Lisp
standard for <CODE>defsystem</CODE>. Unfortunately for the
decentralists, most implementations of <CODE>require</CODE> are
pretty weak.</P>

<H3>Page 52</H3>

<P><code>bfs</code> is a terrible name.Also, the nested 
<code>let</code>'s might be better done
as a subfunction, e.g.,</P>

<PRE>(defun breadth-first-search (end queue net)
  (if (null queue)
      nil
      (expand-queue end (car queue) (cdr queue) net)))

(defun expand-queue (end path queue net)
  (let ((node (car path)))
    (if (eql node end)
        (reverse path)
        (breadth-first-search end
                              (append queue
                                      (new-paths path node net))
                              net))))</PRE>
