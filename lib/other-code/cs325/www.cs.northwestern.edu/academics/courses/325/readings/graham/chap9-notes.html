<P>The claim that <CODE>=</CODE> is less strict than <CODE>eql</CODE>
is not strictly true, strictly speaking. <CODE>=</CODE> requires
numeric arguments, <CODE>eql</CODE> doesn't.</P>

<P>This finickiness though means that you should always use
<CODE>=</CODE> if you're dealing with numbers. If you use
<CODE>eql</CODE> or <CODE>equal</CODE>, you'll let bad non-numeric
values propagate longer. Catch bad values as early as possible.</P>

<P>The application is really neat and the code is mostly excellent,
<I>except</I> for the abundance of
<A HREF="../../readings/lisp-style.html#anonymous">anonymous constants</A>.</P>

<P><CODE>defsphere</CODE> is a poor name. <CODE>defxxxx</CODE> names
are usually for macros, but this is a normal function.
<CODE>create-sphere</CODE> or <CODE>new-sphere</CODE> would be better.
</P>

<P><CODE>intersect</CODE> is a poor name because it's very similar to
<CODE>intersection</CODE>, a Common Lisp function for intersecting
sets.</P>

<P>More importantly, this is a good example of code that should be
either <a href="chap9-data-driven.html">data-driven</a> or 
<a href="chap9-oo.html">object-oriented</a>. Consider what would happen if
we wanted to define a new kind of object, say a cube. We would have
to change the definition of <CODE>intersect</CODE> to</P>

<PRE>(defun intersect (s pt xr yr zr)
  (funcall (typecase s
              (sphere #'sphere-intersect)
              (cube #'cube-intersect))
           s pt xr yr zr))</PRE>

<P>That's easy. But where does this definition belong? It clearly
doesn't belong in the sphere definition file any more, nor does it
belong in the cube file. We need a new file where
<CODE>intersect</CODE> is defined. That file depends on each of the
object definition files. And every time we define a new kind of
object, we will have to redefine <CODE>intersect</CODE> in this file.
</P>

<P>The <a href="chap9-data-driven.html">data-driven</a> and 
<a href="chap9-oo.html">object-oriented</a> versions turn this dependency
around. In both versions, each object file depends on the file that
defines the <CODE>intersect</CODE> method. New object files can be
created freely, without ever changing the <CODE>intersect</CODE>
file.</P>
