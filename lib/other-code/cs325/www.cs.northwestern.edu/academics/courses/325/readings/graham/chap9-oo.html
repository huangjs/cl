<H2>The Problem</H2>

<P>Here's the definition of <CODE>intersect</CODE> given by Graham in
Chapter 9, extended to show what it would like if cubes were added:
</P>

<PRE>(defun intersect (s pt xr yr zr)
  (funcall (typecase s
              (sphere #'sphere-intersect)
              (cube #'cube-intersect))
           s pt xr yr zr))</PRE>

<P>As noted, this approach means that we will have to redefine
<CODE>intersect</CODE> every time we define a new kind of object .
Furthermore, whereever <CODE>intersect</CODE> should go, it
definitely doesn't belong in the spheres definition file, because of
the reference to cubes. On the other hand, we'd rather not put it in
the base file where <CODE>tracer</CODE> and so on are defined because
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>it would make the base file dependent on every object
   definition file
   
   <LI>we'd have to edit the base file and recompile it every time we
   added a new kind of object
   
   <LI>we'll get "undefined function" errors when
   <CODE>intersect</CODE> is compiled if any of the object files are
   missing, even if we don't need them
</UL>

<H2>The Object-Oriented Solution</H2>

<P>The minimal change to make Graham's code object-oriented is to
define intersect in the base file as a method on surfaces:</P>

<PRE>(defmethod intersect ((s surface) pt xr yr zr)
  (error "Unknown surface ~S" s))</PRE>

<P>This is the default method. It signals an error because there is
no default way to do ray intersection on an unknown kind of surface.
</P>

<P>In each object definition file, we'd define the appropriate
intersection method for the object, e.g.,</P>

<PRE>(defmethod intersect ((s sphere) pt xr yr zr)
  (let* ((c (sphere-center s))
         (n ...))
    ...)</PRE>

<P>That's all we need to do. When Common Lisp sees a call of the form
<CODE>(intersect </CODE><I><CODE>object</CODE></I><CODE>)</CODE>, it
will determine the appropriate method to use, based on the object.
</P>

<P>Our base file makes no explicit reference to any kind of object,
and each object file is independent of any other object file.</P>

<P>Note: it would be more typical object-oriented programming to
replace the structures with classes. In the base file, we put:</P>

<PRE>(defclass surface ()
  ((color :accessor surface-color :initarg :color)))</PRE>

<P>In the sphere definition file, we'd put:</P>

<PRE>(defclass sphere (surface)
  ((radius :accessor sphere-radius :initarg :radius)
   (center :accessor sphere-center :initarg :center)))</PRE>
