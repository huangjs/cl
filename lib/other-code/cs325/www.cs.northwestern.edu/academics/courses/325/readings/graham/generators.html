<H2>The Scanning Problem</H2>

<P>Here's a very common programming problem:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Repeatedly collect items from an input stream into
chunks, until the stream is empty.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For example, compilers for C and Pascal, and the Lisp reader,
collect characters from the input stream to form tokens, where each
token is either a name or number or punctuation element.</P>

<P>Another example is <TT>compress</TT> on page 37 of Graham's
<I>ANSI Common Lisp</I>. This function collects items from a list
into pairs of the form <TT>(</TT><I><TT>number
element</TT></I><TT>)</TT>, indicating how often each item is
repeated.</P>

<P>Ideally, we'd like our code to break down into two pieces:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>a function that collects some input elements and returns a
   chunk

   <LI>a function that applies the chunking function to the input
   until the input is emptied
</UL>

<P>The key problem in defining these scanning functions is that the
second function needs two values from the first function:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>a token or chunk of some kind

   <LI>the remainder of the input
</UL>

<P>Doing this cleanly, following the
<A HREF="../../readings/cardinal-rule.html">Cardinal Rule of Functions</A>, takes
some thought.</P>

<H2>Approach 1: Extra Parameters</H2>

<P>Graham's definition of <CODE>compress</CODE> defined a new
function, <CODE>compr</CODE>, that took three arguments:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the element being scanned for

   <LI>the current number of elements seen so far

   <LI>the input list remaining
</UL>

<P>The second and third arguments hold the two values needed, and
recursion was used to repeat the process until the list was emptied.
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the function <CODE>compr</CODE> is not very clear.
It has a terrible name, but it's hard to give it a good name because
it violates the <A HREF="../../readings/cardinal-rule.html">Cardinal Rule of
Functions</A> and mixes several tasks together.</P>

<H2>Approach 2: Chunk then Trim</H2>

<P>In this particular example, it turns out to not be too hard to use
a scanning function that takes an object and a list and returns the
length of the run of that element. We'll give a recursive definition
of the scanning function here:</P>

<PRE>(defun get-run (x l)
  (cond ((null l) 0)
        ((not (eql x (first l))) 0)
        (t (1+ (get-run x (rest l))))))
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>An iterative definition would be better here, because it would
handle runs of any length without overflowing the function call
stack.</P>

<P>Even better would be to take advantage of Common Lisp's large
library of sequence functions, e.g.,</P>

<PRE>(defun get-run (x l)
  (or (position x l :test-not #'eql))
      (length l)))</PRE>

<P>Or, if you want to avoid the "deprecated" <CODE>:test-not</CODE>
feature:</P>

<PRE>(defun get-run (x l)
  (or (position x l :test (complement #'eql))
      (length l)))</PRE>

<P><CODE>compress</CODE> can then be defined as a repeated call to
<CODE>get-run</CODE>:</P>

<PRE>(defun compress (l)
  (cond ((null l) nil)
        (t (let ((run (1+ (get-run (first l) (rest l)))))
             (cons (list run (first l))
                   (compress (nthcdr run l)))))))</PRE>

<P>Unfortunately, this version of <CODE>compress</CODE> is still a
little messy.</P>

<P>More importantly, it doesn't generalize well. After
<CODE>get-run</CODE> scans the list, it returns how many items it
found. This number is then used to trim the list. It works because
it's easy and relatively cheap to use the run-length to trim off the
items used so far, but this isn't always the case, plus it leads to
the messy nesting.</P>

<H2>Approach 3: Generators</H2>

<P>Because chunking streams is a common problem, we could go for a
general solution and define some functions that capture the
procedural flow underlying the general solution to this kind of
problem.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Note.
<TT><A HREF="../../programs/generators.lisp">generators.lisp</A></TT>
contains everything given below, except for the compression-specific
functions, plus a few extras.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>First, we define a new concept, a <I>generator</I>. A generator is
a function that you call to get elements from some source. That
source can be an input stream, a list of elements, an incrementing
counter, whatever.</P>

<P>A generator takes one argument:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>If the argument is <CODE>:get</CODE>, the current generator
   element is returned, if any.

   <LI>If that argument is <CODE>:test</CODE>, then <CODE>nil</CODE>
   is returned if there is no current element.

   <LI>If that argument is <CODE>:next</CODE>, the current element is
   advanced to the next one, if any, and the previous current element
   is returned.
</UL>

<P>(Odd as the last rule may seem, it tends to be the most useful of
the obvious options, just as <CODE>i++</CODE> is more commonly used
than <CODE>++i</CODE> in C and C++.)</P>

<P>We can define generators using closures. We can do this on as
needed basis, but a couple of generator-creating functions are
particularly useful and easy  to define.</P>

<P>For example, <CODE>make-number-gen</CODE> makes generators that
generate numbers from <I>M</I> to <I>N</I>. If no <I>N</I> is given,
the generator never runs out, i.e, never returns <CODE>nil</CODE> to
<CODE>:test</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>(defun make-number-gen (m &amp;optional n)
  #'(lambda (cmd)
      (ecase cmd
        (:test (and (numberp n) (&gt; m n)))
        (:get m)
        (:next (prog1 m
                    (unless (and (numberp n) (&gt; m n))
                      (incf m)))))))</PRE>

<P>Note the use of <CODE>prog1</CODE> to save and return the old
value of <CODE>m</CODE>.</P>

<P>The function <CODE>make-list-gen</CODE> makes generators that
generate elements from a list, from left to right.</P>

<PRE>(defun make-list-gen (l)
  #'(lambda (cmd)
      (ecase cmd
        (:test (null l))
        (:get (car l))
        (:next (pop l)))))</PRE>

<P>We could define more generator-making functions, but now let's
define three simple functions that will make code using generators
more readable, and less dependent on how they're implemented.</P>

<PRE>(defun empty-gen-p (gen)
  (funcall gen :test))
&nbsp;
(defun gen-elt (gen)
  (funcall gen :get))
&nbsp;
(defun advance-gen (gen)
  (funcall gen :next))</PRE>

<P>A good example of a generator-using function, and a handy one for
testing generators, is <CODE>extrude</CODE>. <CODE>(extrude
</CODE><I><CODE>n gen</CODE></I><CODE>)</CODE> returns a list of the
first N elements generated by the generator <I>gen</I>.</P>

<PRE>(defun extrude (n gen)
  (do ((l nil (cons (advance-gen gen) l))
       (i 0 (1+ i)))
      ((or (empty-gen-p gen) (&gt;= i n))
       (nreverse l))))</PRE>

<P>Here are some examples:</P>

<PRE>? (extrude 5 (make-number-gen 3))
(3 4 5 6 7)
&nbsp;
? (extrude 5 (make-number-gen 3 6))
(3 4 5)
&nbsp;
? (extrude 5 (make-list-gen '(a b c d e f)))
(A B C D E)
&nbsp;
? (extrude 5 (make-list-gen '(a b c)))
(A B C)</PRE>

<P>Now, with all this background out of the way, here is how we would
use generators for our compression problem.</P>

<P>First, we define <CODE>get-run</CODE>. It keeps calling the
generator until an element different than the given element is
returned. It returns the pair <CODE>(</CODE><I><CODE>number
elt</CODE></I><CODE>)</CODE> indicating how many occurrences of the
element it saw, counting the given one.</P>

<PRE>(defun get-run (elt gen)
  (do ((n 1 (1+ n)))
      ((or (empty-gen-p gen)
           (not (eql elt (gen-elt gen))))
       (list n elt))
    (advance-gen gen)))</PRE>

<P>Finally, <CODE>compress</CODE> just calls <CODE>get-run</CODE>
until the generator is exhausted.</P>

<PRE>(defun compress (l)
  (let ((gen (make-list-gen l)))
    (do ((run-pairs nil
                    (cons (get-run (advance-gen gen) gen)
                          run-pairs)))
        ((empty-gen-p gen)
         (nreverse run-pairs)))))</PRE>

<H2>Background</H2>

<P>Generators have a long history in Lisp and other functional
programming languages. The Common Lisp standard defines a
particularly sophisticated set of series, generators and gatherers.
See <CITE>Common Lisp The Language, 2nd edition</CITE>, by Guy L.
Steele Jr., Appendices A and B (Digital Press, 1990).</P>

<P>In Scheme, they're called streams. See <CITE>Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs</CITE>, Harold Abelson and Gerald
Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, Section 3.4 (MIT Press, 1985)</P>

<P>C++ has the same thing, only they call them iterators. Mitchell
Model explains quite nicely why C++ iterators are really not
iterators, and why real iterators would be hard to do in C++. See
<CITE>Data Structures, Data Abstraction: A Contemporary Introduction
Using C++</CITE>, Mitchell L. Model, p. 57 and Appendix C
(Prentice-Hall, 1994).</P>
