<div id="banner">The Lisp Interpreter</div>

<p>The heart of the Lisp interpreter is the "read-eval-print"
loop. That is, the interpreter does the following three jobs over
and over:</p>

<ul>
<li>read an input expression</li>

<li>evaluate the expression</li>

<li>print the results</li>
</ul>

<p>This loop can be written in Lisp itself very simply:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
(loop (print (eval (read)))

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, this doesn't take into account error handling,
multiple values, and so on, but much of what Lisp does, including
some things that seem unintuitive, can be understood by reasoning
about the above three step process.</p>

<h2>The Lisp Reader</h2>

<p>The input to the Lisp reader is a sequence of characters. The
output is a Lisp expression. The job of the reader is to convert
objects in <em>character world</em> to objects in <em>expression
world.</em></p>

<p><em>In character world,</em> there are no pointers, no lists,
no symbols, just characters like <tt>A</tt>, <tt>b</tt>,
<tt>`</tt>, and <tt>(</tt>. That is, <tt>(A B (C D) E)</tt> is
not a list, it is a sequence of parentheses, spaces, and letters.
<tt>"abc"</tt> is not a string, it is a sequence of letters.</p>

<p><em>In expression world,</em> there are no parentheses, no
spaces, no quote marks, just atoms and lists. That is, <tt>(A B
(C D) E)</tt> has no parentheses or spaces. It is a list of three
atoms and a list. <tt>"abc"</tt> has no quote marks. It is a
string with three characters.</p>

<p>The Common Lisp reader is quite complex (Steele has a full
description), but it works roughly like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the reader sees a character with read-macro function, it
calls that function, and returns whatever expression that
function returns. For example, <tt>'</tt> has a pre-defined
read-macro function that basically says <tt>(list (quote quote)
(read))</tt>. Thus, <tt>'abc</tt> becomes <tt>(quote
abc)</tt>.</li>

<li>If the reader sees a <tt>"</tt>, it collects characters until
it sees another <tt>"</tt>, and creates a string object with the
characters found between the string quotes. Thus, the 5
characters <tt>"abc"</tt> become the 3-character string with the
characters <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt>.</li>

<li>If the reader sees a digit (<tt>0</tt> - <tt>9</tt>), it
collects the digits that follow, and creates the number those
digits represent (base 10). Thus, the three characters
<tt>123</tt> become the single number <tt>123</tt>.</li>

<li>If the reader sees an alphabetic character, it collects
characters until it sees a space or parenthesis, and then
gets the symbol (using Lisp's <tt>intern</tt> function)
that has those
characters (converted to upper case) as its name. Thus the three
characters <tt>abc</tt> become the single <em>unique</em> symbol
<tt>ABC</tt>.</li>

<li>If the reader sees a left parenthesis, it reads more
characters, turning them into expressions, using all these rules,
until it sees a right parenthesis. Then it returns the list of
expressions read. Thus, the 7 characters <tt>(A B C)</tt> become
the 3 element list <tt>(A B C)</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Lisp Evaluator</h2>

<p>The Lisp evaluator takes an expression and returns an
expression. The
expression returned is called the value of the expression
evaluated. [I'll ignore expressions that return multiple
values here.]</p>

<p>The rules for evaluation are surprisingly simple. Graphically,
it looks like this:</p>

<img src="interpreter1.gif" width="435" height="236"> 

<p>First, there are two rules for atoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>The value of a symbol is looked up in the current lexical
environments. If none is found, <tt>symbol-value</tt> is called.
If that fails, there's an error (unbound variable).</li>

<li>The value of any other kind of atom is the atom itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three rules for lists that start with a symbol. If
they don't work, there's an error. The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the symbol names a special function, use the rules for
evaluation stored with the special function.</li>

<li>If the symbol has a macro function attached, <tt>apply</tt>
the macro function to the rest of the list, and evaluate the
result.</li>

<li>If the symbol has a normal function attached, evaluate the
other elements in the list, and <tt>apply</tt> the function to a
list of the values returned. The value the function returns is
the final value.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one other case for lists, but it appears rarely in
modern code:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the list has the form <tt>((lambda (vars) exps)
args)</tt>, then evaluate the arguments, and <tt>apply</tt> the
<tt>lambda</tt> function to the list of results. The value the
<tt>lambda</tt> returns is the final value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything that can be done with a <code>lambda</code> can also
be done with either <tt>let</tt> or
<tt>destructuring-bind</tt>.</p>

<h2>The Lisp Printer</h2>

<p>The input to the Lisp printer is a Lisp expression. The output
is a sequence of characters. The job of the printer is to convert
objects in <em>expression world</em> to objects in <em>character
world.</em></p>

<p>The printer's rules are pretty simple. They all involve taking
an expression and printing a sequence of characters:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the expression is an string, print <tt>"</tt> then the
characters in the string, then another <tt>"</tt>.</li>

<li>If the expression is a symbol, print the characters in the
symbol's name.</li>

<li>If the expression is a number, print the digits representing
that numbers (base 10).</li>

<li>If the expression is a list, print a left parenthesis, then
print each element in the list, with a space after each element
but the last, then print a right parenthesis.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also rules for printing structures, special
characters, and so on.</p>

<p>The purpose of the above rules is to make the following as
true as possible:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
(equal exp
      (read-from-string
         (write-to-string exp)))

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Often, however, that is not what we want. For example, we
probably want the string <tt>"Pick an option:"</tt> to appear on
the screen as</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Pick an option:
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>not</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Pick an option:""
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter is correct in so far as, if Lisp read it, it would
see a string, but we want people to read this message, not
Lisp.</p>

<p>Use functions like <tt>write-string</tt>, <tt>princ</tt>, and
the <tt>~A format</tt> command to print things "for people"
rather than for Lisp. However, don't use these functions for
printing debugging information. The information these functions
hide for readability may be exactly what you need for
debugging.</p>
