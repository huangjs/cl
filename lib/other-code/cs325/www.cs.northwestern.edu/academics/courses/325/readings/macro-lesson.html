<div id="banner">The Story of a Macro</div>

<p>This is a story about a real macro used by a number of
programmers at the Institute for the Learning Sciences for years.
It is an example of how <em>not</em> to design and implement a
macro.</p>

<p>The creator of the macro was an adept Lisp programmer. He
understood how macros worked, how to use backquote to define
them, and so on.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>A demo of a fairly mature program crashed. Nothing major had been
added to it, but a programmer had finished cleaning up its code.
After a fair amount of bug hunting, the programmer found the
change that broke the code. In essence, he had replaced 
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    (defmacro my-wait-for (n)
      `(wait-for ,n))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>with the seemingly more direct 
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    (defun my-wait-for (n)
      (wait-for n))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But, with the new version, <code>(my-wait-for 12)</code> never
waited! Why not? 
</p>

<h2>The Cause of the Problem</h2>

<p>The problem lay not with <code>my-wait-for</code>, but the macro
it called, <code>wait-for</code>. There were three ways to use
it: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>(wait-for 12)</code></dt>

<dd>waits for 12 seconds</dd>

<dt>(<code>wait-for #'foo)</code></dt>

<dd>calls <code>(foo)</code> until it returns a non-NIL
value</dd>

<dt><code>(wait-for (baz x y))</code></dt>

<dd>evaluates <code>(baz x y)</code> until it returns a non-NIL
value</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <em>macro</em> version of <code>my-wait-for</code> expanded
<code>(my-wait-for 12)</code> into <code>(wait-for 12)</code>,
which fits the <em>first</em> calling format.
</p>

<p>The <em>function</em> version of <code>my-wait-for</code>, on
the other hand, calls <code>(wait-for n)</code>, with
<code>n</code> = 12. This fits the <em>third</em> calling format,
and is interpreted as "wait until the expression <code>n</code>
is non-NIL." Since <code>n</code> is already non-NIL, no waiting
occurs.</p>

<h2>The Cause of the Cause of the Problem</h2>

<p><code>(wait-for 12)</code> looks like a function call. It looks
like it evaluates its argument. But it is doesn't. It looks at
the argument form to decide what to do. 
</p>

<p><code>wait-for</code> is a macro because its designer violated
the principle "one function to a function." He tried to do three
waiting tasks with one interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first task, "wait for <em>number</em>
seconds," shares a common calling format with the third task,
"wait for expression to be non-NIL." The rule "do the first task
only if the number is explicitly given" is not intuitive, easy to
forget, and a pain to live with. For example, it makes it
impossible to say</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
(wait-for *default-wait-period*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Fix</h2>

<p>The fix is not to write a comment that says "use only
literal numbers for wait times." Where would the comment
go? If we put it on the definition, it won't be seen by someone modifying
a call to <tt>wait-for</tt>. And it's pretty unlikely that programmers 
using <tt>wait-for</tt> will remember
to put a comment on every call to <tt>wait-for</tt> that says
"don't replace this number with a variable!"</p>

<p>Nor is it to change
<code>wait-for</code> to evaluate its argument and, if the result
is a number, do the first task, otherwise do the third. First, this rule counts 
on programmers knowing and
remembering that, in <tt>wait-for</tt>, unlike elsewhere in Lisp, a number is
not treated like other non-NIL values.
Second, exactly what is the rule? If <tt>exp</tt> in <tt>(wait-for exp)</tt>
returns <tt>nil</tt> the first few times, and then returns <tt>3</tt>, is that
a signal to stop waiting or a signal to wait three more seconds?
</p>

<p>The appropriate fix is to have two waiting forms, e.g., <code>(wait-for
<em>number</em>)</code>, which is a function, and
<code>(wait-until <em>expression</em>)</code>, which is a macro.
Each waiting form can then have simple unsurprising semantics.</p>
