<P>Suppose we were developing an AI program that reasoned about
people. One of the first things we'd need to represent is a person,
e.g.,</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">
   <TR>
      <TH>
         <P>Representation
      </TH><TH>
         <P>What it says
      </TH></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <PRE>john-1: male-person
  name = "John Smith"
  age = 22
&nbsp;</PRE>
      </TD><TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>A male person, named "John Smith," who is 22 years old.
         This piece of knowledge will be referred to internally by
         the identifying label <CODE>john-1</CODE>.
      </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <PRE>event-3: event
  actor = john-1
  action = ingest
  object = apple-92
&nbsp;</PRE>
      </TD><TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>An event where John ate an apple. This will be referred
         to internally by the label <CODE>event-3</CODE>.
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>This representation was invented and used by many AI researchers,
and given the generic name <EM>frame</EM> by Minsky in 1975. The
frame format can be used to represent objects, events, abstract
relationships, and so on.</P>

<P>Schank's Memory Organization Packets (MOPs) are frames primarily
used to represent episodic memory, that is, memories of particular
events and their generalizations.</P>

<P>For this course, we will use <A HREF="frames.html">a simple
implementation of MOPs and frames</A> that is easy to understand,
use, and extend.</P>

<H2>The structure of a frame</H2>

<P>A frame has (at least) the following parts:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>a name, e.g., <CODE>john-1</CODE>

   <LI>zero or more abstractions (classes to which the concept
   belongs), e.g., <CODE>male-person</CODE>

   <LI>zero or more <EM>slots</EM> that describe particular
   properties of the concept, e.g., <CODE>name = "John Smith"</CODE>
   and <CODE>age = 22</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>The name is for internal cross-reference purposes. Each frame has
one name, and there is at most one frame for each name. Names help us
keep straight two concepts that otherwise appear identical. For
example, we might know about two 22-year-old men named John Smith,
<CODE>john-1</CODE> and <CODE>john-2</CODE>.</P>

<H2>Abstractions of frames</H2>

<P>The classes to which a concept belongs are sometimes called the
<EM>abstractions</EM> of that concept. Conversely, the members of a
class are called its <EM>specializations</EM>.</P>

<P>An abstraction can itself be another frame. For example,</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">
   <TR>
      <TH>
         <P>Representation
      </TH><TH>
         <P>What it says
      </TH></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <PRE>male-person: person
  gender = male
&nbsp;</PRE>
      </TD><TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>the concept named <CODE>male-person</CODE> has the
         abstraction <CODE>person</CODE> and the slot <CODE>gender =
         male</CODE>
      </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <PRE>ingest-event: event
  action = ingest
&nbsp;</PRE>
      </TD><TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>the class of all events involving ingesting
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<H2>Slots of a frame</H2>

<P>The slots of a frame represent particular attributes of the
concept being represented, e.g., its age, color, component parts, and
so on.</P>

<P>A slot has two parts, a <EM>role</EM> and a <EM>filler</EM>. The
role names the attribute, and the filler gives its value.</P>

<P>For example, in the <CODE>john-1</CODE> frame, <CODE>name</CODE>
and <CODE>age</CODE> are roles, and <CODE>"John Smith"</CODE> and
<CODE>22</CODE> are fillers.</P>

<P>Fillers can be the names of frames, e.g., the filler
<CODE>john-1</CODE> in <CODE>event-3</CODE>.</P>

<H2>Hierarchies of abstractions</H2>

<P>Consider the following set of frames we might want to define,
ignoring for the moment the slots in each one:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><CODE>john-1</CODE>, a <CODE>male-person</CODE>

   <LI><CODE>male-person</CODE>, a <CODE>person</CODE>

   <LI><CODE>person</CODE>, an <CODE>animate-thing</CODE>

   <LI><CODE>animate-thing</CODE>, a <CODE>thing</CODE>
</UL>

<P>In AI, this is called an <EM>abstraction hierarchy</EM>. Another
name is <EM>conceptual taxonomy</EM>. Such hierarchies are often
drawn graphically, with the most abstract items at the top and the
most specific items at the bottom. For example, the chain of
abstractions above might be part of a larger tree of abstractions,
like this:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/john-tree.gif" WIDTH=301
HEIGHT=161 ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>Everything in this tree, except <CODE>john-1</CODE>, is an
abstraction. <CODE>john-1</CODE> is an <EM>instance</EM> (or
<EM>individual</EM>).</P>

<P>An instance can not have anything below it in the tree. That is,
while we might have an abstraction for "people named John," under
which <CODE>john-1</CODE> and <CODE>john-2</CODE> might fit, it
doesn't make sense to talk about instances of <CODE>john-1</CODE>.
<CODE>john-1</CODE> is a unique individual. We, most of the AI
community, and probably most average human reasoners, ignore such
philosophical conundrums as "how can John, age 22, be the same
individual as John, age 10, when all the cells in his body have been
replaced in those 12 years?"</P>

<H3>Immediate abstractions</H3>

<P>When we talk about the abstraction of some concept, we will
normally mean anything that is above the concept in the abstraction
hierarchy. Sometimes, we will talk about the "immediate abstractions"
of a concept to refer to those concepts that are exactly one link up
the hierarchy.</P>

<H2>Inheritance</H2>

<P>An important idea related to abstraction hierarchies is
<EM>inheritance</EM>. A concept inherits attributes of its
abstractions. If elephants are grey, and Clyde is an elephant, then
Clyde is grey. If Mary is a person, people are vertebrates, and all
vertebrates have bones, then Mary has bones.</P>

<H3>Inheritance as default knowledge</H3>

<P>There are several different ways to view inherited attributes. In
some of the earliest systems, such as Fahlman's NETL, concepts
inherited "virtual copies" of the slots on their abstractions.
Furthermore, the inherited slot was treated as a default, which could
be overridden. Thus, we might have</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">
   <TR>
      <TH>
         <P>Representation
      </TH><TH>
         <P>What it says
      </TH></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <PRE>elephant: animal
  color = grey
&nbsp;</PRE>
      </TD><TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>elephants are normally grey...
      </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <PRE>clyde-1: elephant
  color = white
&nbsp;</PRE>
      </TD><TD VALIGN=top>
         <P>...but Clyde is a white elephant
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>This interpretation of inherited attributes has problems, however.
The first problem is that if fillers can be overridden, then any
concept can be put under any other concept. For example, you could
say that a clock is an elephant with all the attributes of elephant
overridden appropriately. The second problem arises when you have
multiple inheritance.</P>

<H3>Multiple inheritance</H3>

<P><EM>Multiple inheritance</EM> occurs when a concept has more than
one one immediate abstraction. For example, John might be both a
person and a circus performer, where the class of circus performers
includes people, elephants, trained fleas, lions, tigers, bears, and
several other subclasses of animate things. Graphically, the
abstraction hierarchy looks something like this:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/john-dag.gif" WIDTH=391
HEIGHT=161 ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>The concept <CODE>john-1</CODE> inherits from both <CODE>
person</CODE> and <CODE>circus-performer</CODE>. Thus, we might
conclude that <CODE>john-1</CODE> has bones and wears colorful
costumes.</P>

<P>But what if the abstractions have conflicting default attributes?
The classic conundrum in this area of AI is the Nixon paradox. Nixon
was a Republican and a Quaker. Assume that by default Republicans
believe in war and Quakers don't. Then what does Nixon believe?</P>

<H3>Inheritance as constraint knowledge</H3>

<P>An alternative interpretation of inherited attributes is that they
are <EM>constraints</EM>. That is, if an abstraction says that
elephants are grey, then any instance of an elephant be some shade of
grey color.</P>

<P>Constraints can be refined by specializations of an abstraction,
but they can't be overridden. Thus, if some elephants are white, we
can't say elephants are grey. We might say instead that elephants as
a group have some color, then create two subclasses of elephants,
white ones and grey ones.</P>

<P>This approach resolves the examples above by not allowing them to
be represented in the first place. You can't put the clock class
under the elephant class, because the attributes of clocks don't
satisfy the constraints of elephants. If Nixon believes in war, then
either he is not a Quaker or Quakers don't have that constraint.</P>

<P>An abstraction such as Republican Quakers can be formed, but it
will have no members, because nothing can satisfy all the inherited
constraints.</P>

<H3>The right interpretation of inheritance</H3>

<P>The "inheritance of defaults" approach captures an important part
of human reasoning. If we hear that Mary went to Europe, we assume,
by default, that she flew, because trips to Europe are usually by
plane. The "scruffies" of AI, who are concerned with making systems
work, take the "defaults" approach. They accept the fact that their
systems <EM>could</EM> make clocks a kind of elephant, but believe
that reasonable learning algorithms won't do this.</P>

<P>The "inheritance of constraints" approach is appealing to the
"neats" of AI, because it avoids paradoxes and lends itself to
logical formulation. The hard, i.e., intractable, problem turns out
to be determining when one constraint could legally specialize
another. This is logically equivalent to theorem proving.</P>

<P>The obvious generalization algorithms, including those used in
some classic MOP-based programs, e.g., CYRUS, build
constraint-oriented hierarchies. This is because new abstractions are
formed by taking features common to some set of instances.</P>
