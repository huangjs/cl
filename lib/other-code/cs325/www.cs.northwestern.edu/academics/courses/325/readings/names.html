<H1>Naming Functions and Variables</H1>

<P>It's hard to over-emphasize the importance names bring to the
maintainability of code. Unfortunately, there is no formula for
generating names, just some good heuristics, and some major
"don't"'s.</P>

<P>Bad names reduce code maintainability. Names are bad when they
are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>cryptic, e.g., <CODE>bltx</CODE>

   <LI>hopelessly vague, e.g., <CODE>data</CODE>

   <LI>overly verbose, e.g., <CODE>first-item-to-delete</CODE>

   <LI>inaccurate, e.g., <CODE>num</CODE> for something that holds a
   list of numbers
</UL>

<P>Good names are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>short

   <LI>plain English or common convention

   <LI>accurate
</UL>

<H2>Function Names</H2>

<P>A function name should</P>

<UL>
   <LI>say <I>what</I>a function does, e.g., <CODE>get-test</CODE>,
   never <I>how</I>it does it, e.g., <CODE>search-recursively</CODE>

   <LI>be either a verb-object, e.g., <CODE>get-test</CODE>, or
   qualified-verb, e.g., <CODE>string-sort</CODE>

   <LI>be either semantic for application-specific functions, e.g.,
   <CODE>remove-test-case</CODE>, or generic for general utilities,
   e.g., <CODE>reverse-sequence</CODE>
</UL>

<P>Avoid names that are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>hopelessly vague, such as <CODE>get-data</CODE> or
   <CODE>run-process</CODE>

   <LI>verbose, such as <CODE>get-first-matching-item</CODE>; code
   calling this function will be hard to indent and present readably

   <LI>misleading, such as <CODE>get-square</CODE> for a function
   that actually returns a pair of squares

   <LI>ambiguous, such as <CODE>test-cases</CODE>; is this returning
   a set of test cases or testing some cases?
</UL>

<P>One common reason for difficulty in finding a short accurate name
for a function is because the function violates
<A HREF="cardinal-rule.html">the Cardinal Rule of Functions</A>.</P>

<H2>Variable Names</H2>

<P>Most of the rules that apply to function names apply to variable
names, as well, except that variables hold objects, not actions, so
verb-object and qualified-verb are inappropriate name forms.</P>

<P>In addition, when defining functions that are generic and reusable
for a wide variety of tasks, such as a "reverse sequence" function or
a "find anywhere" function, there are a number of common conventional
short variables names that can and should be used:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>x, y, and z for variables that can hold any kind of data

   <LI>i, j, k, and n for variables that hold numbers

   <LI>l and lst for variables that hold lists

   <LI>fn for a variable that holds a function object
</UL>

<P>Thus, a function that adds a number to every element in a list of
numbers could clearly be defined using:</P>

<PRE>(defun add-number (n l)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (i) (+ i n)) l))</PRE>

<P>The n and i suggest numbers and the l suggests list. There's
nothing wrong with</P>

<PRE>(defun add-number (num num-list)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (num-item) (+ num-item num)) num-list))</PRE>

<P>but it's more verbose without being any clearer. On the other
hand,</P>

<PRE>(defun add-number (x y)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (z) (+ x z)) y))</PRE>

<P>is definitely bad. The variables are too general and easily
confused with each other.</P>
