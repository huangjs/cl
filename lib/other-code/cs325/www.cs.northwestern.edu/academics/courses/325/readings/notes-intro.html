<P>These notes are a hodge-podge of discussions, written over the past 
15 years, as an adjunct to the readings and discussions for Computer Science CS 325
<em>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Programming</em>.

<P>This course and its instructor have changed a great deal in that time, 
so don't expect consistency.</P>

<p>There are three major themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lisp programming techniques
<li>General programming style
<li>Symbolic knowledge-based AI techniques
</ul>
