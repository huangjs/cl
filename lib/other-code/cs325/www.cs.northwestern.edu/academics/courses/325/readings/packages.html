<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>On the one hand, packages solve an important problem: reducing name conflicts
  between independent code modules. On the other hand, using them incorrectly
  can cause maddening file loading problems and, paradoxically, increased name
  conflicts. Most modern languages have something similar, e.g., namespaces in
  C++ and packages in Java, and all of them confuse novices.</P>

<H2>The Name Conflict Problem</H2>

<P>The name conflict problem comes up in large system development, no
matter what programming language is being used. Large systems are
broken into modules, that are developed by independent teams of
programmers, and then loaded together to form the final system. This
last step is usually called <I>system integration</I>.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, sometimes modules that worked perfectly when tested
individually fail to work when integrated. The cause is usually one
or more name conflicts, that is, the same name is used for a function
or global variable in two different modules in two different ways.
The hardest bugs to find are when the functions were intended to be
the same but differ slightly, for example, the function in one module
is an older version of the one in the other module.</P>

<P>Avoiding this problem involves two steps:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>When the system is broken down into separate modules, the
   functions and global variables each one "exports" to the whole
   system are carefully defined, and any potential name conflicts are
   resolved up front.

   <LI>When a module is implemented, any functions and variables
   defined that are not exported are hidden in some manner.
</UL>

<P>In Common Lisp, hiding is done with packages.</P>

<H2>What are Packages?</H2>

<P>Lisp, like other programming languages, distinguishes symbols, like <code>car</code>,
  from strings, like <code>&quot;car&quot;</code>. Symbols are used to name variables
  and functions. When your code is read, the Lisp reader converts characters into
  symbols, numbers, strings, and so on, according to the punctuation rules of
  Lisp. In order for your code to work, the reader has to return the same symbol,
  e.g., <code>car</code>, every time it reads the same sequence of characters,
  e.g., <TT>c</TT>, <tt>a</tt> and <tt>r</tt></TT>. To do this, the reader keeps
  a table of all the symbols it has seen. If a character sequence has not been
  seen before, a new symbol for it is created, stored in the table, and returned.
  If it has been seen before, the previously created symbol is returned. This
  table is called a package. </P>
<P>The current package is determined by the value of the special variable <code>*package*</code>.
  You can change the current package by either setting this variable, or by executing
  <code>(in-package <em>package-name</em>)</code>.</P>
<P>When you create a library of code, you make sure that the names you use don't
  conflict with any other code library by defining the library in a new package.
  You do this with <code>defpackage</code> and <code>in-package</code>, as described
  below. Then, anyone can use your library by simply loading the code files and
  typing <code>(use-package <em>package-name</em>)</code>. <code>use-package</code>
  makes a link between the current package and the package named. It does not
  copy anything. </P>
<P>The reader looks for symbols in the current package, as determined by <code>*package*</code>,
  then in the packages linked to that package by <code>use-package</code>. If
  it finds a matching symbol anywhere, it uses that one. Otherwise, it creates
  a new symbol in the current package.</P>
<P>Symbols in packages are marked as external or internal. When you call <code>use-package</code>,
  you only get external symbols.</P>
<P>Lisp comes with two packages pre-defined:</P>
<ul>
  <li><code>common-lisp</code> contains the symbols for all the variables and
    functions defined. Any code that uses just the symbols in this package should
    run in any Common Lisp implementation. Neither you nor any vendor should add
    any external symbols to this package.</li>
  <li><code>common-lisp-user</code> is the most common default package. It uses
    the <code>common-lisp</code> package plus other packages vendors provide with
    editing and debugging tools. It's also called <code>cl-user</code> for short.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Using Packages</H2>

<P>There are two steps to "packaging" a module:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>Creating the new package, using <TT>defpackage</TT>.
  <LI>Starting a file with module code with an <TT>in-package</TT> form.
</UL>

<H3>defpackage</H3>

<P>You can create a package with the following template:</P>

<PRE>(defpackage #:<em>package-name</em>
  (:use #:common-lisp ...)
  (:export #:<em>symbol1</em> #:<em>symbol2</em> ...))&nbsp;
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>Here's what the above does:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>It defines a package called <TT>package-name</TT>.
  <LI> It lists the packages that this package needs, i.e., packages that define
    functions used by code in this package. Almost always, you need the common-lisp
    package.
  <LI>It lists the symbols that are external in this package.
  <LI>It uses the special reader syntax <code>#:<em>symbol</em></code> to refer
    to all symbols.
</UL>
<p>The last point is easy to do but somewhat obscure to understand. Here's the
  problem: how do you refer to symbols in a package that don't exist yet? Suppose
  you wrote</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>(defpackage foo (:use common-lisp) (:export fun1 fun2))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lisp reader will read this form, and create the symbols <code>foo</code>,
  <code>fun1</code> and <code>fun2</code> in the current package. Then the Lisp
  evaluator would execute this form, create the package <code>foo</code> with
  the external symbols <code>fun1</code> and <code>fun2</code>. But look what
  happened: <code>fun1</code> and <code>fun2</code> have been created in the current
  package. If you try to use the <code>foo</code> package, you'll get a name conflict
  because <code>fun1</code> and <code>fun2</code> exist in both the current package
  and in <code>foo</code>. But of course you didn't want to put <code>fun1</code>
  and <code>fun2</code> into the current package.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this problem is this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>(defpackage &quot;FOO&quot; (:use &quot;COMMON-LISP&quot;) (:export &quot;FUN1&quot; &quot;FUN2&quot;))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This creates no symbols at read-time. It only uses name strings for symbols,
  not symbols. You have to use uppercase because standard Lisp stores all symbols
  with uppercase names. The standard Lisp reader is <em>case insensitive</em>.
  It converts all symbol characters to uppercase internally. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the above won't work in what Franz calls the &quot;modern&quot;
  version of Allegro. This version uses a case sensitive reader to support linking
  with Java, which uses case-sensitive names. The version stores standard Lisp
  names in lowercase. To make the above code work, you'd have to write <code>&quot;fun1&quot;</code>
  and <code>&quot;fun2&quot;</code> above, but then you'd have code that wouldn't
  work in standard Common Lisp.</p>
<p>A common alternative is to write this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>(defpackage :foo (:use :common-lisp) (:export :fun1 :fun2))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This uses keyword symbols. defpackage uses the internal symbol name strings
  so in standard Common Lisp, it will get <code>&quot;FUN1&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;FUN2&quot;</code>
  and in &quot;modern&quot; Allegro it will get <code>&quot;fun1&quot;</code>
  and <code>&quot;fun2&quot;</code>. This works but adds every symbol in two places:
  the package being defined and the keyword package. </p>
<p>The <code>#:</code> approach solves this problem. <code>#:</code> tells the
  Lisp reader to create a symbol but not put it in any package. As soon as the
  symbol's not used anywhere, it will be garbage-collected. </p>
<h3><a name="user"></a>User versus code packages</h3>
<p><code>common-lisp</code> is an example of a code package, i.e., a package intended
  to hold a library of useful functions. <code>common-lisp-user</code> is an example
  of a user package. Allegro for Windows defines many code packages, and a user
  package called <code>cg-user</code>. For this course, there are many code packages,
  such as <code>frames</code> and <code>mops</code>, and a user package <code>cs325-user</code>.</p>
<p>A user package is intended for interactive use in a Lisp listener window. You
  create a user package, link it to code packages, and make it the current package.
  A user package lets you control which code packages are present, hides the internal
  symbols in the code packages, and protects the code packages from accidental
  changes.</p>
<H3>Where to create packages</H3>

<P>There are two places you can put your <TT>defpackage</TT>:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>At the front of each file that defines code in that package

   <LI>In a separate "system definition" file
</UL>

<P>Use the first method for utility files that will be loaded into many systems.
  A programmer can simply load that file and not have to worry about package definition.
  Note that if the package definition uses packages other than <code>common-lisp</code>,
  you need to make sure those packages have already been loaded.</P>

<P>Use a system definition file for large applications. This can simply be all
  the package and file loading code you need. Or it can use a <code>defsystem</code>
  utility to define more complex system information, similar to a makefile in
  C and C++.</P>

<H3>in-package</H3>

<P>The very first form in a file (or second, if there is a <TT>defpackage</TT>)
  should be:</P>

<PRE>(in-package #:<em>package-name</em>)</PRE>

<P>This tells Lisp, the Lisp editor, if any, and all Lisp programmers, what package
  the code in this file is in. Some Lisp implementations will warn you if a file
  doesn't start with <TT>in-package</TT>. Others will assume you meant to say
  <TT>(in-package #:common-lisp-user)</TT>.</P>

<P>There are two simple good programming rules to follow:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>Always define a package because calling <TT>in-package</TT>.
  <LI>Use only one <TT>in-package</TT> per file.
</UL>

<H2>Classic Mistakes with Packages</H2>

<H3>Bad Timing</H3>

<P>Has something like this ever happened to you?</P>

<blockquote>
  <PRE>&gt; (load "tables")
&gt; (deftable find-rule)
Error: Undefined function: find-rule...
&gt; (use-package #:tables)
Error: Name conflict: deftable already exists in common-lisp-user</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>Here's what happened:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Lisp loaded <TT>tables</TT>, created the <TT>tables</TT>
   package, but didn't automatically connect that package to the
   current package. (Nor should it, since this might not be what you
   want.)


  <LI>Lisp read <TT>(deftable find-rule)</TT>. Since there was no <TT>deftable</TT>
    in the current package, the reader made one and added it to the current package.
    But of course this new symbol had no function attached, so an error occurred.
  <LI>Calling <TT>use-package</TT> caused Lisp to try and connect the current
    package to <TT>tables</TT>. It properly noticed that you already have a <TT>deftable</TT>,
    namely the one it just created in the previous expression.
</UL>

<P>First, you need to get into the habit of calling <TT>use-package
</TT>immediately after <TT>load</TT> or <TT>require</TT>.</P>

<P>Second, you can recover by using <TT>unintern</TT> to remove the offending
  symbols and calling <TT>use-package</TT> again. Many Lisp environments offer
  an automatic <TT>unintern</TT> as an error response option.</P>

<H3>Using in-package instead of use-package</H3>

<P>Do you do this?</P>

<PRE>&gt; (load "mops")
&gt; (in-package #:mops)
&gt; (load "my-code")
&gt; ...test stuff...</PRE>

<P>If you have, then you've missed the whole point of packages.</P>

<P>Packages are supposed to avoid name conflicts by hiding internal
function and variable names. But if you do an <TT>in-package</TT>,
you put your code into the package in question, thereby guaranteeing
that if you use any of the same names, you will clobber the package's
code.</P>

<P><TT>in-package</TT> should only appear at the front of files that
define or extend an existing package.</P>

<P>Use <TT>use-package</TT> to make the exported symbols of packages you need
  available to your code. Use in-package at the Listener window only to switch
  into <a href="#user">a user package</a>.</P>
<H3>Linking to User Packages</H3>

<P>Have you done something like this?</P>

<PRE>(defpackage #:rules
   (:use #:common-lisp-user ...))&nbsp;
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>If you have, then the odds are good that your code will not be
portable. In particular, when you load this code into another Common
Lisp system, you will get a name conflict, or unexpected "undefined
function" errors.</P>

<P><TT>common-lisp-user</TT> is a <I>working</I> environment. It
gathers together a number of packages, provides a home for temporary
test variables, and so on. What's in <TT>common-lisp-user</TT> varies
from implementation to implementation, and even from one release to
the next. The only guarantee is that <TT>common-lisp-user</TT> will
include the <TT>common-lisp</TT> package.</P>

<P>If your package uses <TT>common-lisp-user</TT>, two problems can
arise:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Your packages defines a function, say <TT>show-window</TT>
   with no conflict in your Lisp system. In another system, it turns
   out that <TT>common-lisp-user</TT> uses a graphics package that
   also defines <TT>show-window</TT>. Your code will accidentally
   redefine the built-in function.

   <LI>Your code uses a function, say <TT>show-window</TT>, which you
   mistakenly believe is standard Common Lisp. In fact, it's there
   because your <TT>common-lisp-user</TT> uses a graphics package.
   When your code is loaded into another system, it breaks with
   undefined function <TT>show-window</TT>.
</UL>

<P>Any package you create should use <TT>common-lisp</TT>
(<TT>lisp</TT> in Common Lisp 1), plus any other non-user packages it
needs. That way, you know exactly which functions you're getting and
which ones your code depends on.
