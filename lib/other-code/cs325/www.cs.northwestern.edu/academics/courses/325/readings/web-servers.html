<H2>Web Overview</H2>

<P>A web server is just a machine connected to the Internet,
running a computer program that listens to requests for content,
such as HTML files.
Those requests come from programs, such as browsers, running on
other computers also connected to the Internet. For this to work,
there has to be an agreed language for both the requests and
what's sent back. That
language is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</P>

<P>Rather than repeat what's been written many times, I refer
you to</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet-infrastructure.htm/printable" target="_top">
How the Internet Works</a> for
a basic description
of many aspects of how the web works.</LI>

<LI>
<a href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/" target="_top">
HTTP Made Really Easy</A>
by James Marshall, which focusses on the basics of HTTP
in particular.

<H2>Web Servers with Lisp</H2>

<P>The nice thing about the web is that all
communication between programs is done using HTTP,
which uses simple commands in plain text.
That simplicity means that you
can write a web server or browser in any language
you like, as long as it lets you read and write
to the network.</P>

<P>Writing a server or browser from scratch would be
pretty tedious, though. Fortunately, many languages
now have code libraries to take care of such details as
reading and writing characters to the network,
parsing HTTP commands, creating threads (lightweight
parallel processes) for each request to support simultaneous
users, and so on.</P>

<P>For Common Lisp there are two major code libraries for
web services:</P>

<UL>
<LI>
Franz, Inc.'s
<a href="http://opensource.franz.com/aserve/" target="_top">AServe library</a>
for Allegro Common Lisp for PC's
running Windows and Unix.
</LI>

<LI>John Mallory's
<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html" target="_top">
CL-HTTP</a>,
which runs on many Common Lisp's, including Macintosh Common
Lisp, LispWorks, and older versions
of Allegro.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>In this course, we use Franz, Inc.'s
AServe library, for a number of reasons:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Most students are using Allegro, so they already
have AServe available and ready to load.</LI>

<LI>AServe is very
similar to HTTP libraries for other languages. For example,
AServe's responses and entities are much like
Java's requests and responses.</LI>

<LI>AServe's HTML macro is simple to explain, easy to implement, and
extends automatically to new HTML elements and XML.</LI>

<LI>AServe has better (or at least more easily found) documentation
than CL-HTTP.</LI>

<LI>It's a lot easier to implement AServe on top of CL-HTTP
than CL-HTTP on top of AServe.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For those students not using Allegro, there
is 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/" target="_top">
a portable AServe library</a> that runs in a number of 
Common Lisp's. I use it in LispWorks Personal Edition.</P>.

<H2>How to Use AServe</H2>


<P>Switch to the <tt>cs325-user</tt> package in your Listener window:</P>

<blockquote><pre>(in-package :cs325-user)</pre></blockquote>

<P>You make URL's available to users with functions like
<code>publish</code>, <code>publish-file</code>,
and <code>publish-directory</code>.
These functions link specific URL's to Lisp functions or HTML files.
(This corresponds to servlet mappings
in Java web applications.)</p>

<p>To test AServe on your
system, 

<ul>
<li>load the AllegroServe code:
<ul>
<li>Allegro Users: just type <code>(require :aserve)</code></li>
<li>Others: load the file <code>portableaserve/INSTALL.lisp</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>load the example AServe code in
<code><a href="../programs/test-aserve.lisp">test-aserve.lisp</a></code>
</li>

<li>start the server by evaluating <code>(net.aserve:start :port 8000)</code></li>

<li>point a browser to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>8000 is a <em>port</em>. Ports are simply numbers operating systems use
as a kind of address to determine which program should process a
network message. Low numbers are pre-assigned to standard services, e.g., 
80 is the default for a web server. For development, use a safe high number.
In the unlikely case that your machine is already using port 8000
for some service, try some other number over 1024. Use that number in
your <code>localhost</code> URL.</p>

<p class="quote">If you have a firewall running on your machine, and
you should, the first time you start the server, you should get an
alert saying that your Lisp is trying to access the network. Tell
your firewall this is OK.</p>

<p>The URL <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>
should take you to a page published by the code in
<code><a href="../programs/test-aserve.lisp">test-aserve.lisp</a></code>.
If it doesn't, look at the error message you got.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the error says a connection could not be made, then
make sure AServe started without error, that
you gave the right port number, and that your firewall, if any,
isn't rejecting messages on that port.</li>
<li>If the errors says the page could not be found, then 
the server is running. Try loading 
<code><a href="../programs/test-aserve.lisp">test-aserve.lisp</a></code>.
again and make sure there are no errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The home page published by 
<code><a href="../programs/test-aserve.lisp">test-aserve.lisp</a></code>.
has links to several examples of things you can
do with the AServe package:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8000/apropos">http://localhost:8000/apropos</a> should take you to a page that lets you look
up all symbols defined in your Lisp</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8000/base/fields.html">http://localhost:8000/base/fields.html</a> you to a simple example of an
HTML form that can be filled in and sent to Lisp for processing
by Lisp code</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8000/critic">http://localhost:8000/critic</a> should take you to a page where you can 
submit Lisp code to the Lisp Critic in a
web page</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all very simple examples. Use the code in
<code><a href="../programs/test-aserve.lisp">test-aserve.lisp</a></code>
to guide you 
when creating other Lisp-based web pages.</p>


<p>While your server is running, any machine on the Internet can
access your pages. To access your server from another machine,
replace <code>localhost</code> with your server's Internet name or IP address.
For example, if your machine's IP address was
555.100.10.100, then you could critique Lisp by
typing this URL in your browser:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>http://555.100.10.100:8000/cs325/critic</pre></blockquote>

<P>To avoid hackers attacking your system, and to reduce system
load, shut down AServe when testing is done:</P>

<blockquote><pre>(net.aserve:shutdown)</pre></blockquote>
