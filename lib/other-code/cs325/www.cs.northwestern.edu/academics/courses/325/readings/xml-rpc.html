<P>
<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> is a very simple standard XML-based protocol for calling
web services. XML-RPC is a much smaller
protocol than the other leading XML-based web service protocol,
<a href="http://www.soapware.org/">SOAP</a>. The complete
specifications for XML-RPC in HTML is less than 20K bytes.
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/">The specifications for SOAP 1.2</a> 
in HTML is 8 times as large. As a result, there are
<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/implementations">many implementations</a>
of XML-RPC in many different languages,
including Perl, Python, C++, Java, Lisp, etc.
A number of examples of using XML-RPC in various languages is given at 
<a href="http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/xmlrpc-howto/xmlrpc-howto.html">
the XML-RPC How To site</a>.
</p>

<p>XML-RPC is very stable. XML-RPC's inventor, Dave Winer, has resisted
changes, even quite modest and reasonable ones, because they would break
existing XML-RPC servers and clients.</p>

<p>A personal history by Winer of how XML-RPC and SOAP relate is 
<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$555">here</a>.
</p>

<p>In Lisp, an easy way to get started with XML-RPC is
to use the <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml-rpc/">The S-XML-RPC library</a>.
This document describes how to set up the library, and call and define
XML-RPC services.</p>

<h2>Download S-XML and S-XML-RPC</h2>

<p><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml/">S-XML</a> is an XML parser, 
like <a href="clocc-xml.html">the CLOCC XML parser</a>. 
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml-rpc/">S-XML-RPC</a> is an 
XML-RPC library that uses the S-XML parser.
The S-XML parser isn't as complete as the CLOCC parser, but
it's sufficient for our needs.</p>

<p>Instructions on getting both S-XML and S-XML-RPC
are at their respective web sites. Unfortunately, the standard distribution 
omits the code
needed for Allegro Common Lisp, so Allegro users
should use my <a href="../../programs/s-xml-rpc.zip">s-xml-rpc.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Compile and load ASDF, S-XML and S-XML-RPC</h2>

<p>To compile and load these libraries, 
you need <a href="http://constantly.at/lisp/asdf/">ASDF</a>.
ASDF (A System Definition Facility) is
a Lisp equivalent of <tt>make</tt> in Unix or <tt>Ant</tt>.
ASDF lets you define how code files depend on other code files
so that, with one operation, you can load, and compile if necessary,
a library and all the files it depends on. ASDF uses the
same syntax and concepts as an earlier package called
<tt>DEFSYSTEM</tt>.</p>

<p>ASDF comes with several Lisps, including SBCL, OpenMCL,
and Allegro. In those cases,
you should be able to just say <code>(require :asdf)</code>
to load ASDF.</p>

<p>For other Lisps, including Lispworks, you can use the version 
of ASDF included in  <a href="../../programs/s-xml-rpc.zip">s-xml-rpc.zip</a>.
Load <tt>asdf.lisp</tt> before you do the remaining
steps.</p>

<p>To use ASDF to load a library like S-XML or S-XML-RPC, you:<p>

<ul>
<li>tell ASDF the directory containing the files in the library</li>

<li>load the <tt>.asd</tt> file that has the system definition for the library</li>

<li>tell ASDF to use the system definition to 
load the library, compiling if necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>For CS 325 students, I've put all these steps into the file 
<a href="../programs/load-s-xml.lisp">load-s-xml.lisp</a>. 
<em>The code in this file runs
in the <code>cs325-user</code> package</em>.
Put this file in the same directory that contains
the S-XML and S-XML-RPC directories. Load <tt>load-s-xml.lisp</tt>.
to compile and load both S-XML and S-XML-RPC, and 
add S-XML-RPC to the packages used by <code>cs325-user</code>.</p> 

<h2>Calling XML-RPC Methods</h2>

<p>The S-XML-RPC web site gives several examples of web
services available to the public for testing the XML-RPC
installations. In addition, I found another site that has
XML-RPC methods to do some trivial math. 
Try all three of these XML-RPC
method calls:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(xml-rpc-call
   (encode-xml-rpc-call "currentTime.getCurrentTime")
   :host "time.xmlrpc.com")

(xml-rpc-call
   (encode-xml-rpc-call "examples.getStateName" 41)
   :host "betty.userland.com")

(xml-rpc-call
  (encode-xml-rpc-call "math.SumAndDifference" 5 2)
  :host "www.cookcomputing.com"
  :url "/xmlrpcsamples/math.rem")</pre></blockquote>

<p>The function <code>encode-xml-rpc-call</code> constructs 
a string with 
the XML to send to the server, e.g.,</p>

<blockquote><pre> > (encode-xml-rpc-call "examples.getStateName" 41)
"&lt;methodCall>&lt;methodName>examples.getStateName&lt;/methodName>
&lt;params>&lt;param>&lt;value>&lt;int>41&lt;/int>&lt;/value>&lt;/param>
&lt;/params>&lt;/methodCall>"</pre></blockquote>

<p><code>xml-rpc-call</code> then sends this XML to the server
specifed. The server consists of a host, a port, and a path,
specified by the keywords <code>host</code>, <code>:port</code>
and <code>:url</code>, which default
to <code>localhost</code>, <code>80</code>, and <code>/RPC2</code>,
respectively.</p>


<h3>Defining XML-RPC Methods</h3>

<p>An appropriate XML-RPC service is one that:</p>

<ul>
<li>involves modest amounts of data traffic</li>

<li>requires modest computational requirements on the server</li>

<li>would not be easily doable on the client without additional software</li>

<li>would not be called in a tight time-sensitive loop</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a web service that retrieve book information
given an ISBN number would make sense, but one that retrieved 
the contents of the book, would be
inappropriate as well as illegal. Also inappropriate
would be a web service to calculate square roots, because this
is so easily done on the client machine.</p>

<p>For demonstration purposes, I'll define a method, 
<code>lisp.GCD</code>, that
takes two numbers and returns their greatest common divisor.
This is trivial in Lisp and is just to show how the services are
defined.</p>

<p>To define a web service method in S-XML-RPC, you just need to define
a function in the <code>s-xml-rpc-exports</code> package. Because
XML-RPC is case-sensitive, but Lisp isn't, we need to protect
the name of our method by using Lisp's vertical bar notation.
So the full name of our method, including the package, will
be <code>s-xml-rpc-exports::|lisp.GCD|</code>. In some languages,
this name might imply that <code>GCD</code> is a method of
some class or package called <code>lisp</code>, but here it's just
a name, designed to look like a normal XML-RPC method name.</p>

<p>Since Lisp already defines a function to calculate
greatest common divisor, we're done:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(defun s-xml-rpc-exports::|lisp.GCD| (m n)
  (gcd m n))</pre></blockquote>
 
<p>S-XML-RPC will take care of converting the input parameters
from the strings that were sent over the network
into numbers, and converting the returned value back into
a string to send back to the client.</p>

<p>
The parameters for XML-RPC methods should be kept simple, i.e., 
numbers, strings, and simple lists
and structures, because of that's what the XML-RPC protocol allows.
Similarly, the function should return either a number, string,
simple list, or structure.</p>

<p>"Structure" here means an XML-RPC structure,
which is a list of name-value pairs. In S-XML-RPC client code
in Lisp, you create an XML-RPC structure with
<code class="code-syntax">(s-xml-rpc:xml-rpc-struct <em>key value key value ...</em>)</code>.
In XML-RPC server code in Lisp, you get at parts of an XML-RPC
structure with 
<code class="code-syntax">(s-xml-rpc:get-xml-rpc-struct-member <em>struct key</em>)</code>.
The XML-RPC method <code>math.SumAndDifference</code> shown
in the examples above returns an XML-RPC structure to hold
the sum and difference.</p>

<h3>Running an S-XML-RPC Server</h3>

<p>To start the S-XML-RPC server:</p>

<blockquote><pre>(setq *xml-server* (start-xml-rpc-server :port 8080))</pre></blockquote>

<p>We store the name of the server in a variable so
that we can easily stop it later.</p>

<p>If you've defined the <code>lisp.GCD</code> method above, then you can now
call it from Lisp, like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>> (xml-rpc-call
    (encode-xml-rpc-call "lisp.GCD" 12155 130130)
    :port 8080)
715</pre></blockquote>

<h3><a name="testing-xml-rpc">Testing your server from other languages</a></h3>

<p>Of course, using Lisp to call Lisp doesn't prove much. More interesting is to call
your XML-RPC method from a totally different client, in another language,
perhaps on a different machine. Two examples are given below.</p>

<h4><a name="python-xml-rpc">Testing your server with Python</a></h4>

<p>If you have Python installed, then it's easy to test XML-RPC because
Python comes with an XML-RPC library. Just start your Python interpreter,
import the library <tt>xmlrpclib</tt>, and call the function
<tt>xmlrpclib.ServerProxy</tt> to create an object that
can be then used to call your XML-RPC methods. How it works
may be a bit confusing, but the calling pattern is quite simple.
For example, to call our GCD function above:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre># <em>get the library</em>
import xmlrpclib  

# <em>get the server proxy and use it to call lisp.GCD()</em>
xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8080/RPC2").lisp.GCD(12155, 130130)</pre>
</blockquote>

<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-pyth10.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h4><a name="java-xml-rpc">Testing your server with Java</a></h4>

<p>The easiest way test to XML-RPC with Java is to 
use <tt>xml-rpc-test.jar</tt>, a Java Archive I created by
merging version 1.3 of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/codec/">the Apache Commons Codec library</a>,
and version 2 of 
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/xmlrpc2/">the Apache XML-RPC library</a>. 
(Note: version 3 of this library does not provide a utility class
for calling XML-RPC directly.)</p>

<p>To install, download
<a href="../programs/xml-rpc-test.jar">xml-rpc-test.jar</a>
to some directory, e.g., <tt>c:\java\xml-rpc\</tt>.</p>

<p>To test an XML-RPC method:

<ul>
<li>Start a command shell.</li>

<li>Change to the directory where you put <tt>xml-rpc-test.jar</tt>.

<li>Type <tt>java -jar xml-rpc-test.jar <em>server-url method-name arguments...</em></tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, to test the state name service,

<blockquote><pre>C:\java\xml-rpc><span class="input">java -jar xml-rpc-test.jar http://betty.userland.com/RPC2 examples.getStateName 32</span>
New York</pre></blockquote>

<p>To test the GCD service above:</p>

<blockquote><pre>C:\java\xml-rpc><span class="input">java -jar xml-rpc-test.jar http://localhost:8080/RPC2 lisp.GCD 12155 130130</span>
715</pre></blockquote>

<p>When you're done, for safety, be sure to stop the XML-RPC server in Lisp, with</p>

<blockquote><pre>(stop-server *xml-server*)</pre></blockquote>
