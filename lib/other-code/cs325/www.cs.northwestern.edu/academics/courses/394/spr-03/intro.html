Software Project Management
</DIV>

<HR>

<P>This is a course about software development "in the large" and
"for real." That means, software development</P>

<UL>
   <LI>of very large systems (thousands of lines of code, also known
   as KLOCs)
   
   <LI>by multi-programmer teams
   
   <LI>to meet client needs
   
   <LI>with deadlines and budgets
</UL>

<H2>The Problem</H2>

<P>The field of software engineering arose a number of years ago in
response to a perceived <B>software crisis</B>: While there seems to
be a doubling each year in the number of software applications
demanded, the size of such applications, the complexity of such
applications, and mission criticality of such applications, there has
been almost no increase in programmer productivity or program
quality.</P>

<P>To put it bluntly, much of what is developed is:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>late
   
   <LI>buggy
   
   <LI>and not very useful
</UL>

<P>The crisis arises because standard programming techniques, such as
those you've learned at Northwestern, are totally inadequate for real
world software needs. The consequences have been much worse than
getting a C-:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Slipped delivery dates in large software projects, from
   operating systems to air traffic control system to spreadsheets,
   have cost companies millions of dollars, driving some out of
   business.
   
   <LI>Bugs in software controlling medical devices and traffic
   systems have <B>killed</B> people!
</UL>

<H2>The Cause</H2>

<P>These problems arise because fundamental, critical questions were
either not asked or not properly answered:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>How long will it take to build this system? How many people
   will have to work on it? How do you know?
   
   <LI>Exactly what will it do? How usable will it be? How do you
   know?
   
   <LI>How do you know it will work correctly? How can you prove it?
   
   <LI>How hard will it be to change? How do you know?
</UL>

<H3>Everything you know is not enough</H3>

<P>All of you have probably tried to answer the first set of
questions in some form for various course assignments, and perhaps in
some programming job. Chances are that for at least some of your
projects, you weren't even close. Scale the error in your estimates
for a one-person three-week project to a five-person six-month
project and you'll see how bad it can get.</P>

<P>Most you have probably never had to answer the remaining
questions. What your course projects were supposed to do was decided
by someone else (the professor or the textbook) and no one really
used the results anyway.</P>

<P>Step back and look at the entire software development process,
which is typically broken down into these phases:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>determining what the customer needs (requirements analysis)
   
   <LI>determining what should be built and how it should be
   organized (system design)
   
   <LI>implementation of the system design
   
   <LI>testing, including validation, verification, etc.
   
   <LI>delivery, including integration into existing systems,
   training, monitoring, etc.
   
   <LI>maintenance, including bug fixes, adjusting to platform
   changes, extensions and upgrades
</UL>

<P>Chances are good that your programming courses have only dealt
with implementation and perhaps a little design. Implementation, the
part where you've spent countless hours, and the part that probably
defines what software development is for you, is in fact only a small
part of the overall process.</P>

<P>In fact, in most cases, you can tell a well-run project from one
that is doomed by how much of the effort is spent on implementation.
If implementation accounts for more than 20% of the project effort,
the project is in trouble. Most likely, there's</P>

<UL>
   <LI>no testing plan, so little testing will occur and the product
   will be bug-ridden
   
   <LI>no integration plan, so the product may not even install and
   run at all
   
   <LI>no design documentation, so changes to fix bugs will cause
   more bugs and probably undo some functionality
   
   <LI>no requirements analysis, so what's delivered won't actually
   support what the customer needs to do
</UL>

<H2>Approaches to Solutions</H2>

<P>There are many, many different approaches to resolving these
problems, some complementary, some contradictory. These approaches
can be organized under two key themes.</P>

<H3>Better Management</H3>

<P>Management approaches including the following techniques:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>better metrics for estimating how much effort it will take to
   develop software
   
   <LI>better methods for tracking the development efforts,
   especially across large teams
   
   <LI>methodologies for software development, that
   
   <UL>
      <LI>specify a recipe for the development process and
      
      <LI>provide tools to improve thinking and record keeping, such
      as
      
      <UL>
         <LI>formalized notations
         
         <LI>paper forms
         
         <LI>CASE (computer aided software engineering) tools
      </UL>
   </UL>
</UL>

<H3>Quality Assurance</H3>

<P>Quality approaches include the following techniques:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>rigorous requirements analysis, to determine what the client
   needs and how the business works
   
   <LI>design notations, to specify data and functional relationships
   in a formal but language independent way
   
   <LI>program correctness tools
   
   <LI>sophisticated test suite development techniques
   
   <LI>rapid prototyping and usability testing very early in the
   development process
</UL>

<H2>Course Goals</H2>

<P>In no way can a one-quarter undergraduate course cover everything
in what is a very broad field with a wide variety of subareas, a wide
variety of often contradictory methodologies, and a lot of debate
about works and what doesn't.</P>

<P>Therefore the goals of this course are modest but concrete. I want
to make you better software engineers because you will</P>

<UL>
   <LI>know what the big problems are and understand their
   seriousness
   
   <LI>recognize these problems in your own software development
   situations
   
   <LI>be able to resolve these problems in a well-reasoned manner
   using sound methods
   
   <LI>be able to learn about and apply more structured methodologies
   as required
</UL>

<H2>Course Activities</H2>

<P>To that end, this course will consist of a number of activities
and challenges:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Testing and code review: You'll produce an in-depth test suite
   for code modules you've written for other courses or jobs. You
   also participate in structured walkthroughs on such code.
   
   <LI>Requirements analysis: You'll create a requirements analysis
   document for a medium size project, using standard UML notations.
   
   <LI>Project plan: You'll create a risk-driven iterated project
   development plan for the project.
</UL>
