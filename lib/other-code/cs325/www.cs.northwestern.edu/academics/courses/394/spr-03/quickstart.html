Software Project Management
</DIV>

<HR>

<H2>Goal</H2>

<P>This course is about becoming a <em>professional</em> software developer, 
not just a programmer. The course focuses on 3 topics most critical to project
success or failure and least familiar to computer science and engineering
students:</P>

<ul>
<li><em>Serious</em> testing of code</li>
<li>Requirements gathering and analysis</li>
<li>Project planning</li>
</ul>

<P>We'll spend approximately 1/3 of the course on each topic, and each
topic will lead to a deliverable. Programming is a major part of testing,
but <b>not</b> of the other 2 topics.</P>

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

<P><B>Significant</B> project development experience, such as can be
found in a multi-quarter CS 399 development project, <B>CS 343</B> (Operating systems)
or similar courses. Industry experience is not required but very helpful.</P>

<P>In addition, you <B>must</B> have ready access to the university
network and to email.</P>

<H2>Textbooks</H2>

<P>There are two textbooks for this course:</P>

<ul>
<li>William Wake's 
<a href="http://www.aw.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0201733978,00.html">
Extreme Programming Explored</a>: This will drive the unit on testing,
and also introduce you to agile software development.</li>

<li>Pankaj Jalote's 
<a href="http://www.aw.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0201737213,00.html">
Software Project Management in Practice</a>:
This will drive the unit on project planning and management.</li>
</ul>


<P>These are both short very practical books. They should be available
at the university book store, as well as at Amazon and other online
sellers.</P>

<P>The requirements topic will be use notes and
<a href="resources.html">online resources</a>.</P>


<H2>Grade Items</H2>

<P>There are three core class activities:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Testing and code review: You'll produce an in-depth test suite
   for a body of code. You
   also participate in structured walkthroughs on such code.
   
   <LI>Requirements analysis: You'll create a preliminary requirements analysis
   document for a medium size project, using standard UML notations.
   
   <LI>Project plan: You'll create a risk-driven iterated project
   development plan for the project.
</UL>

<P>You will be graded on:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Independent initiative in tracking down materials in each of
   the theme areas,
   
   <LI>Quality of materials submitted (programs and reports), and
   
   <LI>Class participation, including
   
   <UL>
      <LI>brief presentations of materials you've found in texts,
      journals, and the net
      
      <LI>well-reasoned commentary and questions on such
      presentations
   </UL>
</UL>
