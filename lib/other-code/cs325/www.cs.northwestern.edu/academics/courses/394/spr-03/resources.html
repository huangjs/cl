<H1>Resources for Tasks</H1>

<P><A NAME="task1"></A></P>

<H2>Task 1: Testing</H2>

<H3>xUnit Frameworks</H3>

<P>A list of xUnit testing frameworks is available at:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><A HREF="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This list is NOT complete. It omits for example things like
<A HREF="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HttpUnit</A> (which is an
add-on for JUnit for web testing) and
<A HREF="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/">jWebUnit</A>, a simpler
but less flexible successor to HttpUnit. If you're not sure if
there's a xUnit framework for you, try guessing at what it would be
called in Google. (Sorry, "cobolunit" had no results.)</P>

<H3>Refactoring</H3>

<P>Refactoring is a suite of well-defined well-structured techniques
for making code cleaner, less redundant, and more reusable.</P>

<P>Martin Fowler keeps <A HREF="http://www.refactoring.com/"> the
Refactoring Home Page</A>.</P>

<P>Bill Wake (author of <STRONG>Extreme Programming
Explored</STRONG>) has <A HREF="http://www.xp123.com/xplor/">an
XPlorations site</A> with a number of good essays on refactoring.
<A NAME="task3"></A></P>

<H1>Task 3: Project Planning and Management</H1>

<H2>Effort Estimation</H2>

<P><A HREF="http://www.rspa.com/spi/project-plan.html">Roger
Pressman's resource page</A> -- lots of good links</P>

<P>There are quite a few articles on using Use Case Points for
estimating project size, all quite similar to what's in the Jalote
book). The Ribu thesis is the longest, but the most relevant to Task
3, because of her analysis of student use of UCP.</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="http://www.globaltester.com/sp7/usecasepoint.html">Use
   Case Points</A> by Jeff Nyman
   

   <LI><A HREF="http://www.cognizant.com/cogcommunity/presentations/Test_Effort_Estimation.pdf">Test
   Effort Estimation using Use Case Points</A> [PDF] by Suresh
   Nageswaran
   

   <LI><A HREF="http://www.rational.com/media/whitepapers/finalTP171.PDF">The
   Estimation of Effort Based on Use Cases</A> [PDF] by John Smith is
   much more in-depth, and discusses how detailed use cases have to
   be in order to make estimates from them.
   

   <LI><A HREF="http://www.stud.ifi.uio.no/~kribu/oppgave.pdf">Estimating
   Object-Oriented Software Projects with Use Cases</A> [PDF] by
   Kirsten Ribu, a 150 page PhD thesis studying UCP. You should
   definitely read her chapter on student's using UCP and what
   mistakes they made.
</UL>

<P>A predecessor to Use Case Points is <B>Function Points</B>.
Function Points are a way of characterizing how complex a system is,
even though it hasn't been built yet. FP was first applied to
primitive form-based data base applications, and even though it has
many adherents today, I never saw any description on-line or in
textbooks that showed how to apply FP to modern interactive systems.
However, that seems to have changed:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="http://www.ifpug.com/freestuff.htm">The Free Stuff
   page</A> at Software Metrics contains a detailed Function Point
   Training Booklet, with more modern application examples, and other
   tools for doing FP analysis.
   
   <LI><A HREF="http://www.ifpug.com/Articles/usecases.htm">Use Cases
   and Function Points</A> by David Longstreet tries to show how to
   derive function points from use cases.
</UL>

<P>Finally, the following should be very helpful mapping points or
SLOCs (source lines of code) to effort:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="http://www.dacs.dtic.mil/techs/baselines/productivity.html">Software
   Engineering Baselines: Productivity</A> lists some common ranges
   of values for how SLOCs and Function Points map to effort in
   person months, as well as how Function Points map to SLOCS in
   different languages.
</UL>

<P><A NAME="planning"></A></P>

<H2>Task Planning</H2>

<P>Estimation tells you how long a project will take. A project plan
specifies how the work will be done, what the intermediate
deliverables are, how risk will be managed, and so on. There are many
good plans, but even more awful ones.</P>

<P>A project plan has to do more than just make sure everything gets
built. It has to do so in a way that <B>minimizes risk</B>. That
means frequent <EM>productive</EM> client involvement, early
identification of project-killers, and so on.</P>

<P>Some relevant readings are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Jalote, Chapter 6, presents the standard modern categorization
   of risk and common ways of dealing with them
   

   <LI><A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/documents/93.reports/93.tr.006.html">Taxonomy-Based
   Risk Identification</A> - a 20-page list of possible risk and how
   to use it to identify risks in a project

   Overview, with example, of a Staged Delivery Plan</A> -- staged
   delivery is one way to manage risk by making sure that something
   usable, albeit incomplete, is in place as rapidly as possible.
   
   <LI><A HREF="http://www.business-esolutions.com/islm.htm">An
   overview of many project plan models</A>, including staged
   delivery, evolutionary prototyping, etc.
</UL>

<P>Plans have lots of text, but a good chart is worth several
thousand words:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="http://studentweb.tulane.edu/~mtruill/dev-pert.html">PERT,
   CPM and GANTT</A> from "A Professional's Guide to Systems
   Analysis" by Martin E. Modell, a nice summary of the kinds of
   charts used in showing a work breakdown structure (WBS), with one
   bad point: no pictures.
   

   <LI><A HREF="http://gates.comm.virginia.edu/rrn2n/teaching/gantt.htm">Gantt
   and PERT charts</A> has screenshots from Microsoft Project -- also
   some links to project-related cartoons at the end
   

   <LI><A HREF="http://www.smartdraw.com/resources/examples/business/gantt.htm">Chart
   examples at SmartDraw</A> -- quite a few pretty pictures

<H3>Books</H3>

<P>The following texts are classics in the field. By no means is this
an exhaustive list of the "must-haves" for a software developer's
library.</P>

least one of them should go on your shelf for reference purposes, in
case some asks you about "function points."</P>

   <DD>Another standard text.
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Periodicals</H3>

<P>An important thing to learn is the difference between refereed
journals, magazines, and newsletters.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Refereed journals use a sometimes lengthy peer review process.
   Material is supposed to be new, a significant contribution to the
   field, and well-substantiated. The intended audience is very
   narrow. An article in a refereed journal will frequently be
   several years old by the time it finally gets printed. For this
   reason, such journals are usually called "archival."
   
   <LI>Magazines use a mix of editors and peer-commentary. Material
   is often meant to summarize or explain new but reasonably well
   understood concepts or practices to a wider audience. Turn-around
   time for articles is 6 months or less.
   
   <LI>Newsletters frequently print anything that is relevant, short,
   and non-libelous.

   <DT><A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigsoft/SEN/index.html">Software
   Engineering Notes</A>
   
   <DD>Thick newsletter published by the ACM. Don't trust everything

   <DD>A magazine. Good surveys, debates, case studies.
   
   <DT><A HREF="http://computer.org/tse/">IEEE Transactions on
   Software Engineering</A>
   
   <DD>This is a refereed journal. In my personal opinion, it's of
   little interest to most programmers. Your mileage may vary.
