<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Folks, we are awaiting our final guest for this evening, so I 
would like to welcome all of you to our online chat with J. Michael 
Straczynski, Creator and Executive Producer of Babylon 5, and coming 
soon, John Copeland, producer of Babylon 5! :D  Also joining us through 
equipment donated to us by Zathras (as opposed to ZAthras) is B5CnC. 
Through B5CnC, we are able to communicate directly with ANY CHARACTER 
on the show.  For instance, you can ask G'Kar whatever you want... Londo 
whatever you want... and through the power of The Great Machine, they 
will answer.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: and the Great Maker
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Want to ask Garibaldi what's up?  Londo what's next - G'Kar 
how's the eye?  Now is your chance!
 
<p>
<strong>OnlineHost</strong>: The auditorium consists of two major areas: the audience, 
where you are right now, and the stage, where the speakers appear. Text 
which you type onscreen shows only to those in your row, prefaced by the 
row number in parentheses, such as (2) if you are in row 2. To interact 
with the speaker, use the Interact icon on your screen.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: They're all waiting out there for your questions... And they 
will be answered in the character's own "voice" and mannerisms and 
perspective.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: So don't make Garibaldi mad.. please.
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC</strong>: Ask away!!!
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Our first question is for our own JMS...  From NotTheOne...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Did you plan the Sheridan and Delenn relationship or did it 
just come to mind while writing the episodes??
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: If you're not the One, why should I answer?  Besides, the 
One always denies he's the One.. No, that relationship was always going 
to be there for Delenn.   
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: I notice a trend already Joe... care to make a comment on 
Season 5 to bypass all of that tonight?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Okay: 1) no word yet on S5, and 2) videotapes are possible 
down the road, but not now.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Thanks Joe. :D
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Heres a question we've never had before.. from Danmaclea...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: I've noticed a lot more freedom in camera movement in scenes 
which combine CGI and live action.  Do you have some new hardware or do 
you match the CGI by hand.

<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Yeah, we've taken to putting targets on the bluescreen, 
which allows us to "staple" the CGI to the set, and we can thus move 
around a lot more.  John can probably address this better than I can 
since he just got here.

<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: We've also gotten a lot better at matching movement with live 
action and CGI.  Since we've started doing the FX in house we're trying 
stuff we were discouraged to do in the past.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: "We can't do it," we were told.  Well, actually, we can.  So 
now we do.
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: Sorry for being tardy, but my ISDN line was acting up.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: (John gets a working ISDN line, I have win 3.1 and only get 
carrier pigeons.)
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Our next question for JMS comes from Earl Prae...
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: I just threw my ISDN modem across the room, I'm on analog.
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: JMS, is there any chance Valen will return?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Return to the present?  No.  None. Valen lived out his life 
in the past.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: If you have a question for the B5 CHARACTERS, send in your 
questions now! :)
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: This question is for JMS from MediaRiot...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: JMS, in this weeks Newsweek, you take a swipe at Aaron 
Spelling and TV in general. Do you feel that most TV is a product of 
getting ad revenues up, that is, it's just made for marketing products 
to demo groups?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Unquestionably.  That's the bottom line for TV stations and 
advertisers .. even Majel once said to me, and openly to others, that 
they just sold ST as a way to sell soap during commercials, not that 
that's a bad thing per se, that's just how they think.  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Our next question is for G'Kar... from Tannis4U...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: G'Kar did you decide to issue the joint statment with Londo 
for the good of Sheridan's alliance or did Londo's speech actually move 
you to act?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- G'KAR</strong>: There comes a time when one must set aside old grudges. 
It is not a pleasant prospect, given Mollari, who I still consider 
something of a war criminal. But he is trying for repentence, and from 
the perspective of the Universe, I suppose this is a good thing.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: I agree with G'Kar.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: A personal question for Lt. Corwin from Karen Eve....
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: For Lt. Corwin:  If you could send any one personal message 
home, what would it be?
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: Hmmmm.  Corwin's got fans out there?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- CORWIN</strong>: Dear Mom, Dad and Uncle Sherman: Don't believe 
everything you hear about Babylon 5 (well, except the parts about 
Ivanova)  We're working hard to do the right thing, and sometimes that's 
hard to figure out, but we believe in the direction the captain's taking 
us, and we're sticking with it.  (Remind me when this is over to tell 
you about my date last year, it was...something I'll never forget.) 
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: Boy, that Corwin is an eloquent fellow.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: John: yeah, who writes his stuff?
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Question for JMS: I've been impressed with the richness and 
depth of all the 
characters...except Dr. Franklin, who still seems relatively 
one-dimensional to me.  Do you find that character harder to write, or 
is it just harder to fit him into everything?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: It's always a task to get a doctor into the action, and it's 
easier for other kinds of more action-oriented characters.  But that 
aside, he's a lot of fun to write.   
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: I didn't know the characters were going to be this chatty 
tonight, did you?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: They're always chatty, you just have to know how to listen.  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Question for Vir from TWandCrew... although this may be too 
personal...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Vir....are you going to marry Lyndisty??
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- VIR</strong>: Oh, my... Oh, this is embarrassing, I didn't expect 
this...it's so personal how did you find out?... Well, I...I 
think...perhaps yes, I mean...I know she has some...well, some problems, 
you see, and we have to work on those, but you know, she's a great 
kisser, and I can work around a lot that comes between us...not that 
anything would, I mean, let's not get graphic here...are we still on?  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: John, maybe you can answer this... from Johnldloa...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Howard Stern is a big fan of the show.  Any chance of having 
on or a cast member being on his radio show.  This is not a Stern joke 
question.  He always talks about how he loves the show.
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: We've actually talked with his show about having Claudia on, 
but he's never set anything definite with us.  We'd love to have someone 
on with Howard. 
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: For Marcus.. from Lightman2....
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: To Marcus- Why on Earth are you dancing around Ivanova? Go 
for it, man!
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- MARCUS</strong>: 
Dancing?  Go for it?  What are you TALKING about?  I have no 
idea what's going on anymore (entering private mode)  Are you crazy?  
She's standing right behind me, you're giving away the game. Don't ask 
about this in front of her, or I"ll have to give you a good 
thump...well, her first then you.)
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Londo... from MJButkus...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Londo, are you staying in contact with Centauri Prime,as of 
now (s4) or rather staying....away?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- LONDO</strong>: Well, you see, this is not an easy question, my friend.  The 
Regent seems to have things very well under control, you see, and 
I...well, I serve a greater purpose here, on Babylon 5, than I could 
serve back home just now.  So I am content to stay here.  It is frankly 
quieter.  And several more of the lower court have reported to me that 
the regent is acting most strangely lately, perhaps he has begun 
drinking, I hear of him wandering the palace late at night, telling 
people, "There is something important I must tell you..." then suddenly 
he stops, and walks off.  Very strange.  But he has always been a 
bit..odd, don't you think?  Go ahead...or as the humans say, GA
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: For John and Joe...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: for joe or john -- there have been a lot of rumours going 
around regarding the new 2 hour TNT films including which actors will be 
involved, which characters, etc. Anything you can divulge without giving 
anything away? And will Michael O'Hare be a part of it?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: The budget doesn't have enough in it to fly Michael out from 
the Coast and pay him the salary he deserves.  And in the story he was 
really a basic-level squadron pilot, and the story deals with the larger 
parties.  John?
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: The first film - I think is one of the best things that Joe 
has written and I think that you viewers will be surprised at how all of 
these characters from B5 fit into how the saga begins. The second film 
is a different type of story than you usually see on B5 and we think tha 
it will be a pleasant diversion for you viewers.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: The films also have Shari Belafonte, William Sanderson, 
Theodore Bickel, others.
(How informative, John.)
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: Rheiner Schone will be back.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Theodore Bikel played Rabbi Koslov I believe, correct?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Why not tell them that everyone dies, I mean really, we can 
talk about that.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Different part now.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: GA and save us from ourselves.
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: You mean the big funeral scene. I thought you wanted that to 
be a surprise.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: For Lennier... from Philberto.
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: to Lennier-  Are you ever going to tell Delenn how you feel?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- LENNIER</strong>: Because Delenn has stepped out for a moment, I will answer your 
question. though it does seem to me rather personal...my feelings for 
Delenn are only of the highest and noblest form.  It would be unseemly 
of me to confess any such feelings, or any variations on those feelings, 
to Delenn.  So no, that would not be appropriate.  

<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Lennier, if you can find Delenn.. I have a question for her.
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Delenn: what are your plans now that Minbar is settling down 
and the Gray Council is set?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- DELENN</strong>: I am here. I have a greater obligation now that must be pursued 
with the League Worlds and Earth...I could not pursue those goals for as 
long as my home was in turmoil, but now my people are on the path again, 
and I can devote my time to forging a new alliance, a new future, for 
all of our worlds.  (Can someone tell me why Marcus and Lennier are 
looking so embarrassed?  I just got here, and assume I missed much.)  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: A question for Joe and John from Managarm...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: We haven't heard anything about the telepaths Franklin helped 
hide from Psi-Corps. Is that going to change any time soon?
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: (BTW.. thank you Delenn)
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- BESTER</strong>: Bester here, breaking into the com line: I would like an answer 
to that as well.
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: You'll see something about the frozen teeps in the next 
couple of weeks
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Whoa whoa whoa! Whats going on here?
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Bester?
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Um.. ok...
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Captain: don't tell him, he'll find out soon enough.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: GA Bester.. what's on your mind?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: For the rest of us, yeah, you'll find out stuff very soon.
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: (no pun intended)
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Oh, for crying out loud, don't bring him into this, it was 
going so well.
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: Next question?  (Ignore him and he'll go away.)
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Ok.. quickly.. Londo from GotMilk96...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Londo...  Do you like the idea that you are turning into a 
nice guy?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- LONDO</strong>: My good fellow, I have *always* been a nice guy, whatever has 
G'Kar been telling you, hmmm?  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Here is a ratings question from Ranger1a for Joe and 
John....
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: How are the recent ratings for B5?  Do we have to worry about 
B5 being cancelled?
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: Our ratings have been up all across the board this season.  
But the future is never assured. 
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: The ratings are good; solid.  The renewal depends on 
available station berths, primarily. 
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Paging Zack...  From LdyRangrB....
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Zack??  are you going to persue a relationship with Lyta?? you 
make a good couple..or are you just going to stick to pizza?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- ZACK</strong>: Yeah, well...Lyta...it ain't like I haven't thought about it, 
y'know...but she's a teep, how do you...make a move on someone who knows 
what you're going to do before you do it?  Y'know the old "arm around 
the shoulders at the scary part of the movie" bit?  C'mon, the ladies 
hardly fall for that NOW... with a teep, she'd break my arm.  And I'd 
miss, which would be really embarrassing.  Not that... I'd mind trying, 
of course...it's a challenge.  I like challenges.  Especially red-haired 
ones. 
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Here is a GREAT question from Guru4Win9...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Delenn said that the center of the new grey council was for 
the 'one to come'. That was what Zathras called Sheridan. Are they both 
references to the same person ?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- DELENN</strong>: How do you know what happened in the Grey Council?  
Well, that aside...and I must look... further into our security...the 
place set aside might be for someone like John, yes.  But.. only time 
will determine that.  The universe knows what it is doing.  
 
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Heres an industry question for you guys from GSSFC...
 
<strong>Question</strong>: JMS... From a drooling fan, of course... From your own 
feedback in the 'biz', what do you see as being the future in terms of 
other shows? Do you think there will be attempts to do a B5-type arc 
story from non-affiliated sources?
 
<p>
<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: I think that others are watching us, and we know that there 
are other arc-shows... that are in the works, or have started to change 
toward arcs; it's been a gentle... revolution, and over time I think 
more will go this way.  
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: It will be interesting to see what happens.  In the wake of 
"Dark Skies" not working, others may be cautious in the near term. 
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: We have another question for Vir from Hardestad...
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Vir, what were you writing when woke up from your nightmare?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- VIR</strong>: I was writing out the Ambassador's shopping list for the day, 
it's nothing terribly interesting... fresh spoo, hot jala (5 bottles), 
ladies undergarmen...I mean, clothing...
and some small amount of alcoholic beverages, nothing much to speak of.  
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Ok, it's time for a moment of truth here.  Mr. Garibaldi... a 
question from BJSDebora.
 
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Garibaldi--have you wondered at all about the changes in your 
own thinking and attitudes?  Are you aware that you are feeling and 
doing things not like you?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- GARIBALDI</strong>: Look, we all go through changes.  It happens.  It's part of 
life.  Yeah, I think I've changed... haven't you?  To continue a 
relationship like we have here you have to trust that the other guy's 
doing the right thing.  I ain't convinced.  I see things a little 
clearer now, that's all... I'm on my own, but y'know, I always have 
been.  It's nothing new.  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Folks, I'm going to try and keep the comm systems open until 
the top of the hour.   I'll keep the channel open as long as I can. :)

<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: From WandaJH.. for JMS and John.

<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Joe: You've indicated that you will take ideas which resonate 
with a particular actor and weave them into the storyline.  Was the 
civil war on Minbar always in the story or is it a detail that you added 
after you learned of Mira's personal ordeal?

<strong>Jms at B5</strong>: This is a case where I knew there would have to be conflict 
and division on Minbar...but the specific shapes of that conflict, the 
specific icivil war elements, I chose in order to tie into her own 
background, knowing I'd get truth behind her eyes during those scenes.  
It's manipulative, but it's in a worthy cause.  

<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: From Sudibelle, for my favorite telepath... Lyta.

<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Lyta, did you really explore all the options before going 
along with Bester?  Didn't the station give you any kind of support?
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- LYTA</strong>: I don't know...maybe I should have looked into it more, but I 
was *tired*.... and even though I know the folks who run this place like 
me, there's just so much they can do.... even if they did let me stay in 
the larger quarters (and that wasn't really the issue)... I had to start 
working again, had to be a commercial teep again, and what that requires 
is not theirs to give.  I had to think in the long term.  No, it wasn't 
something I wanted to do but I just didn't see any other way around it.  
I'm just being sure to stay healthy.  
 
<p>
<strong>B5 Online</strong>: Well folks, it seems the comm system is starting to 
experience some problems, and the crew needs to get ready for another 
Voice of the Resistance broadcast. I want to thank Joe, John and the B5 
crew for participating through us with the help of Draal and The Great 
Machine!  Thanks guys!
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- BESTER</strong>: Nobody ever has questions for me.
 
<p>
<strong>PigDog13</strong>: Thanks, it was a pleasure being here.
 
<p>
<strong>B5CnC -- SHERIDAN</strong>: Sheridan to AOL: Thanks for having us.
