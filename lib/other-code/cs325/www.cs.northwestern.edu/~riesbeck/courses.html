<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>NOTICE OF CHANGES</H1>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>IN COURSE SCHEDULE</H1>

</P>

<P>Due to the well-publicized budget crunch at UNC, the Fall 1990
graduate computer science course schedule has undergone some changes.
The following corrections take place immediately :</P>

<DL>
   <DT>Replacing COMP 122 (ALGORITHMS AND ANALYSIS):<BR>
   
   COMP 123 ALGORITHMS AND PSYCHOANALYSIS
   
   <DD>Investigation into the motives of famous algorithm designers.
   Anal retentive behavior among sort developers. Gardening habits of
   Prim, Kruskal, Adel'son-Vel'skii, and Landis. Examples of
   Dijkstra's lecture tour routes. Karp's early career as a brush
   salesman. Scavenger hunt successes of Boyer and Moore, with
   discussion of recent losses to some new guy.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: <EM>The Psychology of Computer Programming</EM>,
   Weinberg.
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 171 (NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING):<BR>
   
   COMP 175 SUPERNATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
   
   <DD>Tools and techniques in computer analysis of psychic
   communication. Syntactic and semantic models of telepathy.
   Technical considerations for power outages, especially within the
   context of the seance. Implications of "ghosts in the machine".
   Investigation of various interface strategies, including tarot
   card readers, crystal trackballs, and ouija mousepads.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: Time-Life <EM>Mysteries of the Unknown</EM>.
   Students will be required to READ THE BOOK.
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 213 (FILES AND DATABASES):<BR>
   
   COMP 215 FILES NAND DATABASES
   
   <DD>Due to budgetary limitations, the subject matter for this
   course will be necessarily abridged. We might cover files; we
   might not. Ditto for databases. But we certainly won't cover both.
   As a matter of fact, we might not cover anything! Prerequisite:
   COMP 216 (Digital Logic Techniques), just to figure out your
   options.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: Maybe.
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 217 (INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING
   LANGUAGES):<BR>
   
   COMP 218 INTRODUCTION IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
   
   <DD>Investigation of techniques (in various programming paradigms)
   of creating the "Hello World" program. Generalization to other
   useless programs. Introduction to NP-easy problems.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: <EM>I Didn't Know You Could Do That With A
   Computer!</EM>
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 233 (DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION):<BR>
   
   COMP 235 DISCREET EVENT SIMULATION
   
   <DD>Virtual realization of scenarios that most of us geeks will
   never experience in real-life. Digitization of glossy pictures.
   Redesign of WalkThru, and possible renaming of same. Techniques
   for interfacing with various 1-900 numbers. Course project
   required; may need to be evaluated several times by
   instructor.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: It's a secret.
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 238 (RASTER GRAPHICS):<BR>
   
   COMP 239 RASTA GRAPHICS
   
   <DD>Hey mon. Let me tell you, mon, you'll be likin' this course.
   We be jammin' to many important concepts, mon. Rendering
   dreadlocks, mon. Synchronization with MIDI sources of reggae, mon.
   Debugging with voodoo, mon. You get the picture; get it, mon, "get
   the picture"? I be seeing you, mon. Take the course.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: None, but bring your Marley and Tosh cassettes.
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 290-1 (EXPERT SYSTEMS):<BR>
   
   COMP 290-3 NOVICE SYSTEMS
   
   <DD>Design, implementation, and testing of systems that simulate
   computer novices. Observation and analysis of real novices in Mac
   Lab. Course project required; end-of-semester demonstration
   constitutes substantial portion of grade. "Optimal" NS's will
   behave erratically at this demo: complaining, crying, copying
   other students' disks, failing to do rudimen- tary documentation,
   and bothering COMP 4 and 14 TA's to distraction. Extra credit
   given for creative program generation.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: <EM>Pascal</EM>, Koffman, but students are not
   allowed to refer to it at any time.
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 290-2 (HIGHLY PARALLEL PROGRAMMING):<BR>
   
   COMP 290-4 HIGHLY PERPENDICULAR PROGRAMMING
   
   <DD>Design of multiprocessor machines, with the emphasis being on
   non-cooperation among the nodes. Geometric theorem-proving by
   computer, with varying approaches to internal representation of
   compass and straightedge. Introduction to truly orthogonal
   programming constructs.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: Who'd write a text on this?
   
   <DT>&nbsp;
   
   <DT>Replacing COMP 291 (PROFESSIONAL WRITING IN COMPUTER
   SCIENCE):<BR>
   
   COMP 292 CONFESSIONAL WRITING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
   
   <DD>This course further emphasizes UNC's strong commitment to
   building a real sense of ethics in its students. If you're bound
   and determined to cheat on the job, this course will provide you
   with the writing skills to confess about it later. Through
   successive drafts, students refine their public catharsis to a
   razor-sharpness that any politician would find enviable. Special
   guest lecturers: Jimmy Swaggart, Robert Morris, Jr.<BR>
   
   REQUIRED TEXT: None -- the STUDENTS write the book.
