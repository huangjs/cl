<h1>What is a thesis defense?</h1>

<p>A thesis defense has two parts: a thesis and a defense.
The second mistake many students make is not knowing what their thesis
is.  The third mistake is not knowing how to defend it.  (The first mistake
is described later.)</p>

<h2>What is a thesis?</h2>

<p><font color=red>Your thesis is not your dissertation.  Neither is it a one-liner
about what you are doing.</font>  Your thesis is "a position or proposition
that a person (as a candidate for scholastic honors) advances
and offers to maintain by argument." [Webster's 7th New Collegiate
Dictionary]  "I looked at how people play chess" is not a thesis; "people
adapt memories of old games to play new games" is.  A thesis has to 
<b>claim</b> 
something.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of claims. Most of the work around here is either design (you built an AI program or learning tool) or modelling (you have a theory of how something works). Such work usually supports one of the following kinds of claims:</p>

<ul>
<li>X is a <b>feasible</b> way to do Y

<li>X is a <b>better</b> way to do Y

<li>doing Y <b>requires</b> X

<li><b>people</b> use X to do Y
</ul>

<p>where "X" is your model of memory, learning algorithm, authoring tool, learning environment, etc., and "Y" is a task or goal, such as understanding text, learning algebra, writing programs to teach algebra, etc.</p>

<p> Besides being a proposition, a thesis has to have another property: it
must say something <b>new</b>. 
"Understanding natural language requires context"
is not a thesis (except maybe in a linguistics department).
"Algorithm X is a feasible mechanism for understanding anaphoric references in newspaper text" is. So is
"context is not required for visual understanding." </p>

<h2>What is a defense?</h2>

<p>A defense presents evidence for a thesis.  What kind of evidence is
appropriate depends on what kind of thesis is being defended. There are very different defenses for each of the kinds of claims given above.</p>

<h3>Thesis: X is a <b>feasible</b> way to do Y</h3>

 <p>    One defense for this kind of claim is
an analysis of the complexity, or completeness, or whatever, 
of the theoretical algorithm.  In AI, the more common defense
is based on empirical results
from running a program.  A good defense here means more than one example,
and answers to questions such as the following.
What are the capabilities and limits of your program?  How often do
the things that your program does come up in the real world?  What's involved
in extending it?  If it's easy to extend, why haven't you?
If your program is
a piece of a larger system, how realistic are your assumptions about
input and output?</p>

<p>Analogous questions arise in the design of learning environments. You should
be able to argue that your environment can support learning in more than one specific arena, and what would be involved in implementing it elsewhere. You should be clear and specific about when it would not be a good approach. </p>

<h3>Thesis: X is a <b>better</b> way to do Y</h3>

<p>The same kind of defense applies here as in the previous case, but
now serious comparisons with previous systems are required.  In AI, can your
program do the same examples the previous programs did, or can you make
them do yours?  Can you prove they couldn't do your examples? If you
claim to be more efficient, what are you measuring?</p>

<p>In the learning sciences, what do you mean by "better" and how are you measuring it? Are you sure the other approaches wouldn't work just as well if they had you spending all that time on them?</p>

<h3>Thesis: doing Y <b>requires</b> X</h3>

<p>This is usually defended by a logical argument.  It is usually
very tough to do, even if the argument doesn't have to be formalized.</p>

<h3>Thesis: <b>people</b> use X to do Y</h3>

<p> Many students in AI make the mistake of picking a cognitive modelling thesis to defend, thinking that something that looks cognitively plausible is therefore OK.
Defending a cognitive model requires
serious experimental evidence.  Selected excerpts from
protocols and surveys of your officemates are not psychological evidence,
no matter how much they might have inspired your work.</p>


<h2>I have lots of theses in my dissertation.  Which one should I pick
for my defense?</h2>

<p>Collecting enough evidence to really defend a thesis is hard.  If you think you
have a lot of theses, you probably just have a bunch of undefended
claims.  One good thesis, or two so-so theses, with adequate description
and defense, is more than enough to fill up a dissertation.</p>

<h2>I have the opposite problem. I don't think I have any thesis by
these standards.</h2>

<p>Highly unlikely.  If you're bright, educated, and have worked hard 
on a topic for more than a year, you must have learned something no
one else knew before.  </p>

<p><font color=red>The first mistake that AI students make is to think
that a thesis has to be grander than the theory of relativity.</font>  A thesis
should be new and interesting, but it doesn't have to change the 
foundations of all we believe and hold dear.  </p>

<h2>How do I pick my thesis to avoid these problems?</h2>

<p>There's a mistaken view of thesis research that it starts with
a thesis and then an investigation to prove or disprove the thesis. That only happens in fields that have matured to "filling in the blanks," and even then it only happens with advisors who like to stick to tried and true questions. </p>

<p>In young fields such as AI and the learning sciences, you'll never start with a claim. Very few of you will even get to start with a question! You start by exploring one or more problems in some task domain. You'll start with some initial ideas, naive or clever, and push them hard for a year
or so.  Then, you need to stop and think about what you've
done and what you've learned.  Among your accomplishments and
experience, there will be several good candidate theses.  Pick one.  Test
it out on your advisor and other faculty members.  
Test it out on other students.  Watch out for the following flaws:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes half an hour or more for anyone to understand what your claim is. If that happens more than once, you don't know what your claim is yet.

<li>Everyone thinks the claim is obvious. Maybe your claim is so general that it's vacuous. Can you formulate the opposite claim? Does anyone believe it could be true when you do?  

<li>No one think the claim matters. Maybe your claim is too specific. Who cares if you wrote a program and that program needs a particular data structure?
</ul>

<p>Once you refined your claim, now you can determine
what kind of defense is appropriate for it and what more you need to
do.  This is where the psychologically hard part comes, 
because to create a defense
for your thesis, you're going to have to attack it harder than anyone
else.  What happens if the thesis fails?  Negate it and defend that!
In a year or so of focussed research, you should be ready for a 
real thesis defense.</p>

<p>See how easy it is, once you know how?</p>
