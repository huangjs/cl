<P>Chris Riesbeck is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at Northwestern University. He received his Ph.D. in
Computer Science from Stanford University in 1974. His dissertation
was on natural language understanding.</P>

<P>He has done research on case-based reasoning, memory-based
language understanding, and intelligent interfaces for knowledge
acquistion and teaching. His current research is concerned with
making interactive learning environments as easy to author as
textbooks.</P>

Center for Human Information Processing at the University of
California in San Diego, and was a research scientist in computer
science at Yale University for 15 years.</P>

<H2>What is AI?</H2>

<p>Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aartificial+intelligence">"define:artificial intelligence"</a>
or visit <a href="http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/overview.html#definition">AAAI's site</a>, and
you'll see lots of definitions, mostly oriented around the notion of computers
doing things that require intelligence.</p>

<p>These definitions are clearly inadequate. For one thing, there are tasks
that we think require intelligence when humans do them, that are not
AI tasks, e.g., calculating complex sums. 
Conversely, there are tasks we don't think require intelligence when
humans do them, that are AI tasks, e.g., computer vision. And, of course,
as has been pointed out for decades, there are tasks that were AI only until
we figured out how to get a computer to do them, e.g., optical character 
recognition.</p>

<p>So here's the true definition of AI, the one that gets at the heart
of what we do and why.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; width:80%;border-style:outset;border-width:4px">Artificial Intelligence is the search for the
answer to the fundamental question: Why are computers so stupid?
</p>

<p>It's left as an exercise for the intelligent reader as to
why this definition addresses the three weaknesses listed above.</p>

<H2>What is a Thesis Defense?</H2>

<p>The AI and Learning Sciences groups at Yale and Northwestern
take the terms "thesis" and "defense" pretty seriously. 
I wrote <a href="defense.html">What is a Thesis Defense?</a> many years ago for 
the AI grad students at Yale. I've updated it a bit to relate it to the 
Learning Sciences. It's a personal statement.</p>

<H2>Qual Programming Questions</H2>

used to require answers in Lisp, but in the past few years, anything
suitable is allowed.</P>
