<H1>INDIE: An Authoring Tool for Goal-Based Scenarios</H1>

<P>
Indie is an authoring tool that enables non-programmers to create
multimedia educational software.  Specifically, Indie lets you build
<A HREF="http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-226-pg.html">Goal
Based Scenarios</A> of the "investigate and decide" type.  In an
"investigate and decide" GBS, the user's task is to conduct an
investigation (running laboratory tests, conducting interviews, etc.)
and make a decision based on the results of the investigation.</P>

<P>Indie was developed at
<b>The Institute for the Learning
Sciences</b> (ILS).  Most past development on Indie was done by graduate
students Wolff Dobson and
Seth Tisue, and staff programmer
Steve Silverstein.
Other programmers who have contributed code to Indie include Brendon
Towle, Brian Davies, and Joe Herman.</P>

<P>Indie was developed using <A
HREF="http://www.digitool.com/">Macintosh Common Lisp</A>.</P>

<P>A web-based version of <b>Indie</b> now exists. This is a complete
rewrite, with an emphasis on simplicity and portability, rather
than rich multimedia. The core goal-based scenario structure remains
the same. For more information, contact 
<a href="mailto:c-riesbeck@northwestern.edu">Chris Riesbeck</a>.</P>

<P>
Two Indie applications built at ILS were used by
students in classes at Northwestern University: <CITE>Nutrition
Clinician</CITE> and <CITE>Is it a Rembrandt?</CITE>.  Masters students
using Indie have also
built a number of working prototypes in domains ranging from astronomy
and ecology to business training and auto repair.</P>

HREF="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~wolff/iui98/iui98.html">"Authorable Critiquing for Intelligent
Educational Systems"</A> (presented at Intelligent User Interfaces
'98).  This describes the workings of our current critiquing mechanism,
as well as a discussion of why our old critiquer was such a flop.

HREF="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~wolff/chi98/chi98.html">"Tools For Incremental Development of
Educational Software Interfaces"</A> (presented at Computer-Human
Interaction '98).  This describes, roughly, how our current interface
builder works.  It also talks about why our old interface builder was
such a flop.
