<A HREF="triggers.html">Triggers</A> are fired by events. Though
there's plenty to say about events, but let's just describe some of
the events that are available:

<UL>

<LI>No Rules Fired: If a given rule submission takes place and no
rules fire, then you might need to flag that.  This event has one
argument, the argument that no rules were fired upon.  So, if you
submitted "The volcano will explode" with the correct evidence, no
rules fire and you get back a No Rules Fired event with the argument
"The volcano will explode."  To make a trigger take place when no
rules are fired about a particular argument:

<OL>
<LI>Open the triggers menu. Create a new trigger. 
<LI>Choose "Create" for which event to fire upon. 
<LI>From the list of event types, choose CRITIQUE-EVENT.
<LI>Choose :no-rules-fired from the pulldown menu.
<LI>Select the appropriate argument that you'd like to have happen.
<LI>Close the editor that then appears. 
<LI>Hook up the appropriate answer here. I suggest a "You win!"
sort of notice.  If you are only submitting one hypothesis per scenario,
you might here go to the wrap-up screen.
</OL>

<LI>Scenario Chosen: This event takes place after a scenario has been
chosen, either by a Choose Scenario model action, or by a Go To Next
Scenario model action.  For more on this event, see <A
HREF="preferences.html">Preferences</A> and Go To Next Scenario model
action.</I>

<LI>Rule Fired: During critiquing, lots of rules fire.  Each rule fired
has exactly one argument, the particular rule that fired.

<LI>(...and many other event types!)
