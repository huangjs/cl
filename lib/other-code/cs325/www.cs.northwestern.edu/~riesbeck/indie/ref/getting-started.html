You should probably begin by "storyboarding" the interface for your
GBS on paper. Figure out how many different screens there are. Draw
rough layouts for the screens on paper.  Think about how the user will
get from one screen to the other, what common elements there are
between screens, and how these common elements can be arranged into
"layers" -- remember, a layer is a group of interface objects that get
shown and hidden together. Will your GBS have multiple windows, or
will everything be shown in one window? (Most ILS GBS's make no or
only very limited use of multiple windows.)
