<HR><H2><A NAME="starting">Getting started</A></H2>

<H3>Create a window</H3>

Using the Interface menu, switch to Design Interface mode.  Create a
window (using Menu<I>Interface-Make New Window</I>, then
click on Menu <I>Interface-Edit Current Window</I>, click
there on <I>Edit Window</I> and check the Box <I>Show
on Startup</I>)

<H3>Define your hosts</H3>

Hosts are the directories (paths) on your Computer, where you'll put
your resources like, videos, audios, pictures, cursors, etc. Make a
logical structure -- it'll help you later on.

<HR><H2>How to make an Ask System</H2>

<H3>What is an AskSystem?</H3>

An AskSystem is a linked structure of question and answers -- for each
answer you can have some points, which can appear in a notebook.

<P>The question, answers and points can appear anywhere on a screen,
therefore you use viewers.

<P>To "browse" the AskSystem you need start levels -- these start
levels are usually defined by the current task you have to do (i.e. a
specific test, a interview to a certain topic, etc.).

<P>These start levels are named Topics. These topics define the
questions which should appear first for the given task.

<P>For example, if you go the first time to a specific test, you want
the user to see 4 questions in your AskSystem. These 4 questions are
defined as the topic.

<H3>What do you need for an Ask System?</H3>

<DL>

<DT>Questions<DD>That's what you ask

<DT>Answers<DD>That's the answer texts or movie clips

<DT>Points<DD>That's the points, which are added to your notebook

</DL>

There are two kinds of points: fact points and result points -- fact
points are scenario independent points, meaning coming from the expert
AskSystem, result points are scenario specific points, like only valid
for one picture within Rembrandt. We should keep the distinction said
Seth, even if I don't know any effect.)

<P>They have to use some kind of intermediary to finally appear on the
screen -- why, I don't know beside for Answers (later about that) --
these intermediary are:

<DL>
<DT>Question List<DD>for Questions
<DT>Speaker<DD>for Answer
<DT>Evidence List<DD>for Points
</DL>

To bring them to the screen you now need a viewer:

<DL>
<DT>Question Viewer<DD>for Question List
<DT>Answer Viewer<DD>for Speaker
<DT>Evidence Viewer<DD>for Evidence List
</DL>

The Answer Viewer is the only viewer which can have more than one of
these intermediaries (here: speaker) -- the other viewers have a
one-to-one-relationship to their lists. The purpose is, that the name
of the speaker (should be the real name) can appear on a nameplate
below the answer viewer.

<H3>How to do it?</H3>

It could be different depending on how far you are in your design -- if
you have your AskSystem ready structured or if you only know all your
questions or if you only know the interface.

<P>I only describe the case, that you have your entire AskSystem ready
structured (the other cases could only differ by another order and the
use of dummies).

<P>I would do it like this:

<P>Create a question, write in the question text (If you already know
the question lists, meaning the location where the questions will
appear, define them now, otherwise do it later, like described
below). Now double click on answer (creates one), create (or
choose=find) the speaker, click on text/movie/picture. If you have
your videos etc. already logged, type in the text box the file name
and the synopsis -- if you like (and have it ready), you can already
choose the actual file below the text box. Now click on
Followups/Points/Next Answer and type in your points -- each point,
which should be a separate piece of evidence has to get it's own
point.

<P>After you finished the input of all questions and answers, you have
to structure them. Therefore I would start with creating a topic and
asign (find) the first question for this topic. Then double click on
this question, define a question list for it, double click on answer,
click on Followups/Points/Next Answer and define (find) the followup
questions and define the question list for each. Take care, that the
question list should be the same as for the topic questions.  (This is
only valid, if you have only one AskSystem on the screen at the same
time. If you have more the one AskSystem, i.e. the expert AskSystem
and an interview in the simulation, you define on the topic level all
the question which should appear in this topic and assign them to two
different question lists. Be careful with the followups -- an example:
If you have a question in the interview, which should have followups
in the interview and changes the expert AskSystem that's the common
case], you need to have followups for the interview w/ the question
list of the interview questions and followups for the experts w/ the
question list of the expert questions.)

<P>If applicable, define in each followup question the next level of
followup questions following the same procedure. Do this until you
have defined the entire AskSystem for this topic. Now go to the next
topic and start over. It doesn't matter if you had defined a question
as a topic or followup question before -- you can still use them here
again as topic or followup question.

<P>Finally you drag the question, answer and evidence viewer from the
palette (the window w/ the funny pictures) onto your window and define
the question list, speakers and evidence lists: double click on the
viewer, goto <I>Edit xxx Viewer</I>. (If you first created the interface --
this would be your first step and not the last like here.)

<P>One hint: In the Question Viewer, you can change the kind of
buttons you want to have in the AskSystem -- it seems to me, that the
MacButton is not able to wrap text!! Maybe it's a global Mac property,
maybe it's a bug.

<P>Now you have to call (trigger) the topic.  A trigger is activated
by an event. An event could be for example the clicking of a button or
the start of the GBS. An event like clicking of a button needs (haha)
a button on the screen. Drag one over from the palette, double click
on it, click on <I>Edit trigger</I>, open the topics section and choose
(find) under <I>Then activate these topics...</I> the topic you want to be
called. After clicking on the button later on, you will see in your
question viewer the questions of this topic.

<HR><H2>Windows &amp; layers</H2>

The windows/layers concept is quite easy: You usually have one main
window which appears at startup (see <A HREF="#starting">Getting
started</A>). Now imagine the window as a overhead projector, on this
overhead projector you place your transparencies -- these
transparencies are your layers. You see everything of the uppermost
layer but only that part of the lower layers which are not covered by
objects on the upper layers. You can show layers, meaning put them on
top or hide them, meaning remove them (if you show them again
afterwards they are on top now). On a layer you can have several
objects (items). They work the same way like the layers on a window:
You see everything of the upper most object but only that part of the
lower objects which are not covered by an upper object. The order of
the objects on a layer is fixed for the user -- you cannot change it
later by an user action (certainly it's always changeable by you in
design mode).

<H3>How to make layers/windows and assign objects?</H3>

The best way to work with layers and windows is the window
<I>Window/Layer Controller</I>, which you can activate from the
Interface menu. Open it and there you can go to the windows and the
layers window to create new windows or layers or click directly on
existing windows/layers to edit their properties.

<P>I assume that you have one window, so click on edit layers, in the
new window click on create layer, then give it a name and choose
(find) the window it should appear on. Now choose (find) the objects
(items) which should appear on the layer. To bring them in the right
order, use the <I>Move up/Move Down</I> Buttons -- but be attention,
the list is reversed to the appearance: the top item in the list is
the lowest object on the layer and vice versa!  Conceptually, the
items appear in the order that they will be put onto the "overhead
projector".

<P>Another way to put objects on a layer is to select them and then on
the Interface menu, choose either <I>Add to layer...</I> to add them
to an existing layer, or <I>Add to new layer...</I> to create a new
layer and add them to it.

<H3>How to show and hide layers</H3>

You show or hide layers usually with triggers.

<P>Another way is the pseudo grouping of layers. In the same window
where you define the objects on a layer, you can define which layers
should appear together (like a group) or should exclude each other
(like a switch). For example: you have a background layer and a two
button layer. Everytime you activate button layer A you want to have
the background layer as well, and you don't want to have button layer
B. To do this, add in the properties of button layer A under <I>Layer
it shows also</I>, the backgroud layer and under <I>Windows/layers it
hides</I> button layer B. But attention again: This is not a real
group and not a real switch -- the links go only one way. For example
if you show the background layer, button layer A is not automatically
shown, therefore you have to add button layer A to the properties of
background layer as well. And if you show button layer B, button layer
A is not automatically hidden, therefore you have to add button layer
A to the properties of button layer B as well. But even now, it's not
a real group or switch. Because if both layers, background layer and
button layer A, are shown it's still possible to hide one of them and
the other is still there and it's still possible to have none of
button layer A and button layer B on the screen. ... but it's still a
useful property.

<P>Some of this properties work also between windows and layers.

<H3>Avoid infinite loops of layers</H3>

Last time I said something about layers, that can give the impression,
that you should let the layers show each other or hide each other and
not only in one direction (this was in the very confusing part of the
pseudo grouping of layers) -- but this is wrong.

<P>If you get a "Stack Overflow Error", the likeliest cause is that
you created an infinite loop in your layer structure, e.g. layer A is
on layer B's "show also" list and layer B is on layer A's "show also"
list.  If you accidentally do this, the Indie developers can help you
find the loop and remove it.

<P>A good rule of thumb to help you avoid this is: a layer should
always require its background, but never vice versa.

<P>Best hint of me: Just imagine the shown/hide functionality is like
an internal trigger.

<H3>Layer Q & A</H3>

Q: There is this problem of having a layer shown, then you show
another layer which covers the first one -- now you want to see the
old first again, but this seems not to work, although the
windows/layer controller tells you that it's there.

<P>A: It's quite easy -- you have to realize, that the show/hide layer
command don't actually shows/hides the layer.  Imagine the layers as
slides on a overhead. Hide layer takes the "slide" from the overhead
and show layer puts the "slide" on top of all other "slides".  So --
if you haven't removed (hidden) the layer, you can not put it on top
(see it again).  Solution: Every time you don't need a layer, hide it
-- this is a good idea anyway because it will improve performance.

<P>Q: But, you say -- what should I do, if there is a layer, for
example with some button, which has a changing background -- first
background A, now I show background B - background B now covers my
buttons.

<P>A: First -- the easy, but not nice way: Let the trigger which shows
B hide the Button layer and as a next trigger show the Buttons again.
The better way is: avoid this situation -- one possibility could be,
to cut the background into pieces and avoid the part of the buttons or
integrate some of the background in the button layer.

<HR><H2>Buttons and pictures</H2>

Hopefully almost intuitively clear.

<P>Important is the TwoPict Button: You should define at a minimum the
pressed and the non pressed button -- otherwise it will look bad. Two
Pict buttons have 3 properties: <I>Sticky</I>, <I>Pressed on
Startup</I> and <I>Is a Checkbox</I>.  Sticky means it's a onetime
switch -- once you pressed it, it will stay down. <I>Is a Checkbox</I>
is a real switch, after pressing it stays down, if you click again on
it, it pops up again (that doesn't has anything to do with its
functionality). <I>Pressed on Startup</I> should be clear -- it can be
combined with the two others. A combination of <I>Sticky</I> and <I>Is
a Checkbox</I> is possible but shouldn't be because it doesn't make
any sense.

<H3>Radio buttons</H3>

If you have Radio Buttons or Option Buttons, only one of them can be
pressed at the same time (like Multiple Choice w/ only one right
answer).

<P>To create something like this you need TwoPict Buttons. In their
properties you have to give all relevant buttons in the field <I>Radio
Group</I> an identical group name and activate the property
<I>Sticky</I>. If you now click on one button, it will go down, if you
click on another button, that will go down and the first one will pop
up.

<H3>Remote pressed radio buttons</H3>

To have (radio) button pushed down without clicking on it, you need a
special trigger (why do I want to do it? -- see following
application).  If you have now an event (like clicking another button
outside the radio group), choose <I>Edit trigger</I> and choose
<I>Model Action</I> (what exactly a model action is -- I cannot
say. For me it's a conglomeration of actions with don't fit under
another category -- but most probably there is a real reason behind
it).  (NOTE: Model actions were named that way because the original
idea was that none of them would affect the interface directly --
instead, they would only affect objects in your "world model", i.e.,
tests, results, questions, answers, etc.  But as Indie evolved we
wound up creating "model actions" that really just do stuff in the
interface.  Eventually we'll separate them out into "model actions"
and "interface actions". -- Seth)

<P>Now you create a model action named <I>Pop Button Model Action</I>,
choose (find) the button in your radio group you want to have pushed
and after that you click on the option <I>... but keep this one
pushed</I> (insane!).

<P>Okay -- why should I want to push down a button in a radio button
group remotely?

<P>Imagine you have a notebook with different tabs (sections in
notebook).  You can switch between the notebook section by clicking on
the tabs.  How to do that? the different sections are different
evidence viewers lying on different layers each. The tabs are radio
buttons. Their trigger, show the respective notebook section layer,
which has as property hide all other layers with notebook sections.

<P>If these section are now specific to something in the simulation
and you want the notebook change automatically to the section you are
in, you have to do following: The event, which brings you to the part
of the simulation should also show the respective notebook layer and
should push the respective button in the radio button group down.

<HR><H2>Building a turnkey application</H2>

I know, that right now, almost nobodyq cares, but for me the nicest
way to deliver an Indie GBS on a CD-ROM is, if you only can see the
Indie-Icon on the CD ROM, double click on it and ... voila.

<P>To do this: launch the Indie Runtime application (don't ask me, why
it's not possible from the Tool), load your GBS, and then choose
<I>Save GBS as Application</I> on the File menu.  Before doing this
though, in the Tool, be sure that you save it with the right hosts for
the CD ROM.  It's best to use relative paths in your hosts.  It's also
best to use relative window positioning, otherwise you will have
problems on other machines with a different screen size. The next
steps are easy -- burn onto the CD Rom the new application you just
made; at the same (root) level save the 3 pcml-xxx-4.1 files and the
hosts with your resources. In Toast you can double click on the files
and folder and decide, if they should be invisible. If you do this for
all but the application, you'll have a nice clean distribution CD ROM
(although that's not very practical if you want to use it as a backup
medium).

<P>Oh yeah -- and to avoid an error message either send the logfiles
to the user's Preferences folder in their System Folder (there is a
setting for this in the GBS Preferences object) or turn off logging,
therefore you have to create a text file named "INDIE-prefs".  Put it
in the same directory as the application.  Put the following line of
text in it:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>(setf ccl::*logging-p* nil)</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
