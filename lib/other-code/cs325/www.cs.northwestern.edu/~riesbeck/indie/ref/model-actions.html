Model actions are ways you can interact with the model, like the
experiment module or critiquer.  To make a model action happen, you
put it in a <A HREF="triggers.html">trigger</A>.

There are many model actions, but they're not all documented yet:

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="ma-next-scenario.html">Go To Next Scenario</A>

<LI><A HREF="cursors.html">Cursors</A>.  Though these aren't exactly "model"
actions, as such, they got stuck here.  Sorry.

</UL>
