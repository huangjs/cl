<H1>Triggers</H1>

Triggers are fired by <A HREF="events.html">events</A>.  You can use
triggers to show and hide layers and windows, show answers, activate
topics, and perform <A HREF="model-actions.html">model actions</A>.

<H2>One-Time Triggers</H2>

One-time triggers fire exactly once per time you've called &quot;Start
GBS&quot;.  You could use them for guide video or introductions to
screens, or annoying remediation you'd like only to see once.

<H2>Next Triggers</H2>

Next-triggers are triggers that are run after the current trigger
fires, so if Trigger A has Trigger B in its next-trigger slot, Trigger
B will fire any time Trigger A fires, no matter what event is listed
in Trigger B.

<P>If Trigger A is a one-time trigger and Trigger B is an every-time
trigger, Trigger A will fire once but <I>trigger B will fire any time
Trigger A might have fired, whether A fired at all</I>! This is to
facilitate above-mentioned guide-video, since guides should happen the
first time you click on this button, but you might want some standard
video to play every time you enter a screen (like, say, video of your
fumarole rumbling).
