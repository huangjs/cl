<P>This recently discovered folio edition of "Hamlet" follows other
known versions closely until Act V, Scene II, where it begins to
diverge at line 232, as will be seen:</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P>KING:             ...`Now the king drinks to Hamlet.' Come,
begin,<BR>

                        And you the judges, bear a wary eye</P>

<P><I>Trumpets sound.  HAMLET and LAERTES take their stations</I>
</P>

<P>HAMLET:       Come on, sir.</P>

<P>LAERTES:      Come, my lord.</P>

<P><I>Enter FRED, DAPHNE, VELMA, SHAGGY, AND SCOOBY</I></P>

<P>DAPHNE:       Wait!</P>

<P>SHAGGY:      Stop the fight!</P>

<P><I>HAMLET and LAERTES put up their foils</I></P>

<P>KING:            I like this not.  Say wherefore you do speak?
</P>

<P>FRED:           Good lord, I pray thee, let thy anger wait.<BR>

                     For we, in seeking clues, have found the
truth<BR>

                     Behind the strange events of latter days.</P>

<P>VELMA:      The first clue came from Elsinore's high walls,<BR>

                    Where, so said Hamlet, Hamlet's ghost did
walk.<BR>

                    Yet though the elder Hamlet met his death,<BR>

                    And perforce hath been buried in the ground,<BR>

                    'Tis yet true one would not expect a ghost<BR>

                    To carry mud upon his spectral boots.<BR>

                    Yet mud didst Shaggy and his faithful hound<BR>

                    Espy, with footprints leading to a drop.<BR>

                    This might, at first, indeed bespeak a
ghost...<BR>

                    Until, when I did seek for other answers,<BR>

                    I found a great, wide cloth of deepest black<BR>

                    Discarded in the moat of Elsinore.<BR>

                    'Tis clear, the "ghost" used this to slow his
fall<BR>

                    While darkness rendered him invisible.</P>

<P>FRED:           The second clue we found, my lord, was this.</P>

<P>KING:           It seems to me a portrait of my brother<BR>

                      In staine'd glass, that sunlight may shine
through.</P>

<P>FRED:           But see, my lord, when placed before a lantern --
</P>

<P>KING:           My brother's ghost!</P>

<P>HAMLET:     My father!</P>

<P>VELMA:       Nay, his image.</P>

<P>FRED:         In sooth, that image caught the Prince's eye<BR>

                   When he went to confront his lady mother.<BR>

                   Nor did his sword pierce poor Polonius.<BR>

                   For Hamlet's blade did mark the castle wall<BR>

                   Behind the rent made in the tapestry<BR>

&nbsp;                 Polonius was murdered by another.<BR>

                   The knife which killed him entered from behind.
</P>

<P>LAERTES:   But who?</P>

<P>FRED:         Indeed my lords, that you shall see.</P>

<P>HAMLET:    And if this ghost was naught but light and air,<BR>

                    Then what of that which I did touch and speak to?
</P>

<P><I>The GHOST enters.</I></P>

<P>GHOST:        Indeed, my son.</P>

<P>SHAGGY:     Zoinks!</P>

<P>DAPHNE:     Jenkies!</P>

<P>GHOST:      Mark them not.<BR>

                    Thou hast neglected duty far too long.<BR>

                    Shall this, my murderer, live on unharmed?<BR>

                    Must I remain forever unavenged?</P>

<P><I>SCOOBY and SHAGGY run away from the GHOST.  SCOOBY, looking
backward, runs into a tapestry, tearing it down.  As a result,
tapestries around the walls collapse, one surrounding the GHOST.</I>
</P>

<P>GHOST:     What?</P>

<P>FRED:        Good Osric, pray restrain that "ghost",<BR>

                   That we may reach the bottom of the matter.<BR>

                   Now let us see who truly walked tonight.</P>

<P><I>FRED removes the helm and the disguise from the GHOST'S
face.</I></P>

<P>ALL:          Tis Fortinbras!</P>

<P>FRED:       The valiant prince of Norway!</P>

<P>FORTINBRAS:     Indeed it is, and curses on you all!<BR>

                  This Hamlet's father brought my own to death,<BR>

                  And cost me all my rightful heritage.<BR>

                  And so I killed this king, and hoped his son<BR>

                  Would prove no obstacle to Norway's crown.<BR>

                  Then Claudius bethought himself the killer<BR>

                  (As if one might be poisoned through the ear!)<BR>

                 The brother, not the son, took Denmark's throne,<BR>

                 And held to Norway with a tighter grip.<BR>

                  I swore an end to Denmark's royal house.<BR>

                  I spoke to Hamlet of his uncle's crimes.<BR>

&nbsp;                Then killed Polonius to spark Laertes.<BR>

&nbsp;                This day, with poison's aid, all might have
died,&nbsp;<BR>

                  And Denmark might have come to me as well<BR>

                  As my beloved Norway and revenge.<BR>

                  My scheme blinded them all, as if by fog<BR>

                  But for these medd'ling kids and this their dog.
</P>

<P>KING:      The villain stands confessed.  Now let us go.<BR>

                 For much remains to us to be discussed.<BR>

                 And suitable reward must needs be found<BR>

                 For these, our young detectives and their hound.
