<H2>Fire</H2>


<div class="joke">
<P>An engineer is working at his desk in his office. His cigarette
falls off the desk into the wastebasket, causing the papers within to
burst into flames. The engineer looks around, sees a fire
extinguisher, grabs it, puts out the flames, and goes back to work.
</P>

<P>A physicist is working at his desk in another office and the same
thing happens. He looks at the fire, looks at the fire extinguisher,
and thinks "Fire requires fuel plus oxygen plus heat. The fire
extinguisher will remove both the oxygen and the heat in the
wastebasket. Ergo, no fire." He grabs the extinguisher, puts out the
flames, and goes back to work.</P>

<P>A mathematician is working at his desk in another office and the
same thing happens. He looks at the fire, looks at the fire
extinguisher, and thinks for a minute, says "Ah! A solution exists!"
and goes back to work.</P>

<H2>Woman in a bar</H2>

<div class="joke">
<P>A mathematician and an engineer are sitting at a table drinking
when a very beautiful woman walks in and sits down at the bar.</P>

<P>The mathematician sighs. "I'd like to talk to her, but first I
have to cover half the distance between where we are and where she
is, then half of the distance that remains, then half of that
distance, and so on. The series is infinite. There'll always be some
finite distance between us."</P>

<P>The engineer gets up and starts walking. "Ah, well, I figure I can get close
enough for all practical purposes."</P>
</div>

<HR>

<H2>Prime numbers</H2>

<div class="joke">
<P>A mathematician, physicist, and engineer are taking a math test.
One question asks "Are all odd numbers prime?"</P>

<P>The mathematician thinks, "3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9
is not prime -- nope, not all odd numbers are prime."</P>

<P>The physicist thinks, " 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is
not prime -- that could be experimental error -- 11 is prime, 13 is
prime, yes, they're all prime."</P>

<P>The engineer thinks, " 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is
prime, 11 is prime, ..."</P>

<H2>Sheep in Scotland</H2>

<div class="joke">
<P>A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are riding a train
through Scotland.</P>

<P>The engineer looks out the window, sees a black sheep, and
exclaims, "Hey! They've got black sheep in Scotland!"</P>

<P>The physicist looks out the window and corrects the engineer,
"Strictly speaking, all we know is that there's at least one black
sheep in Scotland."</P>

<P>The mathematician looks out the window and corrects the physicist,
" Strictly speaking, all we know is that is that at least one side of
one sheep is black in Scotland."</P>

<H2>Hunting</H2>


<div class="joke">
<p>A physicist, engineer and a statistician are out hunting. 
Suddenly, a deer appears 50 yards away.
</p>

<p>The physicist does some basic ballistic calculations, 
assuming a vacuum, lifts his rifle to a specific angle, and shoots. 
The bullet lands 5 yards short.</p>

<p>The engineer adds a fudge factor
for air resistance, lifts his rifle slightly higher, and shoots.
The bullet lands 5 yards long.</p>

<p>The statistician yells "We got him!"</p>

<H2>Difference between a mathematician and a physicist</H2>

<div class="joke">
<P>After taking a course in mathematical physics, I wanted to know
the real difference between Mathematics and Physicists.  A professor
friend told me "A Physicist is someone who averages the first 3 terms
of a divergent series" </P>

<H2>At the races</H2>


<div class="joke">
<p>A Statistician, Engineer and Physicist go to the horse track.  Each have their
system for betting on the winner and they're sure of it.</p>

<p>After the race is over, the Statistician wanders into the nearby bar,
defeated.  He notices the Engineer, sits down next to him, and begins
lamenting:  "I don't understand it.  I tabulated the recent performance of all
these horses, cross-referenced them with trends for others of their breed,
considered seasonal variability, everything.  I couldn't have lost."</p>

<p>"Yeah," says the Engineer, "well, forget that.  I ran simulations based on
their weight, mechanical ratios, performance models, everything, and I'm no
better off."</p>

<p>Suddenly, they notice a commotion in the corner.  The Physicist is sitting
there, buying rounds and counting his winnings.  The Engineer and Statistician
decide they've got to know, so they shuffle over and ask him, "what's your
secret, how'd you do it?"</p>

<p>The Physicist leans back, takes a deep breath, and begins, "Well, first I
assumed all the horses were spherical and identical..."</p>

<H2>Red rubber ball</H2>

<div class="joke">
<p>A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are given the task of
finding how high a particular red rubber ball will bounce when dropped
from a given height onto a given surface.</p>

<p>The mathematician derives the elasticity of the ball from its chemical
makeup, derives the equations to determine how high it will bounce and
calculates it.</p>

<p>The physicist takes the ball into the lab, measures its elasticity,
and plugs the variables into a formula.</p>

<p>The engineer looks it up in his red rubber ball book.</p>

<h2>Point of View</h2>

<p>A physicist, a biologist and a mathematician sit in a sidewalk cafe, looking 
at the building across the road.
Two people go into the building, then three people come out.
</p>
<p>Physicist: "This must be a measuring error!"
</p>
<p>Biologist: "This is proof of procreation!"
</p>
<p>Mathematician: "If one more person goes into the building, it will be 
empty!"

<H2>A scientific metajoke</H2>

<div class="joke">
<p>An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an
anecdote, indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have
no doubt already heard.</p>

<p>After some observations and rough calculations
the engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing.</p>

<p>A few
minutes later the physicist understands too and chuckles to himself
happily as he now has enough experimental evidence to publish a
paper.</p>

<p>This leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he
had observed right away that he was the subject of an anecdote,
and deduced quite rapidly the presence of humour from similar
anecdotes, but considers this anecdote to be too trivial a corollary
to be significant, let alone funny.</p>
