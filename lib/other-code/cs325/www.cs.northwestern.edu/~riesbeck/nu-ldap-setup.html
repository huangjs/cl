<h1>Using the Northwestern Directory as your Address Book</h1>

<p>Northwestern's LDAP directory service contains the email addresses of 
everyone at Northwestern. You can tell Thunderbird to check that directory
and complete addresses for you when you compose a new email.</p>

<table>
<tr><td><p>Click on <b>Tools | Account Settings...</b>. The Account
Settings dialog appears.</p>
<p>Click on <b>Composition & Addressing</b> under
your Northwestern email account, <tt>Use a different LDAP server:</tt>
and the button <b>Edit Directories...</b>.</p></td>
<td><img src="use-different.gif" alt=""></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>The LDAP Directory Servers dialog appears.</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Add</b> button.</td>
<td><img src="ldap-add.gif" alt=""></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>The Directory Server Properties dialog appears.</p>
<p>Fill in the <b>General</b> tab as shown. Then
click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab.</p></td>
<td><img src="nu-ldap-general.gif" alt=""></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>Fill in the <b>Advanced</b> tab as shown. Then
click on <b>OK</b>.</td>
<td><img src="nu-ldap-advanced.gif" alt=""></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>Select <tt>NU LDAP</tt> from the list of LDAP directories,
and click OK again.</td>
<td><img src="use-nu-ldap.gif" alt=""></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Test your settings by creating a new email and typing a few characters of
someone's name into the <b>To</b> field. Wait a few seconds and see if auto-completion
presents a menu of names that match what you typed.</p>

<p>Note: for me, auto-completion of addresses does not work
if I try to use NU LDAP as my global LDAP server, even though 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317566">a bug report
on this problem</a> says it has been fixed.</p>
