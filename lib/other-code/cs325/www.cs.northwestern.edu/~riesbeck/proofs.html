<H1>Dana Angluin's List of Proof Techniques</H1>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<DL>
   <DT>Proof by example:
   
   <DD>The author gives only the case n=2 and suggests that it
   contains most of the ideas of the general proof.
   
   <DT>Proof by intimidation:
   
   <DD>'Trivial.'
   
   <DT>Proof by vigorous handwaving:
   
   <DD>Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.
   
   <DT>Proof by cumbersome notation:
   
   <DD>Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
   symbols.
   
   <DT>Proof by exhaustion:
   
   <DD>An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.
   
   <DT>Proof by omission:
   
   <DD>'The reader may easily supply the details.'<BR>
   
   'The other 253 cases are analogous.'<BR>
   
   '...'
   
   <DT>Proof by obfuscation:
   
   <DD>A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless
   syntactically related statements.
   
   <DT>Proof by wishful citation:
   
   <DD>The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of
   a theorem from the literature to support his claims.
   
   <DT>Proof by funding:
   
   <DD>How could three different government agencies be wrong?
   
   <DT>Proof by eminent authority:
   
   <DD>'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably
   NP-complete.'
   
   <DT>Proof by personal communication:
   
   <DD>'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete'
   [Karp, personal commmunication].
   
   <DT>Proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
   
   <DD>'To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is
   decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.'
   
   <DT>Proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
   
   <DD>The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found
   in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian Philological
   Society, 1883.
   
   <DT>Proof by importance:
   
   <DD>A large body of useful consequences all follow from the
   proposition in question.
   
   <DT>Proof by accumulated evidence:
   
   <DD>Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.
   
   <DT>Proof by cosmology:
   
   <DD>The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or
   meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.
   
   <DT>Proof by mutual reference:
   
   <DD>In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in
   reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in
   reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in
   reference A.
   
   <DT>Proof by meta-proof:
   
   <DD>A method is given to construct the desired proof. The
   correctness of the method is proved by any of these techniques.
   
   <DT>Proof by picture:
   
   <DD>A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well with
   proof by omission.
   
   <DT>Proof by vehement assertion:
   
   <DD>It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the
   audience.
   
   <DT>Proof by ghost reference:
   
   <DD>Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in
   the reference given.
   
   <DT>Proof by forward reference:
   
   <DD>Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author,
   which is often not as forthcoming as at first.
   
   <DT>Proof by semantic shift:
   
   <DD>Some standard but inconvenient definitions are changed for the
   statement of the result.
   
   <DT>Proof by appeal to intuition:
   
   <DD>Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.
   
   <DT>Proof by elimination of the counterexample:
   
   <DD>'Assume for the moment that the hypothesis is true. Now, let's
   suppose we find a counterexample. So what? QED.' (from Don Woods
   &lt;DON@SU-AI.ARPA&gt;)
