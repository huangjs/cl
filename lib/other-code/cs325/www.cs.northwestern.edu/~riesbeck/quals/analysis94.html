<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>94 Programming Question</H1>

<P>The conditions in the question can be described more abstractly as
follows. You are given:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>a set of <EM>fact sets</EM> of the form
   
   <UL>
      {fact1, fact2, ...}
   </UL>
   
   <P>where exactly one fact in each set must be true,</P>
   
   <LI>a set of <EM>rule sets</EM>, each of the form
   
   <UL>
      result1 IF fact1 AND fact2 ...
      
      <P>result2 IF fact1 AND fact2 ...</P>
      
      <P>...</P>
   </UL>
   
   <P>where there may be more than one set of facts leading to the
   same result, and exactly one result is possible for each rule set
   in any scenario,</P>
   
   <LI>and a <EM>scenario</EM>, which is a proposition of the form
   
   <UL>
      fact1 AND fact2 AND ...
   </UL>
</UL>

<P>With these abstractions, we can describe the two functions asked
for as follows:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><TT>do-probe</TT> should select the result whose facts all
   appear in the current scenario, and
   
   <LI><TT>consistent-p</TT> should return true for a given fact only
   if that fact can't be proven false by the results seen so far.
</UL>

<H1>Assess Your Comments</H1>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did you specify in your documentation what
should happen if more than one rule for a test applies in a
scenario?</U> Just implementing one possibility is not enough. A
clarification of the original specification should be given. It might
be "all results implied by a scenario will be returned," "the rules
are checked in order and the first result is returned," or "only one
result should be possible." The latter implies that the
implementation should signal an error to the implementors if it finds
more than one possible result.</P>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did you specify whether a fact could appear
in more than one fact set?</U> Either way might make sense. If fact
sets are intended to represent values of an attribute, which is what
they sort of look like in the given example, then a particular fact
should appear in only one fact set. If fact sets are intended to
represent propositions of the form "one and only one of the following
must be true," then a particular fact could appear in many fact sets.
Again, an implementation could support either interpretation. It's
the specification that needs fixing.</P>

<H1>AI Issues</H1>

<P>This problem was inspired by work that was being done with the
GBS-Lite Tool. That tool is intended to make it simple for course
authors to create goal-based scenarios where, among other things,
students run experiments and deriving a valid conclusion from the
results.</P>

<P>More generally, this problem has the typical elements of an AI
diagnosis system. There are hidden internal states, e.g., diseases,
and visible external results, e.g., symptoms. The system under
consideration is <EM>model-based</EM>, because the causal rules go
from states to symptoms, not about from symptoms to states.</P>

<P>It should be obvious from the summary that propositional logic is
a central issue here. One direct approach to the problem is to build
a propositional theorem prover. There are significant limits in the
"theorems" that are actually needed. For example, there is no
chaining of inferences. Each "theorem" is one inference long. Hence,
simpler solutions should exist. One of them is to
<A HREF="solution94.html">build a table</A>.</P>

<H1>Assess Your Solution</H1>

<H2><TT>do-probe</TT></H2>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did you get a working implementation of
</U><TT><U>do-probe</U></TT><U>?</U> It's a very straightforward
search for an element or elements of a list.</P>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did you use the right rule for picking a
result?</U> The right rule is that the set of facts in the rule is a
<STRONG>subset</STRONG> of the set of facts in the scenario? Possible
mistakes: using intersection instead of subset, requiring only one
fact to be true, failing to check for more than one fact in a rule.
</P>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Was your loop consistent with your explicit
or implicit resolution to the multiple results issue?</U> Several
people wrote loops for <TT>do-probe</TT> that could easily return
more than one result, but only two people noted that this was an
issue.</P>

<H2><TT>consistent-p</TT></H2>

<P>As should be clear from the above discussion,
<TT>consistent-p</TT> is hard. No one got a correct working solution,
but I didn't expect one. I was hoping for an outline of a simple
propositional reasoner. I didn't get that either.</P>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did your code work by seeing if the fact in
question causes the results seen so far?</U> This doesn't work. A
result that's been seen might depend on other facts in the scenario.
</P>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did your code work by deleting facts from a
list of possible facts, when the results they implied failed to
occur?</U> This is wrong. It only works for test results that are
caused by only one fact. The question explicitly said this was not
always the case. In general, if a test result is false, then all you
know is that at least of the facts that can cause it is false, but
not which one. It's the accumulation of these disjunctions that makes
the problem tricky.</P>

<P><A NAME="example-return"></A>In fact, even if you assume that all
rules only have one fact in them, this approach doesn't work. Gregg
Collins generated <A HREF="counterexample94.html">a simple
example</A> showing that this approach will fail to notice some facts
are inconsistent.</P>

<P><B>Self-check</B> <U>Did you note the logical deficiencies of your
solution?</U> I would have awarded full, or almost full credit, to
anyone who wrote the "delete facts" code, had they included a decent
description of the many things it didn't handle.</P>
