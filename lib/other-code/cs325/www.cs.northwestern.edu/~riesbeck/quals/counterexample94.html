<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Simple Tricky Example</H1>

<P>Suppose we have:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>two sets of facts, <CODE>{fact1, fact2}</CODE> and
   <CODE>{fact3, fact4}</CODE>, among others
   
   <LI>two tests <CODE>s</CODE> and <CODE>t</CODE>, with the
   following rules, plus possibly others which don't involve these
   facts or test results:
</UL>

<PRE>	s-result1 IF f<CODE>act</CODE>1 
     s-result1 IF f<CODE>act</CODE>3 
     ... 
     t-result1 IF f<CODE>act</CODE>1
     t-result1 IF f<CODE>act</CODE>4
     ... </PRE>

<P>Now assume that the student gets <CODE>s-result1</CODE> and
<CODE>t-result1</CODE>, and the question is "Is <CODE>fact2</CODE>
consistent with those results?"</P>

<P>Since <CODE>fact2</CODE> doesn't predict any results, it can't be
ruled out directly by any result that does or doesn't occur. And yet
<CODE>fact2</CODE> is, in fact, provably inconsistent with the above
results. Why? Because </P>

<UL>
   <LI>If <CODE>s-result1</CODE> and <CODE>t-result1</CODE> are both
   true, then <CODE>fact1 OR fact3</CODE> and <CODE>fact1 OR
   fact4</CODE> are both true. 
   
   <LI><CODE>fact3</CODE> and <CODE>fact4</CODE> can't both be true,
   therefore one has to be false. 
   
   <LI>Making either one false means <CODE>fact1</CODE> has to be
   true. 
   
   <LI><CODE>fact1</CODE> and <CODE>fact2</CODE> can't both be true,
   so <CODE>fact2</CODE> has to be false.
</UL>

<P>Hence, even if the rules were constrained to single causes, which
they weren't, you would still need something equivalent to a
propositional theorem prover.</P>
