<h1>2004 AI Qual Programming Question</h1>

<hr>
<p>
Congratulations! <b>60-Minute Software</b>
("ready in an hour or it's free") has hired you to write a Semantic Web knowledge 
interchange tool. A common technique, used in RDF and OWL, is to map user-friendly nested 
frame structures to flat lists of "subject predicate object" triples, and back. 
For example, in list form, a publishing event
</p>

<blockquote><pre>(publish-event
  (published
    (book (title "The Eat Skin Diet")
          (author (person (name "Carrie N. Eater")))))
  (publisher "Simon's Shoestore")
  (year "2004"))</pre></blockquote>

<p>might be mapped to:</p>

<blockquote><pre>((node100 type publish-event)
 (node100 published node101)
 (node100 publisher "Simon's Shoestore")
 (node100 year "2004")
 (node101 type book)
 (node101 title "The Eat Skin Diet")
 (node101 author node102)
 (node102 type person)
 (node102 name "Carrie N. Eater"))</pre></blockquote>
    
<p>The order and specific node ID's generated don't matter. Using any 
language that can support nested list-like structures like the above, wr
ite code to (1) map a structure to a set of triples, with ID's generated 
as necessary, (2) map a set of triples to a nested structure. You can 
assume that any such set of triples does in fact represent a nested 
structure.</p>

<p><b>60MS</b> is most concerned about the core mapping algorithms, 
not I/O, and code that is as clear and general as possible.</p>
