<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1994 Qual Programming Question</H1>

<P>This document discusses the Lisp programming question for the 1994
Ph.D. Qualifying Exam in Artificial Intelligence, given at the
Institute for the Learning Sciences. You should first read the
question below and try to do the problem yourself. If you want to put
yourself in the position of the students who took the qual, give
yourself one hour.</P>

<P>After doing the problem, read <A HREF="analysis94.html">an
analysis of the problem</A>. This will help you "grade" your
solution.</P>

<P>Finally, for comparison purposes, you can look at my
<A HREF="solution94.html">solution</A>. It was <EM>not</EM> done in
an hour.</P>

<HR>

<P>Congratulations! You've been hired to help build UGH (the Ultimate
GBS Helper), a tool for making simple investigate goal-based scenario
systems. An investigative GBS has the following standard structure:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The student has to determine which of several possible
outcome actions to do, by doing a series of probes (experiments,
explorations, etc.) to gather evidence for some hypothesis about
what's going on in the scenario.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For example, in a sickle cell counselor GBS, there are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><U>Possible hypotheses</U>: The husband and the wife have
   either sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, or neither.
   
   <LI><U>Outcome actions</U>: Tell them that their children might
   inherit the disease, the trait, or neither.
   
   <LI><U>Probe actions</U>: Looking at the husband's or wife's blood
   with a microscope, or doing a genetic analysis with an
   electrophoresis machine.
</UL>

<P>Each probe yields a particular result, and each result is evidence
for or against one or more hypotheses. A key issue in such a GBS is
noticing when the student selects an outcome action that is either
unjustified by or inconsistent with the results of the probes done so
far.</P>

<H1>Your job</H1>

<P>Your job is to write the module that keeps track of the student's
probes and the hypotheses they affect. Other parts of the UGH system
will handle the interface and deciding how to respond if the student
selects an unjustified or inconsistent outcome action.</P>

<P>The UGH group has already defined some simple representations for
the sickle cell application to help you design your module.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>(setq *possible-facts*
   `((husband-has-disease husband-has-trait husband-ok)
     (wife-has-disease    wife-has-trait    wife-ok)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><TT>&nbsp;</TT></PRE>

<P><TT>*possible-facts*</TT> holds a list of lists of facts. Exactly
one fact in each set has to be true.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>(setq *probe-results*
   `((look-husband-blood
       (husband-sickle-blood husband-has-disease)
	  (husband-round-blood husband-has-trait)
	  (husband-round-blood husband-ok))
	(electro-husband-blood
	  (husband-trait-sign husband-has-disease)
	  (husband-trait-sign husband-has-trait)
	  (husband-no-trait-sign husband-ok))
      ...
	))</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><TT>&nbsp;</TT></PRE>

<P><TT>*probe-results*</TT> says how facts affect probe results. Each
item in the list is the name of a possible probe action, followed by
lists of results and the facts that have to be true for that result
to occur. Although it doesn't occur here, if a particular result is
followed by several fact names, that means that all those facts have
to be true for a particular result to occur. Notice that the same
result, e.g., seeing round blood cells, may occur for more than one
reason--that's what makes investigations tricky! The remaining items
in the above list, for looking at the wife's blood, should be
obvious.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>(setq *scenario* `(husband-has-trait wife-ok))</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A scenario is just a consistent set of true facts. In this
scenario, the husband has the sickle cell trait, but the wife has
neither the disease nor the trait.</P>

<P>Specify the design (and as much implementation as you have time
for) for the following functions:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><TT>do-probe</TT>(<I>probe-name</I>, <I>scenario</I>) --
   returns the result of the probe for the given set of facts. For
   simplicity, in an UGH investigative GBS, probe actions do not
   affect the facts in a scenario. 
   
   <P>Ex. <TT>(do-probe 'look-wife-blood)</TT> should return
   <TT>wife-round-blood</TT>.</P>
   
   <LI><TT>consistent-p</TT>(<I>fact-name</I>) -- returns true if the
   fact named has not been disproven by the results of any probes
   done so far. 
   
   <P>Ex. <TT>(consistent-p 'wife-has-disease)</TT> should return
   false after the <TT>do-probe</TT> just mentioned, but
   <TT>(consistent-p `wife-has-trait)</TT> should still return true.
   </P>
</UL>

<P>The UGH group is working under tight memory constraints. There's
no room for loading some constraint maintenance package. You have to
do all this in regular Common Lisp.</P>

<P>Since you may be taken off the project at any time, even at an
hour's notice, describe your algorithms well enough so that another
programmer could take over.</P>

<P>As you do this, you should also comment on any flaws (fatal or
inconvenient) that you see in the above scheme. Are there kinds of
evidential relationships between results and hypotheses that can't be
represented? Are there kinds of justification relationships between
hypotheses and outcome actions that can't be represented?</P>
