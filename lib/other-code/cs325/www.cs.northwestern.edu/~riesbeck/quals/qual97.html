   <TITLE>The job of the Lisp Critiquer is to find predictable
   mistakes
   in novice Lisp code, including stylistic problems. One of the most
   common
   problems is functions that are too long, but this is also one of
   the hardest to
   implement. Riesbeck complains whenever </TITLE>

<P>Give yourself 1 hour to read, think, and code a solution.
Afterwards, compare your solution with <A HREF="ans97.html">this
analysis</A>.</P>

<P>OK, enough is enough! I'm tired of telling all these novice Lisp
programs that their functions that are too long. Define a predicate
that returns true if and only if a function definition is too "long."
It should take the function definition as a list, not a string. It
should probably also take one or more "threshold" parameters to let
me adjust the allowable length for different exercises. Exactly what
measures these thresholds control is up to you.</P>

<P>Some examples of real code are given below, roughly in order of
increasing badness. <TT>replace-hex-escape</TT> was <B>not</B>
considered too long. The rest were. In particular,
<TT>difference-one-do</TT> is significantly worse than
<TT>replace-hex-escape</TT> even though it only has a few more atoms
and doesn't nest as deeply.</P>

<P>Program for flexibility. It should be easy to change the scoring
algorithm and for a Lisp programmer like me to specify
context-specific rules, such as "deprecate nesting more when it
occurs in the tests of cond's and if's and do's."</P>
