<h1>A Non-Theorem Proving Solution</h1>

<p>There's a useful <strong>often overlooked</strong> solution to the
problem of implementing a complex dynamic process: <strong>table
lookup</strong>. The trick is to build a table ahead of time of all
possible answers, and then just look them up at run-time.</p>

<p>This technique works whenever there is a finite number of possible
answers, and works well when the number of table entries relatively
small or searching the table is cheap.</p>

<p>At the very least, significant time can be saved. In this
situation, however, the programming complexity is also greatly
reduced, because it's almost trivial to generate all possible
answers. The hard part is working backwards.</p>

<p>Therefore, one simple solution to implement does the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Build a table of all possible scenarios and the test results
   they generate. It's easy to generate all possible scenarios with a
   simple loop over the fact sets, and easy to generate the results
   by calling <code>do-probe</code></li>
   
   <li>At run-time, to see if a fact is consistent with some partial
   set of results, look to see if there's at least one line of the
   table containing both the fact in question and the results given.
   This is a simple loop with a simple match function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this solution easily supports asking whether some
conjunction of facts is consistent with the current set of results.
It's feasible in any GBS-Lite kind of situation, because there are
never more than a handful of internal states to discover, or more
than a handful of tests to run. In addition, if the states and test
results are put in the table in a canonical order, as the
implementation does, then the match function is very simple and
efficient.</p>

<h1>The Implementation</h1>

<p>This <a href="code94.html">implementation</a> is much cleaner than
anyone would be expected to write in an hour, with everything divided
up into simple subfunctions. However, if you look at
<code><a href="code94.html#do-probe">do-probe</a></code>,
<code><a href="code94.html#consistent-p">consistent-p</a></code>, and
<code><a href="code94.html#generate-scenario-results">generate-scenario-results</a></code>,
you'll see that all three are fairly simple.</p>
